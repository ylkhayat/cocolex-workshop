      "    \"previous_text\": \"TUTTLE, Chief Judge.\\nThis appeal is from judgment for plaintiff-appellee in a patent infringement suit, Ibis Enterprises, Ltd. v. Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court\\u2019s findings of fact as follows:\\n1. Parties\\nPlaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.\\n2. Civil Action\\nThis is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.\\n3. Background of Patentee\\nDavid F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the \\u201cVidal\\u201d process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: \\u201chand lay-up\\u201d and \\u201cmatched die (or metal) mold\\u201d (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).\\n4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method\\nThe \\u201cVidal\\u201d process involved, in part, the \\u201chand lay-up\\u201d process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the \\u201cVidal\\u201d process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).\\n5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method\\n(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called \\u201cmatched metal mold\\u201d or \\u201cmatched die\\u201d process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).\\n(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).\\n6. Anderson Early Work and Invention\\n(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the \\u201cmatched metal mold\\u201d process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *\\n7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125\\n(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;\\n\\u201cthe depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.\\u201d (Column 2, lines 39-52).\\nThe form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).\\n(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:\\n\\u201cThe present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.\\u201d (Column 1, lines 55-65).\\n'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed \\u25a0only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim \\u25a06). * * \\u25a0*\\n11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit\\n(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).\\n(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff\\u2019s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend \\u201cPatented Process\\u201d while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs\\u2019 Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *\\nYj * * *\\n(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).\\n(b) In the Defendant\\u2019s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).\\n18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs\\u2019\\nEach of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).\\nAt this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the \\u201cclearly erroneous\\u201d limitation.\\nSecond, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of \\u201cprimary,\\u201d as opposed to \\u201cultimate\\u201d fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \\u00a7 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).\\nThird, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court\\u2019s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court\\u2019s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.\\nFourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.\\nDirecting our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson \\u2019125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the \\u201crather severe test\\u201d promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there \\u201cany unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?\\u201d Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to \\u201cscrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.\\u201d Ibid.\\nIn light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson\\u2019s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.\\nAs the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general \\u2014 problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the \\u201cclearly erroneous\\u201d limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.\\nIt is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson\\u2019s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson\\u2019s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).\\nPursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson\\u2019s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of \\u201cobviousiness\\u201d and \\u201cnewness\\u201d of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes \\u2014 both relating to the making of pre-form \\u2014 combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).\\nThe final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson\\u2019s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at\\n143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, \\u201cin that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.\\u201d (Anderson deposition at 117).\\nA discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court\\u2019s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court\\u2019s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had \\u201cabandoned\\u201d its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility\\u2019s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson\\u2019s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.\\nAlthough certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson\\u2019s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.\\nThe California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson\\u2019s case for improvement over the prior art as being \\u201climited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.\\u201d Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).\\nHaving thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson\\u2019s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention \\u2014 subjecting Anderson \\u2019125 to the \\u201crather severe test\\u201d outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson \\u2019125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of \\u201cobviousness\\u201d of the Anderson combination.\\nWhile it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus \\u201coccurred to me the moment I saw the roving.\\u201d (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or \\u201951, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson \\u2019125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson\\u2019s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson\\u2019s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).\\nFrom this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson \\u2019125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in \\u201cany unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.\\u201d Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining \\u201cobviousness\\u201d under 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve \\u2014 the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .\\nTo summarize, the Anderson \\u2019125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements \\u201cperform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.\\u201d Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that\\n\\u201cpatentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun \\u2014 a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.\\u201d\\nOur conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson \\u2019125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.\\nImplicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.\\n\",\n",

Having concluded that the Anderson \\u2019125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise.

The conventional thread winding machine, which has been modified, consists broadly of a tensioning device through which the thread passes from a supply source, a rotating spindle on to which the tensioned thread is wound after passing through a thread traversing and guiding device, and a stopping lever which is activated by loss in tension or breakage of the thread to stop the winding machine. Appellant\\u2019s stopping lever replaces the stopping lever of the conventional machine. This improved lever is pivoted to a portion of the machine, and has three arms mounted thereon in fixed relationship to each other. The relationship between these three arms and the remainder of the machine is as follows: Two of the arms of the stopping lever engage the portion of the thread which extends between the tension-ing device and the thread traversing and guiding device. The first of these arms is supported on the thread being wound, and the second arm (referred to as a tensioning arm) supports the thread being wound. When the tension of the thread decreases, or when it breaks, the first and second arms will drop as a unit and cause the stopping lever to which they are affixed to pivot. Thus, the third arm, because of its fixed relationship to the other two arms, will also pivot and engage a cam which in turn causes a brake to stop the machine. It is to be noted at this point that the only difference between the stopping lever of a conventional thread winding machine and the subject matter recited in the appealed claims is the presence of the second of the above mentioned arms which is affixed to said stopping lever.\\nClaims 9,15, and 17 are considered to be representative of those appealed, and read as follows:\\n9. In a thread tension control stop member for winding machines of the type having a thread tension device, a thread guide remotely positioned therefrom, a power control device, a pivoted sector shaped latch for the power control device having a free end located between the tension device and the thread guide, a cam shaft a stepped release cam on the cam shaft and a pivoted lever system for actuating the power control device, the improvement comprising in combination a support for mounting the lever in rocking relation on the free end of the sector, a thread bar extending from said support toward the tension device for support on a thread running from the device to the thread guide, a trip leg-extending from said support into proximity to the stepped release cam, whereby rocking movement of the lever will project the free end of said trip leg into contact with the cam, and a tension arm extending generally upwardly and outwardly from said support adapted to guide the thread in an angularly disposed path running from the tension device to the thread guide, said tension arm being adapted to render effective the movement of said trip leg into contact with said cam upon release of said thread bar by breakage of thread or loss of tension therein.\\n15. In a winding machine of the type including a stop cam, a stop member adapted to be positioned in spaced relation to said cam and for movement into operative contact therewith, a thread supported member for positioning said stop member in spaced relation to said cam, the improvement comprising in combination therewith a thread supporting member to render effective the movement of said stop member into contact with said cam upon release of said thread supported member upon breakage of thread or loss of tension therein.\\n17. In a thread winding machine wherein thread passes from a tension device to a traverse device and over an arm constituted as a thread bar of a pivoted multi-arm lever system adapted to actuate means for stopping operation of said machine upon breakage of the thread or failure of the supply thereof and wherein said stopping means includes a rotating cam against which another arm constituted as a trip leg of said lever system is moved upon breakage of the thread or failure of the supply thereof and by means of which cam it is lifted to initiate stopping of the machine, the improvement wherein said lever system comprises in combination a hub portion for pivoting said system on the machine, a thread bar carried by and extending outwardly from said hub and against which the thread issuing from the tension device normally bears, a trip leg carried by and extending outwardly from said hub in angular direction with respect to said thread bar and normally out of contact with the rotating cam of the machine, and an additional arm constituted as a thread tension arm carried by and extending outwardly from said hub in a direction oppositely disposed with respect to said trip leg and at a point in the path of the thread passing from the thread bar to the traverse guide to impart sufficient additional tension to the entire lever system upon breakage of the thread to effect rapid pivoting of said lever system and movement of said trip leg into engagement with said rotating cam for actuating the stopping means.\\nThe references relied on by the Patent Office are:\\nCannon, 1,595,705, August 10,1926.\\nSpangler et al., 2,361,426, October 31,1944.\\nLeboeey (France), 558,309, May 23,1923.\\nThe Spangler et al. patent discloses a conventional thread winding machine, as described above. The only difference between this machine and the appealed claims is that it lacks the second arm (tension-ing arm) which was described above as being affixed to the stopping lever. In the Spangler et al. machine, insofar as pertinent to the claims under consideration, the stopping lever consists of two arms which are affixed to a pivoted member. The first of these arms is supported on a portion of the thread which extends between a tension-ing device and a thread traversing mechanism. If the thread breaks, or if the tension thereof decreases, the first arm will drop, thereby causing the stopping lever to pivot, which in turn causes the second arm to engage a cam which coacts with other mechanism to stop the winding machine.\\nThe Cannon patent discloses a stopping device for yarn winding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yarn exceeds a predetermined amount, the arms are caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of. increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant\\u2019s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof.\\nThe Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel. When the thread breaks (or when the tension thereof decreases), the arm drops and a linkage connected to the arm is moved to disengage the spindle of the machine. The second modification shows a system in which the machine is stopped when the tension in the thread exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this modification which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows a stopping mechanism consisting in part of three arms pivoted to a common pivot point on the machine. Boilers are affixed to two of these arms. The thread passes under one roller and over another en route from the supply reel to the take-up reel. As the tension in the portion of the thread which extends between the reels increases, at least one of the arms is caused to pivot which in turn causes the third of said arms to pivot. The third arm is mechanically linked to a latch which causes disengagement of the winding machine when the tension in the thread exceeds a predetermined amount and thereby causes said third arm to move a predetermined distance.\\nThe examiner rejected all of the claims on Spangler in view of either Cannon or Lebocey. The Board of Appeals affirmed the examiner\\u2019s rejection. In so doing, the board in essence stated that but for the additional tension arm mounted on the hub of appellant\\u2019s stop lever system, the positive stop device of appellant\\u2019s winding machine is the same as that disclosed by the Spangler et al. patent. The board further stated that upon carefully comparing the results produced by Spangler et al. and appellant\\u2019s device, the difference between the respective results is one of degree only. The board further stated that there is nothing new in taking advantage of a third arm in an armed lever system, as shown by the secondary references, for more effectively controlling stoppage of a mechanism, whether the lever system responds to an increase or decrease in tension of the thread. It is apparent from the record that the board was also of the opinion that the claims were unpatentable over Spangler et al., taken alone. The board stated that the additional tension arm of appellant\\u2019s device merely served the purpose of providing an increased gravitational action to the Spangler et al. stopping lever, and that anyone skilled in the art, finding the Spangler et al. stopping device sluggish, could modify the device so as to increase its unbalanced moment and thereby accelerate its stopping action, whether in the manner proposed by appellant or in any other way without a display of uncommon talent.\\nThus the basic issue before this Court is whether the addition of the tension arm to the Spangler et al. mechanism for the purpose of stopping the machine more quickly in case of loss of tension of the thread or breakage thereof involves invention or mechanical skill.\\n\\u2022 Since the claims on appeal recite structure which is shown to be conventional in Spangler et al. except for the above mentioned additional tension arm, we do not deem it necessary to discuss this conventional structure further, and we will confine the remainder of this decision to the above mentioned issue and to the arguments made by appellant for patentability.\\nAs stated above, the board relied on Spangler et al. alone to reject the claims. The board stated that the tension arm merely serves the purpose of providing increased gravitational action to the stopping lever of Spangler et al., and that anyone skilled in the art, finding the Spangler et al. machine sluggish, could, without a display of uncommon talent, modify the Spangler et al. machine in the manner disclosed by appellant in order to improve its stopping action. However, appellant contends that the force which causes faster stopping of his machine is not the increased gravitational action, as stated by the board, but the proper balan\\u00e9e of the friction and tension on the additional (tension) arm. These different contentions, relating to the theory of operation of appellant\\u2019s stopping lever are, in our opinion, collateral to the basic issue of whether the improvement of the stopping lever involves invention or mechanical skill since, regardless of which theory of operation is correct, all that has been accomplished is that the existing stopping lever of a conventional machine has been made more sensitive to the thread which controls its operation.\\nThere can be no doubt that appellant has made an improvement. However, an improvement does not necessarily involve invention. In re Wilson, 32 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1193, 150 F. (2d) 548, 66 USPQ 245. Improvements which are in the realm of mechanical skill do not justify patent protection. In re Jannell, 28 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1262, 120 F. (2d) 1012, 50 USPQ 51. Furthermore, it is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result. In re Kaufmann, 39 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 769, 193 F. (2d) 331, 92 USPQ 141.\\nWe feel that we have a situation here which falls squarely within the foregoing principles, especially the one set forth in In re Kaufmann, supra. It appears to us, as it did to the Board of Appeals, that anyone finding the operation of the Spangler et al. machine sluggish, could by the exercise of mechanical skill effectuate the given result of causing the stopping lever to operate more quickly by adding an additional arm and thus making it more sensitive. We must therefore sustain the rejection of the claims on Spangler et al.\\nSince the rejection on Spangler et al. must be sustained, there is ordinarily no need to consider the other rejections of the claims. In re Miller, 34 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 910, 159 F. (2d) 756, 72 USPQ 512. However, we feel that such consideration is necessary in the present case since we do not fully agree with the rejection of the claims on Spangler et al. in view of Cannon or Lebocey. As stated above, we feel that the claims are unpatentable over the Spangler et al. patent. However, we feel that the use of Cannon and Lebocey with Spangler et al. adds nothing to the anticipatory value of Spangler et al. when used alone. The manner in which, the references were combined is stated aboye. It can readily be seen from the descriptions that the three-armed stopping levers stop the winding machines of the secondary references only on increase in tension of the thread while the stopping lever of Spangler et al. stops the winding machine oh a decrease in tension, or breakage, of the thread. Thus, there is a decided difference in operation between the machines of the secondary references as compared with the machine of the primary reference.\\nIt is well settled that prior patents may be combined to anticipate claims. In re DeLancey, 37 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 760, 177 F. (2d) 377, 83 USPQ 388. However, one limitation which should be considered when references are combined is whether these references suggest doing the thing which applicant has done. In re Fridolph, 30 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 939, 134 F. (2d) 414, 57 USPQ 122. In the present case, we feel that the combination of references was not made in accordance with the principle of In re Fridolph, supra, which is controlling here, since there is no suggestion in any of the references which would indicate that the disclosures of the secondary references could modify Spangler et al. to give appellant\\u2019s structure and result.\\nIn our opinion, the modification of Spangler et al. as taught by the secondary references would result in a winding machine which would be caused to stop on increased tension of the thread, and not in a machine which would be caused to stop on decrease in tension of the thread, as disclosed by appellant. We feel that this is a case where the references were put together after appellant\\u2019s teaching was known, and that the secondary references themselves would not have suggested the modification of the Spangler et al. machine to give the machine disclosed by appellant. We are of the opinion that since the teachings of the secondary references add nothing to the teaching of Spangler et al., that this combination of references is improper and cannot be sustained even though we have found the claims to be un-patentable over the disclosure of Spangler et al. when used by itself.\\nAppellant states in his brief that the plant where appellant is employed is now completely equipped with his improvement. This was apparently brought out for the purpose of indicating commercial success. However, this Court may not consider the aforesaid matter which appears in appellant\\u2019s brief since it is not in the record. In re Spohn, 22 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1304, 77 F. (2d) 768, 25 USPQ 409.\\nSince we have found the claims to be unpatentable over Spangler et al., the decision appealed from is affirmed. \\u2022 .\"\n",

The conventional thread winding machine, which has been modified, consists broadly of a tensioning device through which the thread passes from a supply source, a rotating spindle on to which the tensioned thread is wound after passing through a thread traversing and guiding device, and a stopping lever which is activated by loss in tension or breakage of the thread to stop the winding machine.

It is to be noted at this point that the only difference between the stopping lever of a conventional thread winding machine and the subject matter recited in the appealed claims is the presence of the second of the above mentioned arms which is affixed to said stopping lever.\\nClaims 9, 15, and 17 are considered to be representative of those appealed, and read as follows:\\n\\u201c9.

The only difference between this machine and the appealed claims is that it lacks the second arm (tensioning arm) which was described above as being affixed to the stopping lever. In the Spangler et al. machine, insofar as pertinent to the claims under consideration, the stopping lever consists of two arms which are affixed to a pivoted member. The first of these arms is supported on a portion of the thread which extends between a tensioning device and a thread traversing mechanism. If the thread breaks, or if the tension thereof decreases, the first arm will drop, thereby causing the stopping lever to pivot, which in turn causes the second arm to engage a cam which co-acts with other mechanism to stop the winding machine.\\nThe Cannon patent discloses a stopping device for yarn winding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant\\u2019s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof.\\nThe Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel. When the thread breaks (or when the tension thereof decreases), the arm drops and a linkage connected to the arm is moved to disengage the spindle of the machine. The second modification shows a system in which the machine is stopped when the tension in the thread exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this modification which is pertinent to the claims under consid\\u00e9ration shows a stopping mechanism consisting in part of three arms pivoted to a common pivot point on the machine. Rollers are affixed to two of these arms. The thread passes under one roller and over another enroute from the 'supply reel to the take-up reel. As the tension in the portion of the thread which extends between the reels increases, \\u00a1 at least one of the arms is caused to pivot which in turn causes the third of said arms to pivot. The third arm is mechanically linked to a latch which causes disengagement of the winding machine when the tension in the thread exceeds a predetermined amount and thereby causes said third arm to move a predetermined distance.\\nThe examiner rejected all of the claims on Spangler in view of either Cannon or Lebocey. The Board of Appeals affirmed the examiner\\u2019s rejection. In so doing, the board in essence stated that but for the additional tension arm mounted on the hub of appellant\\u2019s stop lever system, the positive stop device of appellant\\u2019s winding machine is the same as that disclosed by the Spangler et al. patent.

The board stated that the additional tension arm of appellant\\u2019s device merely served the purpose of providing an increased gravitational action to the Spangler et al. stopping lever, and that any one skilled in the art, finding the Spangler et al. stopping device sluggish, could modify the device so as to increase its unbalanced moment and thereby accelerate its stopping action, whether in the manner proposed by appellant or in any other way without a display of uncommon talent.\\nThus the basic issue before this Court is whether the addition of the tension arm to the Spangler et al. mechanism for the purpose of stopping the machine more quickly in case of loss of tension of the thread or breakage thereof involves invention or mechanical skill.\\nSince the claims on appeal recite structure which is shown to be conventional in Spangler et al. except for the above mentioned additional tension arm, we do not deem it necessary to discuss this conventional structure further, and we will confine the remainder of this decision to the above mentioned issue and to the arguments made by appellant for patentability.\\nAs stated above, the board relied on Spangler et al. alone to reject the claims. The board stated that the tension arm merely serves the purpose of providing increased gravitational action to the stopping lever of Spangler et al., and that any one skilled in the art, finding the Spangler et al. machine sluggish, could, without a display of uncommon talent, modify the Spangler et al. machine in the manner disclosed by appellant in order to improve its stopping action. However, appellant contends that the force which causes faster stopping of his machine is not the increased gravitational action, as stated by the board, but the proper balance of the friction and tension on the additional (tension) arm. These different contentions, relating to the theory of operation of appellant\\u2019s stopping lever are, in our opinion, collateral to the basic issue of whether the improvement of the stopping lever involves invention or mechanical skill since, regardless of which theory of operation is correct, all that has been accomplished is that the existing stopping lever of a conventional machine has been made more sensitive to the thread which controls its operation.\\nThere can be no doubt that appellant has made an improvement. However, an improvement does not necessarily involve invention. In re Wilson, 150 F.2d 548, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1193. Improvements which are in the realm of mechanical skill do not justify patent protection. In re Jannell, 120 F.2d 1012, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1262. Furthermore, it is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result. In re Kauf- mann, 193 F.2d 331, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 769.\\nWe feel that we have a situation here which falls squarely within the foregoing principles, especially the one set forth in In re Kaufmann, supra. It appears to us, as it did to the Board of Appeals, that any one finding the operation of the Spangler et al. machine sluggish, could by the exercise of mechanical skill effectuate the given result of causing the stopping lever to operate more quickly by adding an additional arm and thus making it more sensitive. We must therefore sustain the rejection of the claims on Spangler et al.\\nSince the rejection on Spangler et al. must be sustained, there is ordinarily no \\u25a0 need to consider the other rejections of the claims. In re Miller, 159 F.2d 756, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 910. However, we feel-that such consideration is necessary in the present case since we do not fully agree with the rejection of the. claims on Spangler et al. in view of Cannon or Lebocey. As stated above; we feel that the claims are unpatentable over the Spangler e,t al.. patent. However, we feel that the use of Cannon and Lebocey with Spangler et al. adds nothing to the anticipatory value of Spangler et al. when used alone. The manner in which the references were combined is stated above. It can readily be seen from the descriptions that the three-armed stopping levers stop the winding machines of the secondary references only on increase in tension of the thread while the stopping lever of Spangler et al. stops the winding machine on a decrease in tension, or breakage, of the thread. Thus, there is a decided difference in operation between the machines of the secondary references as compared with the machine of the primary reference.\\nIt is well settled that prior patents may be combined to anticipate claims. In re DeLancey, 177, F.2d 377, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 760. However, one limitation . which should be . considered when references are combined is whether these references suggest doing the thing which applicant has done. In re Fri-dolph, 134 F.2d 414, 30 C.C.P.A., Patents, 939. In the present case, we feel that' the combination of references was not made in accordance with the principle of In re Fridolph, supra, which is controlling here, since there is no suggestion in any of the references which would indicate that the disclosures of the secondary references could modify Spangler et al. to give appellant\\u2019s structure and result.\\nIn our opinion, the modification of Spangler et al. as taught by the secondary references would result in a winding machine which would be caused- to stop on increased tension of the thread, and not in a machine which would be caused to stop on decrease in tension of the thread, as disclosed by appellant. We feel that this is a case where the references were put together after appellant\\u2019s' teaching was known, and that the secondary references themselves would not have suggested the modification of the Spangler et al. machine to give the machine disclosed by appellant. We ar\\u00e9 of the opinion that since the teachings of the secondary references add nothing to the teaching of Spangler et al., that this combination of references is improper and cannot be sustained even though we have found the claims to be unpatentable over the disclosure of Spangler et al. when used by itself.\\nAppellant states in his brief that the plant where appellant is employed is now completely equipped with his. improvement. This was apparently brought out for the purpose of indicating commercial success. However, this. Court may not consider the aforesaid matter which appears in appellant\\u2019s brief since it is not in the record. In re Spohn, 77 F.2d 768, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1304.\\nSince we have found the claims to be unpatentable over Spangler et al., the decision appealed from is affirmed.\\nAffirmed.\"\n",

      "            \"HAMILTON, Circuit Judge.\\nThe appellee, Knapp-Monarch Company, instituted this action against appellant, Forestek Plating & Manufacturing Company, to restrain alleged infringement of mechanical patent No. 2,040,369 issued May 12, 1936, to appellee, Knapp-Monarch Company, as assignee of William H. Fischer, patentee, and Design Patent No. 96,481 issued August 6, 1935, to appellee, assignee of Andrew S. Knapp, patentee.\\nPatent No. 2,040,369 relates to improvements on electric sandwich toaster grill and No. 96,481 to the improvement in its design.\\nAll of the claims relied on by appellee to sustain infringement of each patent were held valid and infringed by the lower court.\\nThe mechanical patent in suit is a toaster-grill consisting of three rigidly connected parts; a parallelogram tray base with peripheral upwardly and outwardly sloping flange terminating at each end into flanged handles with four depressed portions adjacent to the inside periphery of the flange serving as feet. Approximately one-half of the underneath center of the tray is pressed upwardly in parallel lines and therein is placed four slot connections with a screw in the center connecting it to the lower heating element, from which project four points fitting into the slots.\\nThe upwardly and downwardly depressed portions of the tray and lower heating element are sufficiently spaced to permit air circulation between them and its resting place to prevent excessive heat from penetrating to the table or other furniture on which the tray rests or to its handles. Resting on and attached to the tray is the lower encased heating element and it is connected to the upper heating element by a slotted pivoted pin, the slot being adjustable so the two heating elements may form a flat continuous surface to be used as a grill or closed on any thickness of sandwich, bread or other food.\\nEach of the two encased heating elements has a smooth flat surface and they are connected so the electric current flows into each at equal heat with a handle in the upper heating element for opening and closing. The whole appliance can be raised to a high temperature, without transmitting excessive heat to the tray base or its resting place and may be safely moved while in operation.\\nThe patentee points out that the object of his invention was to provide an electrical appliance of simplicity, durability and of comparatively inexpensive manufacturing cost, which could be adapted for toasting sandwiches and for grill purposes, without an objectionable amount of heat to the handles or under-surface.\\nA further object was to provide a tray support with formed feet and upwardly depressed portions which connected with downwardly depressed portions of an electric heating casing, the upwardly and downwardly projecting depressions contacting each other and being connected at contacting points, with air circulation beneath the support and the electric heating casing in such manner as to minimize heat.\\nA further object was to provide an appliance with a two-part casing, hinged together by a novel type hinge permitting the two parts to be opened for the purpose of inserting food between them or open so one point forms an extension of the other in order that two different articles of food may be cooked on each heating element at the same time. Another object was to provide a grid plate -permanently secured in a casing member with a novel type of heating element, also to provide a terminal structure, which could be assembled in minimum time.\\nAnother object was to make the heating elements free from rattling without any connecting means other than being retained between the appliance casing and the grid element when inserted in position.\\nAnother object was to provide a receptacle for catching drippings from the grids, being so arranged that the drippings would drop therein regardless of the position of the movable casing member with reference to the stationary one.\\nThe claims in suit are 1, 2, 3, 12, 14, 16 and 21.\\nAppellee contends that the art of electric toasters had been baffled in its attempts to devise one of few parts with a low base and that its assignor solved this difficulty by devising, and it manufactured, an electric toaster or grid of a new com hination with a one-piece tray-like bottom that could be assembled on the toaster casing with .three operations, and that the \\u25a0openings on the appliance for air circulation were so devised that the transmission of heat to the tray base or its handles was restricted.\\nIn determining the validity of the \\u25a0claims involved, the following legal principles are applicable: first, that the issuance of the patent is enough to show, until the contrary appears, that all of the conditions prerequisite to patentability are present and that a heavy burden rests on the assailant to show invalidity. Mumm v. Jacob E. Decker & Sons, 301 U.S. 168, 171, 57 S.Ct. 675, 81 L.Ed. 983; Adamson v. Gilliland, 242 U.S. 350, 353, 37 S.Ct. 169, 61 L.Ed. 356; second, that a new combination of elements, old in themselves, hut which produces a new and useful result or any diversity of arrangement of \\u25a0old things which introduces a new function, or a new and useful method performing the old function in a new way, support patentability, Expanded Metal Company v.

Higgins, 105 U.S. 580, 591, 26 L.Ed. 1177; third, if those skilled in the mechanical arts are working in a given field and after repeated efforts fail to discover a new and useful improvement, he who first makes the discovery has done more than the skilled mechanic in the art and has achieved patentability. Temco Electric Motor Company v. Apco Manufacturing Company, 275 U.S. 319, 48 S.Ct. 170, 72 L.Ed. 298.\\nA grill is one of the oldest cooking utensils known to our civilization. However, Garrett in his 1892 Encyclopedia of Cookery said, \\u201call good grill cooks employ tongs\\u201d and the toaster is also of ancient origin. As early as 1807 Roberts, in his patent No. 3083, described a toaster that might be extended or contracted at pleasure. A tray was described as a \\u201ckitchen utensil\\u201d as early as 1639.\\nThe advent of electricity for the operation of household appliances caused the development of the portable cooker principle in toasters, grills, casseroles, etc., and from 1933 has shown an increasing popularity. The use of a small, movable appliance permits adequate cooking with an economical expenditure of current and requires little space.\\nOne of the problems encountered in the use of these cooking appliances was the engendering of heat destructive to tables and furniture and discomfort and sometimes injury and burning to the operator in using and moving the appliance.\\nThere are a number of examples in the prior art of the use of movable electrical cooking appliances which leave the field of discovery exceedingly narrow. The references cited in the patent office and relied upon by appellant to show the state of the prior art and the lack of invention are: Weir, No. 1,574,141, issued February 23, 1926; Strauss, No. 1,764,908, issued June 17, 1930; Barnes, No. 1,804,196, issued May 5, 1931; Barnes, No. 1,866,674, issued July 12, 1932; Lucia, No. 1,873,898, issued August 23, 1932; Fagen, No. 1,-969,361, issued August 7, 1934; McArdle, No. 1,973,175, issued September 11, 1934; Nelson, No. 2,015,812, issued October 1, 1935.\\nAppellant also relies upon the following patents not cited against the application; Thornton, No. 1,161,167, issued November 23, 1915; Warner, No. 1,179,896, issued April 18, 1916; Vaughn, No. 1,-681,142, issued August 14, 1928; Wolcott, No. 1,680,402, issued August 14, 1928; Talbot, No. 1,737,620, issued December 3, 1929; Lamb, No. 1,778,263, issued October 14, 1930; Pickering, No. 1,907,441, issued May 9, 1933; Wolcott, No. 1,893,-212, issued December 4, 1934; Nelson, No. 2,015,812, issued October 1, 1935; Bole-sky, No. 2,032,106, issued February 25, 1936.\\nMost of the devices and patents have been introduced to show the development of the prior art in relation to movable cooking appliances. Appellant relies on three as best anticipating appellee\\u2019s device and as showing a lack of patentability; Barnes, 1,804,196; Pickering, 1,907,441, and Wolcott, 1,983,212. The others cited may be dismissed as not particularly germane to the inquiry and it would serve no useful purpose to discuss them. All of them in broad outline are found in the above three, and we shall confine our analysis t\\u00f3 those.\\nBarnes\\u2019 device is an electric, hollow base, cooking appliance with a lower heating element secured thereto, which in turn is secured to the upper heating element by a slot-hinge structure made up of an inwardly and downwardly curved member pivotally connected at its upper end to the top section. The lower heating element is fastened to a tray-like base, much of its area being so close to it as to act as a heat conductor. This base is provided with a plurality of feet made of separate insulating material to avoid radiation from the base to the seating place. The assembly is somewhat complex. \\u25a0\\nThe patent office considered Barnes in connection with appellee\\u2019s application and rejected it as anticipatory, which weakens it as a prior art reference here. Gulf Smokeless Coal Company v. Sutton, Steele & Steele Company, 4 Cir., 35 F.2d 433.\\nPickering devised an electric movable utensil for cooking cakes, or the like, which comprised- a pair of electrically heated hinged sections disposed side by side when in use, and superimposed on a base plate or stand. He placed insulating washers of fibre or other suitable material between the lower heating -element and the base plate. The several parts of the appliance were held securely together by screw bolts extending through the insulating washers into the lower heating element. His genius was, directed to the. improvement of the upper heating element in relation to the cooking surfaces.. No special attention was given in his application or claims to the avoidance of heat radiation frpm the lower heating element to the base, and he did not claim a tray-like support.\\nWolcott devised an electric coffee maker of the automatic, quick-cooling, vacuum type. He-stated one of the objects of his invention was to provide improved .and simplified support for the heating element effectively insulated against the transmission of heat to the base of the structure.\\nHis appliance was composed of four integrated parts. At the top was a vacuum type coffee maker in a cylindrical bowl with air holes in its sides just below the rim, mounted on a cylindrical stove of smaller diameter and attached thereto and in one part, containing a heating unit formed of sheet metal with a series of air openings around it. The stove or heating element had conical depressions in its base and was seated on a tray with corresponding raised supporting portions with air circulation between. The tray was mounted on insulating feet connected thereto by rivets or screws. This assembly was complicated.\\nWolcott\\u2019s object was to provide a means for quick cooling of his appliance upon the cessation of current flow. His air apertures caused air to flow directly onto the \\u25a0 heating element while in use and would tend to increase the use of current. His quick cooling of the appliance so it could be moved made its operation mpre expensive.\\nA summary of the prior art shows that nearly all of the elements in appellee\\u2019s device are old. The examples of prior use in the record possess some, but not all, of the elements of the patent. There is no combination shown to have existed in the prior art or use which embraces all of appellee\\u2019s.\\nThe question of invention is not without difficulty. The differences between appellee\\u2019s device and those of others seem slight, yet they are marked.\\nFischer introduced into the art a low mounted type of movable electric cooking appliance with a tray support forming an integral part of the appliance and in direct contact with it so provided that the handles and base were relatively cool while the appliance was in operation. While the elements he employed were old, his manner of making them function in combination was new. Leeds & Catlin Company v. Victor Talking Machine Company, 213 U.S. 301, 318, 29 S.Ct. 495, 53 L.Ed. 805.\\nThe presumption of patentability is strengthened by the fact that the manufacturers discarded alleged anticipating devices and accepted that described in the patent and also by the immediate acceptance and use' by the public of appellee\\u2019s appliance and the displacement of earlier ones and is indicative of invention rather than mechanical skill, where, as here, the question of patentability is narrow. Electric Machinery Mfg. Co. v. General Electric Co., 2 Cir., 88 F.2d 11.\\n\\u201cWhere the method or device satisfies an old and recognized want, invention is to be inferred, rather than the exercise of mechanical skill. For mere skill of the art would normally have been called into action.by the generally known want.\\u201d Paramount Publix Corporation v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation, 294 U.S. 464, 474, 55 S.Ct. 449, 454, 79 L.Ed. 997.\\nAppellant paid its tribute to the utility of appellee\\u2019s device by discontinuing the use of the now claimed anticipating appliances and adopting appellee\\u2019s. Diamond Rubber Co. v. Consolidated Tire Company, 220 U.S. 428, 441, 31 S.Ct. 444, 55 L.Ed. 527.\\nOne of the well-recognized rules in \\u25a0 determining patentability is the utility of a substitution. Smith & Co. v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company, 93 U.S. 486, 495, 23 L.Ed. 952.\\nThe substitutions and arrangements of Fischer accomplished more efficient action with the use of less current, cheaper construction and simpler assembly with both novelty and utility. Low v. McMaster, 3 Cir., 266 F. 518. Patent No. 2,040,369 is valid and infringed.\\nDesign Patent No. 96,481 has a single claim which reads: \\u201cThe ornamental design for a combined sandwich toaster and tray substantially as shown and described.\\u201d\\nThe design was for a novel combination of tray and toaster, low, compact, .small, smooth and neat with embossing on the tray and the top of the toaster and on the handles, the whole structural design appealing to the eye with the upper part \\u2022coming entirely down toward the base and harmonizing with it. It had the appearance of stability and long-wearing life, with a smooth curving contour, and contrasting colors of metal and black.\\nSection 4929, R.S., 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 73, the statute which authorizes the granting of a design patent, requires that the design to be inventive must be new, original and ornamental and R.S. \\u00a7 4893, 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 36, requires that the invention he sufficiently useful and important before the Commissioner is required to issue a patent therefor. Every new design of an article manufactured is not patentable. It was the intent of the Congress in the adoption of the design patent l'aw to encourage \\u25a0ornamentation and beautification in manufactured articles so as to increase their salability and satisfy the aesthetic sense \\u25a0of the purchasers.\\nThe inventive designer need not possess the skill of a great artist or sculptor, \\u25a0but he must possess more skill than the professional designer, mechanical engineer \\u25a0or metallurgist. A true standard \\u2022 to furnish a rule for the settlement of all cases in advance as to the degree of ornamentation and originality required for patentability in manufactured articles is not pos\\u25a0sible. The applicability of the Statute is ;as broad as the varying aesthetic tastes of the buying public for new things.\\nEach design must be measured at its \\u2022own particular time and in its own special field. The stream-lined train design1 was \\u2022rejected as early as 1874, but was universally accepted \\u2019 in 1934. In our own time, original work has been done outside of the official province of art. Technical progress has been made in all branches and new forms have been invented in the sphere of costume and of articles of daily use of all kinds.\\nIn handicraft, the personal touch was emphasized. The imprint of the worker and his tools was inevitable. In machine work, the impersonal prevails and if the worker leaves any tell-tale trace of his individuality in the operation, there is a flaw. The use of the machine produced a different type of designing genius. Its aesthetics required precision, calculation, flawlessness, simplicity and economy.\\nWe live in an age when the great masses of population have little to spare for luxuries which has created a demand for cheaply manufactured objects of both beauty and utility, and been a stimulant to designers. In order for one to be entitled to a design patent, his creation must be the product of inventive skill, and as in mechanical patents, there must be originality and the exercise of inventive faculty. In the mechanical field, there must be novelty and utility; in designs, there must be originality and beauty. Smith v. Whitman Saddle Company, 148 U.S. 674, 679, 13 S.Ct. 768, 37 L.Ed. 606.\\nThe combination of old forms to produce a new and ornamental design is not patentable unless the new design produces a new impression upon the eye.\\nThe shaping of manufactured articles to well-known, standardized forms does not constitute invention even though the form of ornamentation is unknown to the art to which applied if it existed in a prior, non-analogous art. O\\u2019Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 136, 14 L.Ed. 601; Smith v. Whitman Saddle Company, supra.\\n\\u201cThe design law protects a new and original design, not the thought which results in applying the design from one art to another.\\u201d Walker on Patents, Vol. 1, page 53.\\nApplying these principles and turning to prior art and uses for our guidance, Lockwood, No. 16,191, issued August 4, 1885, designed a tray having an outer, raised rim and a bottom with continuous, concentric grooves and intervening planes, with indented surfaces resembling hammering.\\nBeisel, No. 34,920, issued August 13, 1901, designed a tray of an elongated body with upstanding rims and panels at points intermediate of the rim.\\nBarchoff, No. 71,860, issued January 18, 1927, designed a serving platter with tree-like indentations in the center with limbs extending toward the rims with a deeper indentation at one end.\\nCoddington, No. 88,221, issued November 8, 1932, of which appellant is assignee, designed a toaster resting on angular feet, with half-ball soles, with upper and lower heating elements, connected by a-rod extending across the rear between the upper and lower plane into right angled hinged slot connections at each end and with angular goose-neck lifting handles at each end with an opening handle on.the upper heating element. This appliance was angular and lacked the contour and pleasing appearance of appellee\\u2019s design,\\nThe object of the design statute is to encourage the decorative arts, and a new design, if it does no more than- please the eye, is the proper subject of a design patent, regardless- of utility, even though it is a reassembling or regrouping of familiar forms and decorations.

Gropper Knitting Mills, Inc., 2 Cir., 15 F.2d 375; Graff, Washbourne & Dunn v. Webster, 2 Cir., 195 F. 522.\\nA consideration of all of the prior patents placed in the record and prior uses of similar designs,' compels the conclusion that none anticipated Knapp.\\nAppellant had been developing and placing on the market, sandwich toasters- since . 1929 and, the, fact that it abandoned its own design and adopted appellee\\u2019s in all-essential particulars is persuasive evidence that Knapp made a discovery that had escaped the draftsmen skilled'in the art.\\nThe design patent, No. 96,481, is valid and infringed.

      "            \"Johnson, Judge, delivered the opinion of the court: This is an appeal from the decision of the Board of Appeals of the United States Patent Office affirming the holding of the Primary Examiner rejecting as unpatentable claims 9 through 15 and 17, the only remaining claims in appellant\\u2019s application for a patent on a \\u201cPositive Stop Device for Winding Machines.\\u201d The appealed claims relate to a conventional thread winding machine which incorporates an improved stopping lever which causes faster stopping of the machine on breakage of the thread. The conventional thread winding machine, which has been modified, consists broadly of a tensioning device through which the thread passes from a supply source, a rotating spindle on to which the tensioned thread is wound after passing through a thread traversing and guiding device, and a stopping lever which is activated by loss in tension or breakage of the thread to stop the winding machine. Appellant\\u2019s stopping lever replaces the stopping lever of the conventional machine. This improved lever is pivoted to a portion of the machine, and has three arms mounted thereon in fixed relationship to each other. The relationship between these three arms and the remainder of the machine is as follows: Two of the arms of the stopping lever engage the portion of the thread which extends between the tension-ing device and the thread traversing and guiding device. The first of these arms is supported on the thread being wound, and the second arm (referred to as a tensioning arm) supports the thread being wound. When the tension of the thread decreases, or when it breaks, the first and second arms will drop as a unit and cause the stopping lever to which they are affixed to pivot. Thus, the third arm, because of its fixed relationship to the\"\n",

We feel that this is a case where the references were put together after appellant\\u2019s teaching was known, and that the secondary references themselves would not have suggested the modification of the Spangler et al. machine to give the machine disclosed by appellant.

This is an appeal from the decision of the Board of Appeals of the United States Patent Office affirming the holding of the Primary Examiner rejecting as unpatentable claims 9 through 15 and 17, the only remaining claims in appellant\\u2019s application for a patent on a \\u201cPositive Stop Device for Winding Machines.\\u201d The appealed claims relate to a conventional thread winding machine which incorporates an improved stopping lever which causes faster stopping of the machine on breakage of the thread. The conventional thread winding machine, which has been modified, consists broadly of a tensioning device through which the thread passes from a supply source, a rotating spindle on to which the tensioned thread is wound after passing through a thread traversing and guiding device, and a stopping lever which is activated by loss in tension or breakage of the thread to stop the winding machine. Appellant\\u2019s stopping lever replaces the stopping lever of the conventional machine. This improved lever is pivoted to a portion of the machine, and has three arms mounted thereon in fixed relationship to each other. The relationship between these three arms and the remainder of the machine is as follows: Two of the arms of the stopping lever engage the portion of the thread which extends between the tensioning device and the thread traversing and guiding device. The first of these arms is supported on the thread being wound, and the second arm (referred to as a tension-ing arm) supports the thread being wound. When the tension of the thread decreases, or when it breaks, the first and second arms will drop as a unit and cause the stopping lever to which they are affixed to pivot. Thus, the third arm, because of its fixed relationship to the oth\\\"er two arms, will also pivot\"\n",

We must therefore sustain the rejection of the claims on Spangler et al. Since the rejection on Spangler et al. must be sustained, there is ordinarily no \\u25a0 need to consider the other rejections of the claims. In re Miller, 159 F.2d 756, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 910. However, we feel-that such consideration is necessary in the present case since we do not fully agree with the rejection of the. claims on Spangler et al. in view of Cannon or Lebocey. As stated above; we feel that the claims are unpatentable over the Spangler e,t al.. patent. However, we feel that the use of Cannon and Lebocey with Spangler et al. adds nothing to the anticipatory value of Spangler et al. when used alone. The manner in which the references were combined is stated above. It can readily be seen from the descriptions that the three-armed stopping levers stop the winding machines of the secondary references only on increase in tension of the thread while the stopping lever of Spangler et al. stops the winding machine on a decrease in tension, or breakage, of the thread. Thus, there is a decided difference in operation between the machines of the secondary references as compared with the machine of the primary reference. It is well settled that prior patents may be combined to anticipate claims. In re DeLancey, 177, F.2d 377, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 760.

The appellee, Knapp-Monarch Company, instituted this action against appellant, Forestek Plating & Manufacturing Company, to restrain alleged infringement of mechanical patent No. 2,040,369 issued May 12, 1936, to appellee, Knapp-Monarch Company, as assignee of William H. Fischer, patentee, and Design Patent No. 96,481 issued August 6, 1935, to appellee, assignee of Andrew S. Knapp, patentee. Patent No. 2,040,369 relates to improvements on electric sandwich toaster grill and No. 96,481 to the improvement in its design. All of the claims relied on by appellee to sustain infringement of each patent were held valid and infringed by the lower court. The mechanical patent in suit is a toaster-grill consisting of three rigidly connected parts; a parallelogram tray base with peripheral upwardly and outwardly sloping flange terminating at each end into flanged handles with four depressed portions adjacent to the inside periphery of the flange serving as feet. Approximately one-half of the underneath center of the tray is pressed upwardly in parallel lines and therein is placed four slot connections with a screw in the center connecting it to the lower heating element, from which project four points fitting into the slots. The upwardly and downwardly depressed portions of the tray and lower heating element are sufficiently spaced to permit air circulation between them and its resting place to prevent excessive heat from penetrating to the table or other furniture on which the tray rests or to its handles. Resting on and attached to the tray is the lower encased heating element and it is connected to the upper heating element by a slotted pivoted pin, the slot being adjustable so the two heating elements may form a flat continuous surface to be used as a grill or closed on any thickness of sandwich, bread or other food.

      "            \"heat radiation frpm the lower heating element to the base, and he did not claim a tray-like support. Wolcott devised an electric coffee maker of the automatic, quick-cooling, vacuum type. He-stated one of the objects of his invention was to provide improved .and simplified support for the heating element effectively insulated against the transmission of heat to the base of the structure. His appliance was composed of four integrated parts. At the top was a vacuum type coffee maker in a cylindrical bowl with air holes in its sides just below the rim, mounted on a cylindrical stove of smaller diameter and attached thereto and in one part, containing a heating unit formed of sheet metal with a series of air openings around it. The stove or heating element had conical depressions in its base and was seated on a tray with corresponding raised supporting portions with air circulation between. The tray was mounted on insulating feet connected thereto by rivets or screws. This assembly was complicated. Wolcott\\u2019s object was to provide a means for quick cooling of his appliance upon the cessation of current flow. His air apertures caused air to flow directly onto the \\u25a0 heating element while in use and would tend to increase the use of current. His quick cooling of the appliance so it could be moved made its operation mpre expensive. A summary of the prior art shows that nearly all of the elements in appellee\\u2019s device are old. The examples of prior use in the record possess some, but not all, of the elements of the patent. There is no combination shown to have existed in the prior art or use which embraces all of appellee\\u2019s. The question of invention is not without difficulty.

Make your answer concise, and avoid redundant languages and assumptions. Below is what I have written so far:\\n\\nTUTTLE, Chief Judge.\\nThis appeal is from judgment for plaintiff-appellee in a patent infringement suit, Ibis Enterprises, Ltd. v. Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court\\u2019s findings of fact as follows:\\n1. Parties\\nPlaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.\\n2. Civil Action\\nThis is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.\\n3. Background of Patentee\\nDavid F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the \\u201cVidal\\u201d process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: \\u201chand lay-up\\u201d and \\u201cmatched die (or metal) mold\\u201d (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).\\n4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method\\nThe \\u201cVidal\\u201d process involved, in part, the \\u201chand lay-up\\u201d process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the \\u201cVidal\\u201d process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).\\n5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method\\n(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called \\u201cmatched metal mold\\u201d or \\u201cmatched die\\u201d process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).\\n(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).\\n6. Anderson Early Work and Invention\\n(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the \\u201cmatched metal mold\\u201d process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *\\n7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125\\n(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;\\n\\u201cthe depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.\\u201d (Column 2, lines 39-52).\\nThe form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).\\n(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:\\n\\u201cThe present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.\\u201d (Column 1, lines 55-65).\\n'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed \\u25a0only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim \\u25a06). * * \\u25a0*\\n11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit\\n(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).\\n(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff\\u2019s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend \\u201cPatented Process\\u201d while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs\\u2019 Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *\\nYj * * *\\n(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).\\n(b) In the Defendant\\u2019s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).\\n18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs\\u2019\\nEach of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).\\nAt this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the \\u201cclearly erroneous\\u201d limitation.\\nSecond, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of \\u201cprimary,\\u201d as opposed to \\u201cultimate\\u201d fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \\u00a7 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).\\nThird, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court\\u2019s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court\\u2019s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.\\nFourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.\\nDirecting our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson \\u2019125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the \\u201crather severe test\\u201d promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there \\u201cany unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?\\u201d Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to \\u201cscrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.\\u201d Ibid.\\nIn light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson\\u2019s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.\\nAs the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general \\u2014 problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the \\u201cclearly erroneous\\u201d limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.\\nIt is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson\\u2019s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson\\u2019s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).\\nPursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson\\u2019s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of \\u201cobviousiness\\u201d and \\u201cnewness\\u201d of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes \\u2014 both relating to the making of pre-form \\u2014 combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).\\nThe final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson\\u2019s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at\\n143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, \\u201cin that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.\\u201d (Anderson deposition at 117).\\nA discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court\\u2019s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court\\u2019s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had \\u201cabandoned\\u201d its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility\\u2019s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson\\u2019s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.\\nAlthough certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson\\u2019s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.\\nThe California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson\\u2019s case for improvement over the prior art as being \\u201climited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.\\u201d Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).\\nHaving thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson\\u2019s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention \\u2014 subjecting Anderson \\u2019125 to the \\u201crather severe test\\u201d outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson \\u2019125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of \\u201cobviousness\\u201d of the Anderson combination.\\nWhile it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus \\u201coccurred to me the moment I saw the roving.\\u201d (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or \\u201951, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson \\u2019125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson\\u2019s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson\\u2019s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).\\nFrom this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson \\u2019125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in \\u201cany unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.\\u201d Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining \\u201cobviousness\\u201d under 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve \\u2014 the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .\\nTo summarize, the Anderson \\u2019125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements \\u201cperform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.\\u201d Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that\\n\\u201cpatentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun \\u2014 a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.\\u201d\\nOur conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson \\u2019125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.\\nImplicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.\\n\",\n",

It appears to us, as it did to the Board of Appeals, that any one finding the operation of the Spangler et al. machine sluggish, could by the exercise of mechanical skill effectuate the given result of causing the stopping lever to operate more quickly by adding an additional arm and thus making it more sensitive.

As stated above; we feel that the claims are unpatentable over the Spangler e,t al.. patent.

The manner in which the references were\\n\\n219 F.2d 952\\nfinding the Spangler et al. machine sluggish, could, without a display of uncommon talent, modify the Spangler et al. machine in the manner disclosed by appellant in order to improve its stopping action. However, appellant contends that the force which causes faster stopping of his machine is not the increased gravitational action, as stated by the board, but the proper balance of the friction and tension on the additional (tension) arm. These different contentions, relating to the theory of operation of appellant\\u2019s stopping lever are, in our opinion, collateral to the basic issue of whether the improvement of the stopping lever involves invention or mechanical skill since, regardless of which theory of operation is correct, all that has been accomplished is that the existing stopping lever of a conventional machine has been made more sensitive to the thread which controls its operation. There can be no doubt that appellant has made an improvement. However, an improvement does not necessarily involve invention. In re Wilson, 150 F.2d 548, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1193.

      "            \"Johnson, Judge,\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nThis is an appeal from the decision of the Board of Appeals of the United States Patent Office affirming the holding of the Primary Examiner rejecting as unpatentable claims 9 through 15 and 17, the only remaining claims in appellant\\u2019s application for a patent on a \\u201cPositive Stop Device for Winding Machines.\\u201d\\nThe appealed claims relate to a conventional thread winding machine which incorporates an improved stopping lever which causes faster stopping of the machine on breakage of the thread. The conventional thread winding machine, which has been modified, consists broadly of a tensioning device through which the thread passes from a supply source, a rotating spindle on to which the tensioned thread is wound after passing through a thread traversing and guiding device, and a stopping lever which is activated by loss in tension or breakage of the thread to stop the winding machine. Appellant\\u2019s stopping lever replaces the stopping lever of the conventional machine. This improved lever is pivoted to a portion of the machine, and has three arms mounted thereon in fixed relationship to each other. The relationship between these three arms and the remainder of the machine is as follows: Two of the arms of the stopping lever engage the portion of the thread which extends between the tension-ing device and the thread traversing and guiding device. The first of these arms is supported on the thread being wound, and the second arm (referred to as a tensioning arm) supports the thread being wound. When the tension of the thread decreases, or when it breaks, the first and second arms will drop as a unit and cause the stopping lever to which they are affixed to pivot. Thus, the third arm, because of its fixed relationship to the other two arms, will also pivot and engage a cam which in turn causes a brake to stop the machine. It is to be noted at this point that the only difference between the stopping lever of a conventional thread winding machine and the subject matter recited in the appealed claims is the presence of the second of the above mentioned arms which is affixed to said stopping lever.\\nClaims 9,15, and 17 are considered to be representative of those appealed, and read as follows:\\n9. In a thread tension control stop member for winding machines of the type having a thread tension device, a thread guide remotely positioned therefrom, a power control device, a pivoted sector shaped latch for the power control device having a free end located between the tension device and the thread guide, a cam shaft a stepped release cam on the cam shaft and a pivoted lever system for actuating the power control device, the improvement comprising in combination a support for mounting the lever in rocking relation on the free end of the sector, a thread bar extending from said support toward the tension device for support on a thread running from the device to the thread guide, a trip leg-extending from said support into proximity to the stepped release cam, whereby rocking movement of the lever will project the free end of said trip leg into contact with the cam, and a tension arm extending generally upwardly and outwardly from said support adapted to guide the thread in an angularly disposed path running from the tension device to the thread guide, said tension arm being adapted to render effective the movement of said trip leg into contact with said cam upon release of said thread bar by breakage of thread or loss of tension therein.\\n15. In a winding machine of the type including a stop cam, a stop member adapted to be positioned in spaced relation to said cam and for movement into operative contact therewith, a thread supported member for positioning said stop member in spaced relation to said cam, the improvement comprising in combination therewith a thread supporting member to render effective the movement of said stop member into contact with said cam upon release of said thread supported member upon breakage of thread or loss of tension therein.\\n17. In a thread winding machine wherein thread passes from a tension device to a traverse device and over an arm constituted as a thread bar of a pivoted multi-arm lever system adapted to actuate means for stopping operation of said machine upon breakage of the thread or failure of the supply thereof and wherein said stopping means includes a rotating cam against which another arm constituted as a trip leg of said lever system is moved upon breakage of the thread or failure of the supply thereof and by means of which cam it is lifted to initiate stopping of the machine, the improvement wherein said lever system comprises in combination a hub portion for pivoting said system on the machine, a thread bar carried by and extending outwardly from said hub and against which the thread issuing from the tension device normally bears, a trip leg carried by and extending outwardly from said hub in angular direction with respect to said thread bar and normally out of contact with the rotating cam of the machine, and an additional arm constituted as a thread tension arm carried by and extending outwardly from said hub in a direction oppositely disposed with respect to said trip leg and at a point in the path of the thread passing from the thread bar to the traverse guide to impart sufficient additional tension to the entire lever system upon breakage of the thread to effect rapid pivoting of said lever system and movement of said trip leg into engagement with said rotating cam for actuating the stopping means.\\nThe references relied on by the Patent Office are:\\nCannon, 1,595,705, August 10,1926.\\nSpangler et al., 2,361,426, October 31,1944.\\nLeboeey (France), 558,309, May 23,1923.\\nThe Spangler et al. patent discloses a conventional thread winding machine, as described above. The only difference between this machine and the appealed claims is that it lacks the second arm (tension-ing arm) which was described above as being affixed to the stopping lever. In the Spangler et al. machine, insofar as pertinent to the claims under consideration, the stopping lever consists of two arms which are affixed to a pivoted member. The first of these arms is supported on a portion of the thread which extends between a tension-ing device and a thread traversing mechanism. If the thread breaks, or if the tension thereof decreases, the first arm will drop, thereby causing the stopping lever to pivot, which in turn causes the second arm to engage a cam which coacts with other mechanism to stop the winding machine.\\nThe Cannon patent discloses a stopping device for yarn winding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yarn exceeds a predetermined amount, the arms are caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of. increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant\\u2019s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof.\\nThe Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel. When the thread breaks (or when the tension thereof decreases), the arm drops and a linkage connected to the arm is moved to disengage the spindle of the machine. The second modification shows a system in which the machine is stopped when the tension in the thread exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this modification which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows a stopping mechanism consisting in part of three arms pivoted to a common pivot point on the machine. Boilers are affixed to two of these arms. The thread passes under one roller and over another en route from the supply reel to the take-up reel. As the tension in the portion of the thread which extends between the reels increases, at least one of the arms is caused to pivot which in turn causes the third of said arms to pivot. The third arm is mechanically linked to a latch which causes disengagement of the winding machine when the tension in the thread exceeds a predetermined amount and thereby causes said third arm to move a predetermined distance.\\nThe examiner rejected all of the claims on Spangler in view of either Cannon or Lebocey. The Board of Appeals affirmed the examiner\\u2019s rejection. In so doing, the board in essence stated that but for the additional tension arm mounted on the hub of appellant\\u2019s stop lever system, the positive stop device of appellant\\u2019s winding machine is the same as that disclosed by the Spangler et al. patent. The board further stated that upon carefully comparing the results produced by Spangler et al. and appellant\\u2019s device, the difference between the respective results is one of degree only. The board further stated that there is nothing new in taking advantage of a third arm in an armed lever system, as shown by the secondary references, for more effectively controlling stoppage of a mechanism, whether the lever system responds to an increase or decrease in tension of the thread. It is apparent from the record that the board was also of the opinion that the claims were unpatentable over Spangler et al., taken alone. The board stated that the additional tension arm of appellant\\u2019s device merely served the purpose of providing an increased gravitational action to the Spangler et al. stopping lever, and that anyone skilled in the art, finding the Spangler et al. stopping device sluggish, could modify the device so as to increase its unbalanced moment and thereby accelerate its stopping action, whether in the manner proposed by appellant or in any other way without a display of uncommon talent.\\nThus the basic issue before this Court is whether the addition of the tension arm to the Spangler et al. mechanism for the purpose of stopping the machine more quickly in case of loss of tension of the thread or breakage thereof involves invention or mechanical skill.\\n\\u2022 Since the claims on appeal recite structure which is shown to be conventional in Spangler et al. except for the above mentioned additional tension arm, we do not deem it necessary to discuss this conventional structure further, and we will confine the remainder of this decision to the above mentioned issue and to the arguments made by appellant for patentability.\\nAs stated above, the board relied on Spangler et al. alone to reject the claims. The board stated that the tension arm merely serves the purpose of providing increased gravitational action to the stopping lever of Spangler et al., and that anyone skilled in the art, finding the Spangler et al. machine sluggish, could, without a display of uncommon talent, modify the Spangler et al. machine in the manner disclosed by appellant in order to improve its stopping action. However, appellant contends that the force which causes faster stopping of his machine is not the increased gravitational action, as stated by the board, but the proper balan\\u00e9e of the friction and tension on the additional (tension) arm. These different contentions, relating to the theory of operation of appellant\\u2019s stopping lever are, in our opinion, collateral to the basic issue of whether the improvement of the stopping lever involves invention or mechanical skill since, regardless of which theory of operation is correct, all that has been accomplished is that the existing stopping lever of a conventional machine has been made more sensitive to the thread which controls its operation.\\nThere can be no doubt that appellant has made an improvement. However, an improvement does not necessarily involve invention. In re Wilson, 32 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1193, 150 F. (2d) 548, 66 USPQ 245. Improvements which are in the realm of mechanical skill do not justify patent protection. In re Jannell, 28 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1262, 120 F. (2d) 1012, 50 USPQ 51. Furthermore, it is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result. In re Kaufmann, 39 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 769, 193 F. (2d) 331, 92 USPQ 141.\\nWe feel that we have a situation here which falls squarely within the foregoing principles, especially the one set forth in In re Kaufmann, supra. It appears to us, as it did to the Board of Appeals, that anyone finding the operation of the Spangler et al. machine sluggish, could by the exercise of mechanical skill effectuate the given result of causing the stopping lever to operate more quickly by adding an additional arm and thus making it more sensitive. We must therefore sustain the rejection of the claims on Spangler et al.\\nSince the rejection on Spangler et al. must be sustained, there is ordinarily no need to consider the other rejections of the claims. In re Miller, 34 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 910, 159 F. (2d) 756, 72 USPQ 512. However, we feel that such consideration is necessary in the present case since we do not fully agree with the rejection of the claims on Spangler et al. in view of Cannon or Lebocey. As stated above, we feel that the claims are unpatentable over the Spangler et al. patent. However, we feel that the use of Cannon and Lebocey with Spangler et al. adds nothing to the anticipatory value of Spangler et al. when used alone. The manner in which, the references were combined is stated aboye. It can readily be seen from the descriptions that the three-armed stopping levers stop the winding machines of the secondary references only on increase in tension of the thread while the stopping lever of Spangler et al. stops the winding machine oh a decrease in tension, or breakage, of the thread. Thus, there is a decided difference in operation between the machines of the secondary references as compared with the machine of the primary reference.\\nIt is well settled that prior patents may be combined to anticipate claims. In re DeLancey, 37 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 760, 177 F. (2d) 377, 83 USPQ 388. However, one limitation which should be considered when references are combined is whether these references suggest doing the thing which applicant has done. In re Fridolph, 30 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 939, 134 F. (2d) 414, 57 USPQ 122. In the present case, we feel that the combination of references was not made in accordance with the principle of In re Fridolph, supra, which is controlling here, since there is no suggestion in any of the references which would indicate that the disclosures of the secondary references could modify Spangler et al. to give appellant\\u2019s structure and result.\\nIn our opinion, the modification of Spangler et al. as taught by the secondary references would result in a winding machine which would be caused to stop on increased tension of the thread, and not in a machine which would be caused to stop on decrease in tension of the thread, as disclosed by appellant. We feel that this is a case where the references were put together after appellant\\u2019s teaching was known, and that the secondary references themselves would not have suggested the modification of the Spangler et al. machine to give the machine disclosed by appellant. We are of the opinion that since the teachings of the secondary references add nothing to the teaching of Spangler et al., that this combination of references is improper and cannot be sustained even though we have found the claims to be un-patentable over the disclosure of Spangler et al. when used by itself.\\nAppellant states in his brief that the plant where appellant is employed is now completely equipped with his improvement. This was apparently brought out for the purpose of indicating commercial success. However, this Court may not consider the aforesaid matter which appears in appellant\\u2019s brief since it is not in the record. In re Spohn, 22 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1304, 77 F. (2d) 768, 25 USPQ 409.\\nSince we have found the claims to be unpatentable over Spangler et al., the decision appealed from is affirmed. \\u2022 .\"\n",

      "            \"JOHNSON, Judge.\\nThis is an appeal from the decision of the Board of Appeals of the United States Patent Office affirming the holding of the Primary Examiner rejecting as unpatentable claims 9 through 15 and 17, the only remaining claims in appellant\\u2019s application for a patent on a \\u201cPositive Stop Device for Winding Machines.\\u201d\\nThe appealed claims relate to a conventional thread winding machine which incorporates an improved stopping lever which causes faster stopping of the machine on breakage of the thread. The conventional thread winding machine, which has been modified, consists broadly of a tensioning device through which the thread passes from a supply source, a rotating spindle on to which the tensioned thread is wound after passing through a thread traversing and guiding device, and a stopping lever which is activated by loss in tension or breakage of the thread to stop the winding machine. Appellant\\u2019s stopping lever replaces the stopping lever of the conventional machine. This improved lever is pivoted to a portion of the machine, and has three arms mounted thereon in fixed relationship to each other. The relationship between these three arms and the remainder of the machine is as follows: Two of the arms of the stopping lever engage the portion of the thread which extends between the tensioning device and the thread traversing and guiding device. The first of these arms is supported on the thread being wound, and the second arm (referred to as a tension-ing arm) supports the thread being wound. When the tension of the thread decreases, or when it breaks, the first and second arms will drop as a unit and cause the stopping lever to which they are affixed to pivot. Thus, the third arm, because of its fixed relationship to the oth\\\"er two arms, will also pivot and engage a cam which in turn causes a brake to stop the machine. It is to be noted at this point that the only difference between the stopping lever of a conventional thread winding machine and the subject matter recited in the appealed claims is the presence of the second of the above mentioned arms which is affixed to said stopping lever.\\nClaims 9, 15, and 17 are considered to be representative of those appealed, and read as follows:\\n\\u201c9. In a thread tension control stop member for winding machines of the type having a thread tension device, a thread guide remotely positioned therefrom, a power control device, a pivoted sector shaped latch for the power control device having a free end located between the tension device and the thread guide, a cam shaft a stepped release cam on the cam shaft and a pivoted lever system for actuating the power control device, the improvement comprising in combination a support for mounting the lever in rocking relation on the free end of the sector, a thread bar extending from said support toward the tension device for support on a thread running from the device to the thread guide, a trip leg extending from said support into proximity to the stepped release cam, whereby rocking movement of the lever will project the free end of said trip leg into contact with the cam, and a tension arm extending generally upwardly and outwardly from said support adapted to guide the thread in an angularly disposed path running from the tension device to the thread guide, said tension arm being adapted to render effective the movement of said trip leg into contact with said cam upon release of said thread bar by breakage of thread or loss of tension therein.\\u201d\\n\\u201c15. In a winding machine of the type including a stop cam, a stop member adapted to be positioned in spaced relation to said cam and for movement into operative contact therewith, a thread supported member for positioning said stop member in spaced relation to said cam, the improvement comprising in combination therewith a thread supporting member to render effective the movement of said stop member into contact with said cam upon release of said thread supported member upon breakage of thread or loss of tension therein.\\u201d\\n\\u201c17. In a thread winding machine wherein thread passes from a tension device to a traverse device and over an arm constituted as a thread bar of a pivoted muTti-arm lever system adapted to actuate means for stopping operation of said machine upon breakage of the thread or failure of the supply thereof and wherein said stopping means includes a rotating cam against which another arm constituted as a trip leg of said lever system is moved upon breakage of the thread or failure of the supply thereof and by means of which cam it is lifted to initiate stopping of the machine, the improvement wherein said lever system comprises in combination a hub portion for pivoting said system on the machine, a thread bar carried by and extending outwardly from said hub and against which the thread issuing from the tension device normally bears, a trip leg carried by and extending outwardly from said hub in angular direction with respect to said thread bar and normally out of contact with the rotating cam of the machine, and an additional arm constituted as a thread tension arm carried by and extending outwardly from said hub \\u00edn a direction oppositely disposed with respect to said trip leg and at a point in the path of the thread passing from the thread bar to the traverse guide to impart sufficient additional tension to the entire lever system upon breakage of the thread to effect rapid pivoting of said lever system and movement of said trip leg into engagement with said rotating cam for actuating the stopping means.\\u201d\\nThe references relied on by the Patent Office are:\\nCannon 1,595,705 Aug. 10, 1926\\nSpangler et al. 2,361,426 Oct. 31, 1944\\nLebocey (France) 558,309 May 23, 1923\\nThe Spangler et al. patent discloses a conventional thread winding machine, as described above. The only difference between this machine and the appealed claims is that it lacks the second arm (tensioning arm) which was described above as being affixed to the stopping lever. In the Spangler et al. machine, insofar as pertinent to the claims under consideration, the stopping lever consists of two arms which are affixed to a pivoted member. The first of these arms is supported on a portion of the thread which extends between a tensioning device and a thread traversing mechanism. If the thread breaks, or if the tension thereof decreases, the first arm will drop, thereby causing the stopping lever to pivot, which in turn causes the second arm to engage a cam which co-acts with other mechanism to stop the winding machine.\\nThe Cannon patent discloses a stopping device for yarn winding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant\\u2019s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof.\\nThe Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel. When the thread breaks (or when the tension thereof decreases), the arm drops and a linkage connected to the arm is moved to disengage the spindle of the machine. The second modification shows a system in which the machine is stopped when the tension in the thread exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this modification which is pertinent to the claims under consid\\u00e9ration shows a stopping mechanism consisting in part of three arms pivoted to a common pivot point on the machine. Rollers are affixed to two of these arms. The thread passes under one roller and over another enroute from the 'supply reel to the take-up reel. As the tension in the portion of the thread which extends between the reels increases, \\u00a1 at least one of the arms is caused to pivot which in turn causes the third of said arms to pivot. The third arm is mechanically linked to a latch which causes disengagement of the winding machine when the tension in the thread exceeds a predetermined amount and thereby causes said third arm to move a predetermined distance.\\nThe examiner rejected all of the claims on Spangler in view of either Cannon or Lebocey. The Board of Appeals affirmed the examiner\\u2019s rejection. In so doing, the board in essence stated that but for the additional tension arm mounted on the hub of appellant\\u2019s stop lever system, the positive stop device of appellant\\u2019s winding machine is the same as that disclosed by the Spangler et al. patent. The board further stated that upon carefully comparing the results produced by Spangler et al. and appellant\\u2019s device, the difference between the respective results is one of degree only. The board further stated that there is nothing new in taking advantage of a third arm in an armed lever system, as shown by the secondary references, for more effectively controlling stoppage of a mechanism, whether the lever system responds to an increase or decrease in tension of the thread.

Fischer, patentee, and Design Patent No. 96,481 issued August 6, 1935, to appellee, assignee of Andrew S. Knapp, patentee.\\nPatent No. 2,040,369 relates to improvements on electric sandwich toaster grill and No. 96,481 to the improvement in its design.\\nAll of the claims relied on by appellee to sustain infringement of each patent were held valid and infringed by the lower court.\\nThe mechanical patent in suit is a toaster-grill consisting of three rigidly connected parts; a parallelogram tray base with peripheral upwardly and outwardly sloping flange terminating at each end into flanged handles with four depressed portions adjacent to the inside periphery of the flange serving as feet. Approximately one-half of the underneath center of the tray is pressed upwardly in parallel lines and therein is placed four slot connections with a screw in the center connecting it to the lower heating element, from which project four points fitting into the slots.\\nThe upwardly and downwardly depressed portions of the tray and lower heating element are sufficiently spaced to permit air circulation between them and its resting place to prevent excessive heat from penetrating to the table or other furniture on which the tray rests or to its handles. Resting on and attached to the tray is the lower encased heating element and it is connected to the upper heating element by a slotted pivoted pin, the slot being adjustable so the two heating elements may form a flat continuous surface to be used as a grill or closed on any thickness of sandwich, bread or other food.\\nEach of the two encased heating elements has a smooth flat surface and they are connected so the electric current flows into each at equal heat with a handle in the upper heating element for opening and closing. The whole appliance can be raised to a high temperature, without transmitting excessive heat to the tray base or its resting place and may be safely moved while in operation.\\nThe patentee points out that the object of his invention was to provide an electrical appliance of simplicity, durability and of comparatively inexpensive manufacturing cost, which could be adapted for toasting sandwiches and for grill purposes, without an objectionable amount of heat to the handles or under-surface.\\nA further object was to provide a tray support with formed feet and upwardly depressed portions which connected with downwardly depressed portions of an electric heating casing, the upwardly and downwardly projecting depressions contacting each other and being connected at contacting points, with air circulation beneath the support and the electric heating casing in such manner as to minimize heat.\\nA further object was to provide an appliance with a two-part casing, hinged together by a novel type hinge permitting the two parts to be opened for the purpose of inserting food between them or open so one point forms an extension of the other in order that two different articles of food may be cooked on each heating element at the same time. Another object was to provide a grid plate -permanently secured in a casing member with a novel type of heating element, also to provide a terminal structure, which could be assembled in minimum time.\\nAnother object was to make the heating elements free from rattling without any connecting means other than being retained between the appliance casing and the grid element when inserted in position.\\nAnother object was to provide a receptacle for catching drippings from the grids, being so arranged that the drippings would drop therein regardless of the position of the movable casing member with reference to the stationary one.\\nThe claims in suit are 1, 2, 3, 12, 14, 16 and 21.\\nAppellee contends that the art of electric toasters had been baffled in its attempts to devise one of few parts with a low base and that its assignor solved this difficulty by devising, and it manufactured, an electric toaster or grid of a new com hination with a one-piece tray-like bottom that could be assembled on the toaster casing with .three operations, and that the \\u25a0openings on the appliance for air circulation were so devised that the transmission of heat to the tray base or its handles was restricted.\\nIn determining the validity of the \\u25a0claims involved, the following legal principles are applicable: first, that the issuance of the patent is enough to show, until the contrary appears, that all of the conditions prerequisite to patentability are present and that a heavy burden rests on the assailant to show invalidity.

Higgins, 105 U.S. 580, 591, 26 L.Ed. 1177; third, if those skilled in the mechanical arts are working in a given field and after repeated efforts fail to discover a new and useful improvement, he who first makes the discovery has done more than the skilled mechanic in the art and has achieved patentability.

However, Garrett in his 1892 Encyclopedia of Cookery said, \\u201call good grill cooks employ tongs\\u201d and the toaster is also of ancient origin. As early as 1807 Roberts, in his patent No. 3083, described a toaster that might be extended or contracted at pleasure. A tray was described as a \\u201ckitchen utensil\\u201d as early as 1639.\\nThe advent of electricity for the operation of household appliances caused the development of the portable cooker principle in toasters, grills, casseroles, etc., and from 1933 has shown an increasing popularity. The use of a small, movable appliance permits adequate cooking with an economical expenditure of current and requires little space.\\nOne of the problems encountered in the use of these cooking appliances was the engendering of heat destructive to tables and furniture and discomfort and sometimes injury and burning to the operator in using and moving the appliance.\\nThere are a number of examples in the prior art of the use of movable electrical cooking appliances which leave the field of discovery exceedingly narrow. The references cited in the patent office and relied upon by appellant to show the state of the prior art and the lack of invention are: Weir, No. 1,574,141, issued February 23, 1926; Strauss, No. 1,764,908, issued June 17, 1930; Barnes, No. 1,804,196, issued May 5, 1931; Barnes, No. 1,866,674, issued July 12, 1932; Lucia, No. 1,873,898, issued August 23, 1932; Fagen, No. 1,-969,361, issued August 7, 1934; McArdle, No. 1,973,175, issued September 11, 1934; Nelson, No. 2,015,812, issued October 1, 1935.\\nAppellant also relies upon the following patents not cited against the application; Thornton, No. 1,161,167, issued November 23, 1915; Warner, No. 1,179,896, issued April 18, 1916; Vaughn, No. 1,-681,142, issued August 14, 1928; Wolcott, No. 1,680,402, issued August 14, 1928; Talbot, No. 1,737,620, issued December 3, 1929; Lamb, No. 1,778,263, issued October 14, 1930; Pickering, No. 1,907,441, issued May 9, 1933; Wolcott, No. 1,893,-212, issued December 4, 1934; Nelson, No. 2,015,812, issued October 1, 1935; Bole-sky, No. 2,032,106, issued February 25, 1936.\\nMost of the devices and patents have been introduced to show the development of the prior art in relation to movable cooking appliances. Appellant relies on three as best anticipating appellee\\u2019s device and as showing a lack of patentability; Barnes, 1,804,196; Pickering, 1,907,441, and Wolcott, 1,983,212. The others cited may be dismissed as not particularly germane to the inquiry and it would serve no useful purpose to discuss them. All of them in broad outline are found in the above three, and we shall confine our analysis t\\u00f3 those.\\nBarnes\\u2019 device is an electric, hollow base, cooking appliance with a lower heating element secured thereto, which in turn is secured to the upper heating element by a slot-hinge structure made up of an inwardly and downwardly curved member pivotally connected at its upper end to the top section. The lower heating element is fastened to a tray-like base, much of its area being so close to it as to act as a heat conductor. This base is provided with a plurality of feet made of separate insulating material to avoid radiation from the base to the seating place. The assembly is somewhat complex. \\u25a0\\nThe patent office considered Barnes in connection with appellee\\u2019s application and rejected it as anticipatory, which weakens it as a prior art reference here. Gulf Smokeless Coal Company v. Sutton, Steele & Steele Company, 4 Cir., 35 F.2d 433.\\nPickering devised an electric movable utensil for cooking cakes, or the like, which comprised- a pair of electrically heated hinged sections disposed side by side when in use, and superimposed on a base plate or stand. He placed insulating washers of fibre or other suitable material between the lower heating -element and the base plate. The several parts of the appliance were held securely together by screw bolts extending through the insulating washers into the lower heating element. His genius was, directed to the. improvement of the upper heating element in relation to the cooking surfaces.. No special attention was given in his application or claims to the avoidance of heat radiation frpm the lower heating element to the base, and he did not claim a tray-like support.\\nWolcott devised an electric coffee maker of the automatic, quick-cooling, vacuum type. He-stated one of the objects of his invention was to provide improved .and simplified support for the heating element effectively insulated against the transmission of heat to the base of the structure.\\nHis appliance was composed of four integrated parts. At the top was a vacuum type coffee maker in a cylindrical bowl with air holes in its sides just below the rim, mounted on a cylindrical stove of smaller diameter and attached thereto and in one part, containing a heating unit formed of sheet metal with a series of air openings around it. The stove or heating element had conical depressions in its base and was seated on a tray with corresponding raised supporting portions with air circulation between. The tray was mounted on insulating feet connected thereto by rivets or screws. This assembly was complicated.\\nWolcott\\u2019s object was to provide a means for quick cooling of his appliance upon the cessation of current flow. His air apertures caused air to flow directly onto the \\u25a0 heating element while in use and would tend to increase the use of current. His quick cooling of the appliance so it could be moved made its operation mpre expensive.\\nA summary of the prior art shows that nearly all of the elements in appellee\\u2019s device are old. The examples of prior use in the record possess some, but not all, of the elements of the patent. There is no combination shown to have existed in the prior art or use which embraces all of appellee\\u2019s.\\nThe question of invention is not without difficulty. The differences between appellee\\u2019s device and those of others seem slight, yet they are marked.\\nFischer introduced into the art a low mounted type of movable electric cooking appliance with a tray support forming an integral part of the appliance and in direct contact with it so provided that the handles and base were relatively cool while the appliance was in operation. While the elements he employed were old, his manner of making them function in combination was new. Leeds & Catlin Company v. Victor Talking Machine Company, 213 U.S. 301, 318, 29 S.Ct. 495, 53 L.Ed. 805.\\nThe presumption of patentability is strengthened by the fact that the manufacturers discarded alleged anticipating devices and accepted that described in the patent and also by the immediate acceptance and use' by the public of appellee\\u2019s appliance and the displacement of earlier ones and is indicative of invention rather than mechanical skill, where, as here, the question of patentability is narrow. Electric Machinery Mfg. Co. v. General Electric Co., 2 Cir., 88 F.2d 11.\\n\\u201cWhere the method or device satisfies an old and recognized want, invention is to be inferred, rather than the exercise of mechanical skill. For mere skill of the art would normally have been called into action.by the generally known want.\\u201d Paramount Publix Corporation v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation, 294 U.S. 464, 474, 55 S.Ct. 449, 454, 79 L.Ed. 997.\\nAppellant paid its tribute to the utility of appellee\\u2019s device by discontinuing the use of the now claimed anticipating appliances and adopting appellee\\u2019s. Diamond Rubber Co. v. Consolidated Tire Company, 220 U.S. 428, 441, 31 S.Ct. 444, 55 L.Ed. 527.\\nOne of the well-recognized rules in \\u25a0 determining patentability is the utility of a substitution. Smith & Co. v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company, 93 U.S. 486, 495, 23 L.Ed. 952.\\nThe substitutions and arrangements of Fischer accomplished more efficient action with the use of less current, cheaper construction and simpler assembly with both novelty and utility. Low v. McMaster, 3 Cir., 266 F. 518. Patent No. 2,040,369 is valid and infringed.\\nDesign Patent No. 96,481 has a single claim which reads: \\u201cThe ornamental design for a combined sandwich toaster and tray substantially as shown and described.\\u201d\\nThe design was for a novel combination of tray and toaster, low, compact, .small, smooth and neat with embossing on the tray and the top of the toaster and on the handles, the whole structural design appealing to the eye with the upper part \\u2022coming entirely down toward the base and harmonizing with it. It had the appearance of stability and long-wearing life, with a smooth curving contour, and contrasting colors of metal and black.\\nSection 4929, R.S., 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 73, the statute which authorizes the granting of a design patent, requires that the design to be inventive must be new, original and ornamental and R.S. \\u00a7 4893, 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 36, requires that the invention he sufficiently useful and important before the Commissioner is required to issue a patent therefor. Every new design of an article manufactured is not patentable. It was the intent of the Congress in the adoption of the design patent l'aw to encourage \\u25a0ornamentation and beautification in manufactured articles so as to increase their salability and satisfy the aesthetic sense \\u25a0of the purchasers.\\nThe inventive designer need not possess the skill of a great artist or sculptor, \\u25a0but he must possess more skill than the professional designer, mechanical engineer \\u25a0or metallurgist. A true standard \\u2022 to furnish a rule for the settlement of all cases in advance as to the degree of ornamentation and originality required for patentability in manufactured articles is not pos\\u25a0sible. The applicability of the Statute is ;as broad as the varying aesthetic tastes of the buying public for new things.\\nEach design must be measured at its \\u2022own particular time and in its own special field. The stream-lined train design1 was \\u2022rejected as early as 1874, but was universally accepted \\u2019 in 1934. In our own time, original work has been done outside of the official province of art. Technical progress has been made in all branches and new forms have been invented in the sphere of costume and of articles of daily use of all kinds.\\nIn handicraft, the personal touch was emphasized. The imprint of the worker and his tools was inevitable. In machine work, the impersonal prevails and if the worker leaves any tell-tale trace of his individuality in the operation, there is a flaw. The use of the machine produced a different type of designing genius. Its aesthetics required precision, calculation, flawlessness, simplicity and economy.\\nWe live in an age when the great masses of population have little to spare for luxuries which has created a demand for cheaply manufactured objects of both beauty and utility, and been a stimulant to designers. In order for one to be entitled to a design patent, his creation must be the product of inventive skill, and as in mechanical patents, there must be originality and the exercise of inventive faculty. In the mechanical field, there must be novelty and utility; in designs, there must be originality and beauty. Smith v. Whitman Saddle Company, 148 U.S. 674, 679, 13 S.Ct. 768, 37 L.Ed. 606.\\nThe combination of old forms to produce a new and ornamental design is not patentable unless the new design produces a new impression upon the eye.\\nThe shaping of manufactured articles to well-known, standardized forms does not constitute invention even though the form of ornamentation is unknown to the art to which applied if it existed in a prior, non-analogous art. O\\u2019Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 136, 14 L.Ed. 601; Smith v. Whitman Saddle Company, supra.\\n\\u201cThe design law protects a new and original design, not the thought which results in applying the design from one art to another.\\u201d Walker on Patents, Vol. 1, page 53.\\nApplying these principles and turning to prior art and uses for our guidance, Lockwood, No. 16,191, issued August 4, 1885, designed a tray having an outer, raised rim and a bottom with continuous, concentric grooves and intervening planes, with indented surfaces resembling hammering.\\nBeisel, No. 34,920, issued August 13, 1901, designed a tray of an elongated body with upstanding rims and panels at points intermediate of the rim.\\nBarchoff, No. 71,860, issued January 18, 1927, designed a serving platter with tree-like indentations in the center with limbs extending toward the rims with a deeper indentation at one end.\\nCoddington, No. 88,221, issued November 8, 1932, of which appellant is assignee, designed a toaster resting on angular feet, with half-ball soles, with upper and lower heating elements, connected by a-rod extending across the rear between the upper and lower plane into right angled hinged slot connections at each end and with angular goose-neck lifting handles at each end with an opening handle on.the upper heating element. This appliance was angular and lacked the contour and pleasing appearance of appellee\\u2019s design,\\nThe object of the design statute is to encourage the decorative arts, and a new design, if it does no more than- please the eye, is the proper subject of a design patent, regardless- of utility, even though it is a reassembling or regrouping of familiar forms and decorations. Protex Signal Co. v. Feniger, 6 Cir., 11 F.2d 43; Pelouze Scale & Manufacturing Co. v. American Cutlery Company, 7 Cir., 102 F. 916; Franklin Knitting Mills, Inc., v. Gropper Knitting Mills, Inc., 2 Cir., 15 F.2d 375; Graff, Washbourne & Dunn v. Webster, 2 Cir., 195 F. 522.\\nA consideration of all of the prior patents placed in the record and prior uses of similar designs,' compels the conclusion that none anticipated Knapp.\\nAppellant had been developing and placing on the market, sandwich toasters- since . 1929 and, the, fact that it abandoned its own design and adopted appellee\\u2019s in all-essential particulars is persuasive evidence that Knapp made a discovery that had escaped the draftsmen skilled'in the art.\\nThe design patent, No. 96,481, is valid and infringed.

Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court\\u2019s findings of fact as follows:\\n1. Parties\\nPlaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.\\n2. Civil Action\\nThis is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.\\n3. Background of Patentee\\nDavid F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the \\u201cVidal\\u201d process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: \\u201chand lay-up\\u201d and \\u201cmatched die (or metal) mold\\u201d (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).\\n4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method\\nThe \\u201cVidal\\u201d process involved, in part, the \\u201chand lay-up\\u201d process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the \\u201cVidal\\u201d process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).\\n5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method\\n(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called \\u201cmatched metal mold\\u201d or \\u201cmatched die\\u201d process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).\\n(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).\\n6. Anderson Early Work and Invention\\n(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the \\u201cmatched metal mold\\u201d process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *\\n7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125\\n(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;\\n\\u201cthe depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.\\u201d (Column 2, lines 39-52).\\nThe form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).\\n(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:\\n\\u201cThe present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.\\u201d (Column 1, lines 55-65).\\n'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed \\u25a0only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim \\u25a06). * * \\u25a0*\\n11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit\\n(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).\\n(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff\\u2019s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend \\u201cPatented Process\\u201d while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs\\u2019 Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *\\nYj * * *\\n(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).\\n(b) In the Defendant\\u2019s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).\\n18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs\\u2019\\nEach of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).\\nAt this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the \\u201cclearly erroneous\\u201d limitation.\\nSecond, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of \\u201cprimary,\\u201d as opposed to \\u201cultimate\\u201d fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \\u00a7 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).\\nThird, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court\\u2019s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court\\u2019s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.\\nFourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.\\nDirecting our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson \\u2019125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the \\u201crather severe test\\u201d promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there \\u201cany unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?\\u201d Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to \\u201cscrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.\\u201d Ibid.\\nIn light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson\\u2019s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.\\nAs the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general \\u2014 problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the \\u201cclearly erroneous\\u201d limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.\\nIt is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson\\u2019s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson\\u2019s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).\\nPursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson\\u2019s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of \\u201cobviousiness\\u201d and \\u201cnewness\\u201d of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes \\u2014 both relating to the making of pre-form \\u2014 combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).\\nThe final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson\\u2019s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at\\n143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, \\u201cin that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.\\u201d (Anderson deposition at 117).\\nA discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court\\u2019s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court\\u2019s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had \\u201cabandoned\\u201d its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility\\u2019s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson\\u2019s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.\\nAlthough certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson\\u2019s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.\\nThe California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson\\u2019s case for improvement over the prior art as being \\u201climited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.\\u201d Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).\\nHaving thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson\\u2019s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention \\u2014 subjecting Anderson \\u2019125 to the \\u201crather severe test\\u201d outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson \\u2019125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of \\u201cobviousness\\u201d of the Anderson combination.\\nWhile it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus \\u201coccurred to me the moment I saw the roving.\\u201d (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or \\u201951, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson \\u2019125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson\\u2019s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson\\u2019s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).\\nFrom this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson \\u2019125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in \\u201cany unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.\\u201d Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining \\u201cobviousness\\u201d under 35 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve \\u2014 the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .\\nTo summarize, the Anderson \\u2019125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements \\u201cperform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.\\u201d Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that\\n\\u201cpatentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun \\u2014 a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.\\u201d\\nOur conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson \\u2019125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.\\nImplicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.\\n\",\n",

These different contentions, relating to the theory of operation of appellant\\u2019s stopping lever are, in our opinion, collateral to the basic issue of whether the improvement of the stopping lever involves invention or mechanical skill since, regardless of which theory of operation is correct, all that has been accomplished is that the existing stopping lever of a conventional machine has been made more sensitive to the thread which controls its operation.

    "# any evidence that a member had “to modify or change his/her vacation plans due to the management’s ‘new interpretation of its rights under the vacation and management rights clauses of the labor agreement.” Arbitrator’s Decision, Slip op. at 6. In contrast, management was “vague on the specifics of not being able to meet the necessities of the supervisors and the production needs of the newspaper.” Id. The arbitrator made no further findings, but instead found that the Union’s grievance was justified. He then crafted his own solution, whereby the four new supervisors and the Union employees were thrown into a “seniority pool” for vacation selection purposes. He also provided for a grievance procedure through the Union for employees that believed they were adversely affected by the new procedure. The Beacon Journal refused to comply with the arbitration award and instead instituted this lawsuit under section 801 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185.

In March, 2001, the Company notified the Union that it would be closing its Novi plant and that it would be necessary to terminate all of the employees at the facility. As a result of the plant closing on October 17, 2001, all but one employee was terminated during the calendar year, 2001. The Company refused to pay vacationpay benefits to employees who did not work for the Company on January 1, 2002. The Union filed a grievance.\n",

    "# (a) Employees shall be eligible for vacations, time off and vacation pay as set forth below.\n",
    "# (b) For purposes of eligibility, the vacation year will be considered the calendar year period from January 1st to December 31.\n",
    "# (c) An employee covered by the agreement who is actually working on January 1st of any year and who has at least six (6) months seniority and has' worked at least eight hundred (800) hours from and after January 1st of the previous year shall be paid the equivalent of two-and-one half (2-1/2) days vacation pay.\n",

At the arbitration the Union asserted that because it was not the employees’ fault that they were unable to work the full year, the employees were entitled to their vacation pay. The arbitrator granted the grievance, allowing all plaintiffs, who, but for being laid off, would have been able to continue employment and thereby qualify for vacation benefits. The arbitrator reasoned that “[i]t would be unreasonable to cause such forfeitures particularly where an employee has no control over the situation.”\n",
