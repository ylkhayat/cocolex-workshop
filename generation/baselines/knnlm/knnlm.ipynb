      "    \"previous_text\": \"OPINION OF THE COURT\\nWEIS, Circuit Judge.\\nClaimant Merle Fowler is presently disabled by multiple sclerosis. Hampered by the necessity to establish an onset date within her coverage period, she has been unsuccessful in securing disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. Difficulties in proof abound, for the disease is a progressive one, the initial date of disability is seldom easy to determine, and periods of remission are common. And as if these problems were not enough, they were compounded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\\u2019s loss or destruction of critical records relating to claimant\\u2019s first application for benefits. After a thorough review of the case, we conclude the HEW determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966 is not supported by the evidence. Finding adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record, we remand to the Secretary for consideration of Miss Fowler\\u2019s request to reopen because of error on the record.\\nFrom the early 1950\\u2019s on, Miss Fowler worked for various medical schools as a recordkeeper, secretary, and nurse. From 1963 to 1967, she was employed at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. That institution did not participate in the Social Security program and her coverage earned while at other jobs terminated on June 30,1966. Claimant\\u2019s testimony before the administrative law judge revealed that it was during her service at U.C.L.A. that she began to encounter increasingly serious and bizarre physical disabilities. These difficulties included: problems in maintaining her balance that were severe enough to attract accusations of being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; a four-week period during which she had to crawl because of an inability to stand; slurred speech resulting in communication problems with coworkers and patients; difficulty in typing. Miss Fowler was forced to use up all of her vacation time as well as her sick leave because of her illness. Additionally, she often found it necessary to rest over long lunch hours.\\nMiss Fowler continued to cling to her employment because she was living alone and was her own sole means of support. In February 1967, her condition was such that she could no longer be retained even by the most sympathetic and understanding employer. At about this time her condition was finally diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. She then went to live with her sister in Florida, and for a period of about a year and a half was both bedridden and mentally disoriented. During this interval, her sister filed a disability claim for her with the Social Security Administration, which was rejected, according to the sister, because the claimant did not have enough quarters of coverage.\\nThe claimant enjoyed a period of remission from 1970 to 1973 when she was able to obtain limited employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but thereafter her disease was again disabling. She filed for disability benefits on March 25, 1974, alleging disability from 1965. After an initial denial, the Secretary referred her case for disability evaluation to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation. That agency, based on information that severe symptoms were observable at some time in 1965 or early 1966, concluded that a closed period of disability was established between December 31, 1965 and February 1, 1970, when remission occurred. The Secretary, however, disallowed the payment of any benefit because the 1974 claim had been filed more than twelve months after the first period of disability had ceased in 1970. See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 416(i)(2)(E). The claimant then requested a hearing, asserting that the 1968 claim filed by her sister had been erroneously denied and should be reopened. On the basis of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation disability evaluation, claimant believed she was entitled to benefits for the 1965 \\u2014 1970 period. The ALJ, however, bypassed the 1968 claim issue altogether, finding instead that there had been no disability before June 30, 1966. The Appeals Council affirmed and the district court ruled there was substantial evidence supporting the Secretary\\u2019s decision.\\nLooking first to the determination of the onset of disability, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the ALJ\\u2019s decision.\\nThe claimant\\u2019s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing. She tried desperately to hold her job and exerted extraordinary efforts to cope with her disability. Her case did not rely upon her testimony alone but was supported by several statements from persons familiar with her at that time. A letter from Justine Walker, a coworker, was received into evidence and corroborated Miss Fowler\\u2019s account of her difficulties. In addition, the detailed statements of two physicians who were aware of her condition during the period were made part of the record. Dr. Donald A. Adams, her treating physician, stated:\\n\\u201c[Bjeyond question . . . she had multiple sclerosis dating back probably to 1965 and early 1966.\\u201d\\nHe said further:\\n\\u201cwere she an employee of mine during late 1965 and early 1966 I would have had no other alternative except to terminate her due to her illness even though the consequences would have been that she would be unable to procure another job.\\u201d\\nDr. Jack A. Cannon, her employer in 1965, said that she should not have been working at that time.\\n\\u201cHowever, in considering what would happen to her if I did recommend that she be terminated, I had to realize that she would be unable to secure another position because of the problems, and that I could not recommend her for other employment based on her mental and physical condition.\\u201d\\nHer physician at the time of the hearing, Dr. Lawrence D. Ellis, came to a similar opinion after reviewing Miss Fowler\\u2019s records. He believed she was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment for a period beginning in late 1965. Moreover, the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation report, which, after careful study, found that disability existed as of December 31, 1965, was totally ignored in the ALJ\\u2019s decision. The ALJ did not refer to any of the foregoing evidence, but merely summarized the medical reports relating to the disability period prior to June 30, 1966 as giving \\u201cno indication of severe and protracted disability prior to that date.\\u201d\\nThis conclusory statement misses the mark on several counts. It fails to observe the appropriate legal standard, whether claimant is unable \\u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity,\\u201d 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 416(i)(l), 423(d)(1), and substitutes a far harsher requirement. Additionally, the statement is directly contrary to the evidence submitted by the physicians familiar with claimant\\u2019s condition. In fact, it is not supported by any medical opinion in this case. As we commented in Gober v. Matthews, 574 F.2d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1978), an ALJ is not free to set his own expertise against that of physicians who present competent medical evidence.\\nThe ALJ\\u2019s opinion drew some unsupported inferences from the fact that claimant had been employed by physicians. The ALJ commented, \\u201cit is axiomatic that physicians take care of their own.\\u201d The thrust of this remark is somewhat obscure because the record indicates the employers did take care of claimant by retaining her for a longer period than that which could be justified by her failing health. To that extent, the \\u201caxiom\\u201d tends to support Miss Fowler\\u2019s claim that she continued to work even though physically incapable of performing the tasks demanded of her. Moreover, her employment after the cut-off date does not foreclose an award of benefits since disability \\u201cturns on whether she was disabled within the meaning of the Act notwithstanding the fact that she actually did work.\\u201d Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir. 1974).\\nWe find it particularly puzzling that the ALJ ignored the findings on disability reached by the state agency to which the Secretary had referred the matter. That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ\\u2019s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.\\nAfter careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary\\u2019s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.\\nWe must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.\\n\",\n",

Wein-berger, 514 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1975), the question for the Social Security Administration on any claim for reopening is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, or whether there is manifest error in the record.

      "            \"HEANEY, Circuit Judge.\\nThelma Lauritzen argues on this appeal that her social security disability benefits were wrongfully terminated on October 22, 1965. The Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, on the other hand, argues that substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the decision to terminate. He further argues that Mrs. Lauritzen is now precluded from raising the question of improper termination because; (1) she failed to seek a timely judicial review of the final administrative decision, rendered on August 1, 1967, with respect to the October 22, 1965, termination, see 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 405(g), and that, therefore, the issues of fact litigated in that proceeding are binding; (2) she failed to request a reopening of the October 22, 1965, determination within four years of that determination, as required by 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.957(b); (3) she failed to adduce new evidence to support her claim that she was in fact disabled between October 22, 1965, and March 31, 1966, the last date on which she met the earnings requirements of the law; and (4) she failed to establish that there are errors \\u201con the face of the evidence\\u201d justifying a reopening pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.-957(c)(8).\\nWe disagree with the Secretary\\u2019s argument that substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the 1967 decision to terminate Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s benefits; and were we directly reviewing that determination, we would have no hesitancy in saying so.\\nWe also disagree with his argument that Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s failure to request judicial review of the August 1, 1967, final determination necessarily bars judicial review of the Appeals Council\\u2019s decisions.\\nMrs. Lauritzen filed a third application for reinstatement of disability benefits on December 8, 1971. In that application, she contended that she had been continuously disabled since 1964. The application was denied and then referred, on Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s request, to an administrative law judge for decision. He stated that he assumed the matter had been referred to him pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.957(c)(8). That section pro vides that an initial, revised or reconsidered determination may be reopened at any time when\\n[s]uch initial * * * determination * * * is unfavorable, in whole or in part, to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination * * * was based. (Emphasis added.)\\nThe Social Security Claims Manual defines error on the face of the evidence as follows:\\n* * * An error on the face of the evidence exists where, on the basis of all the evidence in the file on which the determination or decision was based and any evidence of record anywhere in the Administration at the time such determination or decision was made, it is clear that the determination or decision was incorrect. * * *\\nA determination or decision which was reasonable on the basis of the evidence in the file and the statute, regulations, instructions, precedents, etc., existing at the time the determination or decision was made, will not be reopened merely because there is a shift in the weight of the evidence, a different inference is now drawn from the evidence, a different rule of law would now be applied, or the statute or regulations have been amended, unless such amendment specifically provides otherwise. * * * In such cases, there is no error on the face of the evidence on which the determination or decision was based (i. e., the \\u201crecord\\u201d) which would permit reopening.\\nSocial Security Claims Manual \\u00a7 7015 (May, 1970) (Emphasis included.).\\nThe administrative law judge, after an evidentiary hearing, found that Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s disability did not cease to exist in October of 1965 but continued uninterrupted to the date of his decision in December of 1972.\\nThe Appeals Council, on review of the record, reversed the administrative law judge. It found that Mrs. Lauritzen could perform light clerical work during the period in question and that the evidence did not warrant a revision of its earlier decision to terminate Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s benefits. The Council also stated that the October 22, 1965, determination was final and binding and not subject to reopening under 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7\\u00a7 404.956 or 404.957(c).\\nThe District Court, on review, recognized the right to reopen pursuant to \\u00a7 404.957(c)(8), but stated that Mrs. Lau-ritzen had not shown that there was error on the face of the evidence. It also held that since the August 1, 1967, final decision was not subject to being reopened, it was binding under principles of administrative res judicata.\\nThe critical question is, of course, what is meant by error on the face of the evidence. The Claims Manual and judicial decisions provide the guide. The question is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, see United States v. Smith, 482 F.2d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir. 1973); Grose v. Cohen, 406 F.2d 823, 825 (4th Cir. 1969); Anderson v. Weinberger, 380 F.Supp. 640, 644 (D.Md.1974), or whether there is manifest error in the record, see Harrah v. Richardson, 446 F.2d 1, 2 (4th Cir. 1971); Easley v. Finch, 431 F.2d 1351, 1353 (4th Cir. 1970); but see Domozik v. Cohen, 413 F.2d 5 (3rd Cir. 1969).\\nOur task then is to examine the record to determine whether there was manifest injustice in terminating Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s social security disability benefits in October of 1965. We believe that there was such injustice.\\nThe record shows that Mrs. Lauritzen was steadily employed from 1942. to 1961 in various factory, office and clerical jobs. In the fall of 1963, she developed shortness of breath and chest pains when under strain or when \\u201ctrying to do something.\\u201d On April 12, 1964, she was admitted to a hospital where her condition was diagnosed as \\u201carteriosclerotic heart disease with cardiac decompensation and anterior myocardial ischemea.\\u201d She was released from the hospital on May 23, 1964. Thereafter, she made application for and was awarded disability benefits of $77.00 per month effective June, 1964, with the condition that she be reexamined in one year.\\nOn October 22, 1965, HEW notified Mrs. Lauritzen that her disability benefits would be terminated on November 30, 1965. It apparently took this action on the basis of a medical report by a HEW physician that Mrs. Lauritzen was then capable of performing light work. Mrs. Lauritzen made a timely request and was granted reconsideration of the termination decision. In the process of that reconsideration, she was given a comprehensive reevaluation by the Rehabilitation Center of Greater St. Louis. The evaluators reported as follows:\\nThe workshop evaluation and other testing revealed significant skills within the clerical and workshop assembly areas, e. g., basic arithmetic, filing, sales receipts, telephone book, language usage and assemblies, however, due to the obvious distress and discomfort (fatigue dizziness, chest pains and numerous other bodily complaints) that Mrs. Lauritzen experienced during the workshop evaluation, she could not be expected to secure or maintain a responsible gainful activity. In view of the medical evidence and her behavior during this evaluation, it is recommended that Mrs. Lauritzen seek further medical and psychiatric attention in regard to her obesity and obvious emotional difficulties (extreme fearfulness of over exertion and numerous body complaints that are not substantiated by the medical evidence). In view of these aspects which most certainly prevented her from maintaining an adequate work tolerance level, Mrs. Lauritzen could not be gainfully employed at this time. In view of her age and significant work skills she could be expected to return to gainful employment (to her previous occupational area) pending successful rehabilitative efforts. It is recommended that these services be sought through the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. (Emphasis added.)\\nPursuant to this report, Mrs. Lauritzen sought assistance from state vocational rehabilitation, but no help was forthcoming. Moreover, she made at least three attempts to return to work, but found that she was unable to hold the jobs because of pain and fatigue.\\nA heart specialist confirmed that as of September and October, 1966, Mrs. Lau-ritzen was subject to anginal pain by X-ray, electrocardiographic studies, and, in his own words, more \\u201cconvincingly by her response to nitroglycerin.\\u201d Moreover, the record shows that during the period from October, 1965, to March, 1966, Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s blood pressure was above normal, and that the medications she took included digoxin, hygro-ton, tetrasule and appetite suppressants.\\nMrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s personal physician reconfirmed his original opinion that she was unable to pursue any gainful activity on December 6, 1965, and July 27, 1966. On the latter occasion, he stated that the claimant continued to have dyspnea on exertion, difficulty in breathing and that she was subject to easy fatigue.\\nThe Hearing Examiner, who heard the matter in 1966, gave great weight to the testimony of Julia Alsberg, a vocational consultant. Ms. Alsberg testified that the claimant could perform clerical work and that such jobs were available in the St. Louis area. She based her conclusion on the written report of the HEW medical expert. She did not interview the claimant and apparently gave little weight to the thorough report of the St. Louis Vocation Center. Her conclusion that clerical jobs were available for the claimant in the St. Louis-St. Charles, Missouri, area was nothing more than speculation. All that she knew was that there were clerical openings in that area and that the claimant had clerical qualifications. As a matter of fact, Mrs. Lau-ritzen testified, without contradiction, that after she was evaluated by the St. Louis County Rehabilitation Office, she met with a representative of HEW in St. Charles, who informed her \\u201cthat there was not any kind of a job that he could find for me either after reading the report.\\u201d She also testified, without contradiction, that representatives of the Missouri State Employment Office told her that they could not find employment for her in light of her condition.\\nThe same Hearing Examiner also found that the claimant was obese and that the condition could be remedied if the claimant adhered to a proper diet. There is no evidence in the record to support this finding. The record shows clearly, rather, that Mrs. Lauritzen constantly took diet suppressants to curb her appetite, and that her calorie intake was not excessive.\\nIn summary, the only conclusion that we can reach from the record is that Mrs. Lauritzen was disabled in October of 1965, that this disability continued through March of 1966, and that it was still in effect at the time that the Hearing Examiner conducted the final hearings leading to this appeal. It follows that it would be a clear injustice to deprive her of disability insurance benefits, and that the Secretary\\u2019s decision to terminate the disability insurance benefits as of the last day of November, 1965, was clearly erroneous.\\nWe reverse and remand to the District Court with instructions to it to grant summary judgment for the plaintiff.\\n. Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s mother died at age forty-five while pregnant with \\u201ccardiac complications.\\u201d\\n. At least two of these attempts were subsequent to March, 1966. These were properly received, however, to show Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s inability to return to work during the October, 1965 \\u2014 March, 1966, period.\"\n",

The appellant admittedly is disabled, but his successive applications for benefits under the Social Security Act have been denied in a series of administrative actions marred by cler-, ical errors and incomplete evaluations. We conclude that he has not been given a full and complete hearing on the issues of past disability and eligibility for coverage under the Act. Accordingly, we vacate a denial of benefits and remand because of a record which reveals a failure to review relevant rulings and regulations.\\nPetitioner is now 49 years of age.

After discharge, he was a patient at a Veterans Administration hospital in Nashville, Tennessee from October, 1953 to July, 1954. During that stay, a portion of his right lung, one rib and part of another were removed.\\nIn the following two years he studied accounting at a business school, but on July 19, 1956 he was hospitalized for treatment of a spontaneous pneumothorax on the left.\\nMr. Coulter worked as a bookkeeper for a few months in 1957 and was employed by the post office as a substitute clerk from December of 1957 until July 1958, when he was hospitalized once more. On this occasion he received ten electroshock treatments for a schizophrenia condition, and was not discharged from the hospital until June of 1959.\\nIt was during this period that petitioner had his first contact with the Social Security Administration. On January 6, 1959, while he was receiving treatment for schizophrenia at the South Florida State Hospital, his mother filed an application for disability benefits on his behalf. On March 20, 1959 the application was denied for the stated reason that Mr. Coulter did not have enough quarters of coverage to qualify for benefits. It was discovered years later that this ruling was erroneous and that in 1959 Coulter had met the quarters of coverage test.\\nClaimant did some minimal work as a bookkeeper during a period of months in the latter part of 1959 but, according to his testimony, had to quit because of back pain. He was next employed at a drug store for some months, and in December of 1961 returned to the post office as a clerk. He stated that he received heat treatment at the post office for his back condition, and in July, 1962 was examined at the Rentz Medical Center in Miami. There he was told that, because of demineralization, his bones resembled those of an 85 or 90 year old man.\\nThe following month he was admitted to a Veterans Administration facility where x-rays showed a collapse of the sixth and an early collapse of the eleventh thoracic vertebrae. The diagnosis was idiopathic osteoporosis, a loss of bone mass. In September of 1962, Coulter resigned from the post office because of his back pain and inability to continue work.\\nIn April of 1964 he entered the Veterans Administration Hospital in Washington, D. C. and remained there for a year. During this stay, it was discovered that there was a large mass involving the first and second thoracic vertebrae, with compression of the spinal cord and accompanying paralysis. The major portion of the tumor was removed by surgery. A Veterans Administration Review Board concluded that he had had the tumor for a few years! prior to 1962, but not likely back as far as 1952 when he concluded his Army service.\\nIn 1967 Coulter fractured his hip and required surgery on two occasions, including the implantation of an artificial joint. In that same year, he underwent a surgical procedure on the fingers of his left hand.\\nAs of December, 1971 Coulter was deemed to have no function in his left hand. In November of 1972, the remainder of the tumor in the thoracic area was surgically removed at the Veterans Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He presently is 5 feet 7 inches tall, weighs 96 pounds, is emaciated, stooped, and has great difficulty in walking and using his hands. He has not had any employment since 1962. The Secretary concedes that he is presently disabled and has been for many years.\\nMr. Coulter\\u2019s contacts with the Social Security Administration have resulted in nothing but frustration. He filed a second application in 1967, but was again denied benefits because of lack of quarters of coverage. A third application was filed on December 5, 1968, listing August, 1962 as the onset of disability. After this in turn was denied, he requested reconsideration, alleging that his disability began in 1953. The Social Security Administration then determined that he met the earnings requirement until September, 30, 1960 but that his work at the post office in 1962 demonstrated an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.\\nAt Mr. Coulter\\u2019s request a hearing was held, and on May 20, 1969 the examiner on review of the evidence concluded that since the claimant had been able to earn $3,900.00 with the post office in 1962, he was not disabled as of September 30, 1960. No appeal was taken from this decision. In none of these proceedings was Mr. Coulter represented by counsel.\\nOn June 13, 1972 the claimant filed his fourth application, that presently under consideration. After a hearing, the administrative law judge concluded that administrative res judicata barred consideration of Mr. Coulter\\u2019s claim and, in the alternative, that he was not disabled in September, 1960 because of the earnings record in 1962. The appeals council affirmed the ruling on res judicata but vacated the alternative holding.\\nOn appeal to the district court, summary judgment was granted for the Secretary on the ground that there had been no abuse of discretion in refusing to reopen the claim filed in 1968.\\nUnlike many other social security cases, the question here is not whether Coulter is currently disabled \\u2014 the Secretary admits that he is. Two other issues are presented: whether Coulter has ever been accorded the full hearing to which he is entitled under the Act; and whether there has been a correct computation of the 20/40 quarter coverage requirement of \\u00a7 223(c), 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 423(c). Determination of the latter question requires an evaluation of Coulter\\u2019s disability in the 1958 \\u2014 1962 period.\\nInitially, we must meet the question of jurisdiction. A number of cases have held that a determination to invoke administrative res judicata by the Secretary is not an appealable order, e. g. Neighbors v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 511 F.2d 80 (10th Cir. 1974); Maddox v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 617 (6th Cir. 1972); Hughes v. Finch, 432 F.2d 93 (4th Cir. 1970). This court has never analyzed that issue in depth. In Phillips v. Celebrezze, 319 F.2d 530 (3d Cir. 1963), a per curiam opinion cited Hobby v. Hodges, 215 F.2d 754 (10th Cir. 1954), and affirmed a district court opinion reported at 211 F.Supp. 510 (E.D.Pa.1962). However, the district court\\u2019s decision was somewhat equivocal and appeared to be based in part on the merits of the case. In Shelton v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 428 F.2d 81 (3d Cir. 1970), the question was posed but not answered. In Davis v. Richardson, 460 F.2d 772 (3d Cir. 1972), the court stated its agreement with Filice v. Celebrezze, 319 F.2d 443 (9th Cir. 1963), but granted review under the Administrative Procedure Act to determine if the Secretary had abused his discretion in refusing to reopen the earlier claim.\\nHobby v. Hodges, supra, and Filice v. Celebrezze, supra, both stand for the proposition that in social security cases the courts do not have jurisdiction to determine if the Secretary correctly applied administrative res judicata. This panel does not agree with the cited cases and their progeny but believes that the Secretary\\u2019s action is reviewable as a final order under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 405(g). Cf. Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). However, since Davis v. Richardson, supra, holds that review under Section 10 of the A.P.A. is available, we follow that route rather than referring this case to the court in banc for reconsideration of our earlier interpretations of \\u00a7 405(g), see Third Circuit I.O.P. M(2).\\nAdministrative res judicata is a significant aid to the efficient operation of an adjudicative agency. However, strict adherence to res judicata\\u2019s restrictive effects is not particularly appropriate in an administrative setting where the claimants are generally not represented by counsel and the process is not based on adversarial concepts. See 2 Davis Administrative Law \\u00a7 18.03 (1958); Lauritzen v. Weinberger, 514 F.2d 561 (8th Cir. 1975); Grose v. Cohen,, 406 F.2d 823 (4th Cir. 1969); Annot., 14 A.L.R. Fed. 776 (1973). In recognition of these factors, the Social Security Administration promulgated regulations which in part provide:\\n\\u201cAn initial, revised, or reconsidered determination of the Administration or a decision or \\u00bfWised decision of an hearing examiner or of the Appeals Council which is otherwise final . . . may be reopened:\\n******\\n(c) At any time when:\\n******\\n(8) Such initial, revised, or reconsidered determination or decision or revised decision is unfavorable, in whole or in part, to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.\\u201d 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.957.\\nOur review of the record reveals such error as would require a reopening of the 1968 claim under the standard set by the regulations. The hearing officers\\u2019 pre-occupation with the claimant\\u2019s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider all of the applicable regulations and to overlook a number of other significant factors which would have a bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim.\\nBecause of the error of the Social Security Administration in 1959, there was no determination at that time as to whether Coulter was disabled. If a finding of disability had been made, Coulter would have become eligible for payment of benefits in 1960 when the Act was amended to eliminate the age requirement. It seems unlikely that he would have secured any employment thereafter in view of his testimony that he worked in 1961 and 1962 only out of dire need despite his pain, disability and need for treatment. At that time his only other source of income was a pension of $67 per month which he received from the Veterans Administration.\\nThe two hearing officers who heard the case after the 1968 and 1972 applications applied the current statutory test for disability. They found that the claimant\\u2019s physical condition had not lasted for a continuous period of twelve months before September 30, 1960 nor could it be expected to last for twelve months or more thereafter. This determination was based on the premise that the 1962 employment demonstrated an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity on September 30, I960.\\nWe recognize the difficulty which faces the Social Security Administration in determining the extent of a claimant\\u2019s disability as it existed some eight or twelve years before an application is filed. But the facile solution of relying almost entirely upon earnings during part of 1962 does not give the claimant the full and complete hearing to which he is entitled.\\nA social security judge acts an an examiner charged with developing the facts, Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 410, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971), and is under an affirmative duty to inquire into all the matters at issue. 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.927. As we said in Hess v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 497 F.2d 837, 840 (3d Cir. 1974):\\n\\u201cAlthough the burden is upon the claimant to prove his disability, due regard for the beneficent purposes of the legislation requires that a more tolerant standard be used in this administrative proceeding than is applicable in a typical suit in a court of record where the adversary system prevails.\\u201d\\nThe social security regulations on evaluation of earnings, 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.1532-1534, in substance provide that wages above a certain level demonstrate a lack of disability. But an exception is provided where the work activities themselves establish that the individual does not have the capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.-1534(b). The social security judge, therefore, cannot end his inquiry when a magic number on the earnings scale appears. The question still is whether the individual is disabled within the meaning of the Act. Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092 (7th Cir. 1974).\\nThe record shows that Coulter held thirteen different jobs in less than ten years. In all but two, he worked for two quarters or less. As the court said in Wilson v. Richardson, 455 F.2d 304, 307 (4th Cir. 1972), this individual\\u2019s \\u201csporadic and transitory activities may demonstrate not his ability, but his inability to engage in substantial gainful activity.\\u201d See also Shutt v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 490 F.2d 43 (5th Cir. 1974).\\nMoreover, the Social Security Administration did not consider whether employment during the period under scrutiny should be considered as a \\u201cperiod of trial work\\u201d which under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 422(c) is \\u201cdeemed not to have been rendered by such individual in determining whether his disability has ceased in a month during such period.\\u201d Since Coulter\\u2019s application for benefits had been filed in 1959, he is entitled to consideration under the \\u201ctrial work\\u201d exemption established by the Act. 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.1536.\\nSimilarly, no consideration was given to whether the claimant came under the exemption of 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.1534(a) which establishes that an individual\\u2019s earnings do not show the absence of a disability when he \\u201cis forced to discontinue his work activities after a short time because his impairment precludes continuing such activities . . . Clearly there was not a full hearing when no consideration was given to such relevant regulations.\\nWe have alluded to the difficulty in evaluating a claimant\\u2019s physical condition many years after the pertinent time. But there are ways to obtain information and the most obvious sources in this field are hospital documentations.\\nRecords were secured from the Veterans Administration covering Mr.' Coulter\\u2019s treatment before 1956 and after 1968. Curiously, none were secured for the V.A. hospital admissions of 1962 and 1964 which might be expected to yield some data helpful to determine conditions in 1960. This omission is noteworthy because Mr. Coulter, before the hearing on his 1968 application, requested in writing that the Social Security Administration secure all his V.A. records since 1953. Despite the all inclusive nature of the request, only the V.A. hospital in Miami, Florida was contacted and only as to data for treatment after 1968. Having undertaken to secure some of the records in partial compliance with the claimant\\u2019s request, the Administration should have secured all which he had authorized. Kephart v. Richardson, 505 F.2d 1085 (3d Cir. 1974).\\nThe most glaring omission in the record, however, is the failure to review records at the Jacksonville Memorial Hospital and the South Florida State Hospital where Mr. Coulter was treated in 1958-1959. These are obvious sources of information critical to the issues involved in this case.\\nWe recognize that the volume of disability claims is increasing and the strain that this has imposed upon the administrative machinery. We are also aware that the burden is on the claimant to produce the necessary evidence. Nevertheless, there must be some recognition of the difficulties under which Mr. Coulter is laboring and the fact that, but for the clerical errors of the Social Security Administration in years past, the data would have long since been assembled.\\nOn remand and after preparation of a more complete record, it is possible that a determination may be made that Mr. Coulter has been disabled within the terms of the Act for some time before\\n1960 and up to the present. If, however, the evidence does' not support such a finding, there is a further inquiry which must be made.\\n42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 423(c) reads in part as follows:\\n\\u201cFor purposes of this section\\u2014\\n(1) An individual shall be insured for disability insurance benefits in any month if\\u2014\\n******\\n(B)(i) if he had not less than twenty quarters of coverage during the forty-quarter period which ends with the quarter in which such month occurred\\n(ii) . . . For purposes of sub-paragraph (B) of this paragraph . a quarter shall'not be counted as part of any period if any part of such quarter was included in a period of disability unless such quarter was a quarter of coverage.\\u201d\\nAs the record now stands, Mr. Coulter is said to be covered only until September 30, 1960. The evidence may well establish that he was disabled for some period preceding the date of his first admission to the hospital in 1958 and extending to either the commencement of his work for the post office in late 1961 or the termination of any applicable period of trial work. If so, a recomputation of the date on which he last met the earnings requirement will be in order.\\nThe logical inconsistency in determining that a disability had not existed for twelve months before September, 1960 because of activity which occurred almost two years after that date is obvious. Only if there is evidence that there was no change in the claimant\\u2019s condition in 1958 \\u2014 1962 can such a finding be supported. None exists in this record, and the claimant\\u2019s condition in 1958-1959 when he was hospitalized for a se ries of electroshock treatments points to a contrary conclusion.\\nIn computing the forty-quarter period within which the individual must have earnings for twenty quarters, a quarter in a \\u201cperiod of disability\\u201d is not counted unless it is a quarter of coverage. The net effect of excluding any quarter of non-coverage beginning in 1958 will be to advance the date of eligibility by a corresponding three-month period. If a sufficient number of quarters of non-coverage are eliminated, even if the disability was terminated by employment at the post office in 1962, the eligibility date may be extended to cover the time when the claimant became disabled.\\nNeither the hearing in 1969 nor the one in 1972 made any findings on this point \\u2014 that is, whether the claimant could establish a \\u201cperiod of disability,\\u201d and this is so even though the hearing examiner in 1969 identified this as an issue for resolution.\\nThe Secretary\\u2019s regulation, 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.310, provides that an individual is entitled to the establishment of a \\u201cperiod of disability\\u201d if he came within the Act\\u2019s definition of disability and, as to a pre1965 application if it were filed during the period when the incapacity existed. Coulter did file his application in 1959 and, having met the requirements of the regulation, is entitled to a determination of the issue.\\nIf Mr. Coulter can prove that he was disabled within the meaning of the Act, he is entitled to a specification of the time limits of the disability. The same standards and considerations to which we have previously referred apply also to the factual determinations of a \\u201cperiod of disability.\\u201d Again, the mere fact that he worked in 1962 is not in and of itself determinative of his ability, or lack of it, to participate in substantial gainful activity in 1958, 1959, 1960 or 1961.\\nThe failure of the 1969 proceeding to make a finding on the question of a period of disability which might well bring about a different result in this case is such error on the face of the evidence as requires the Secretary to reopen the proceedings. See Baerga v. Richardson, 500 F.2d 309 (3d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 931, 95 S.Ct. 1133, 43 L.Ed.2d 403 (1975). Moreover, the failure to apply the relevant standards for determination of disability in the unusual circumstance of this case also mandates a reconsideration. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be vacated so that it can remand this matter to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n. In 1959 a disabled worker under the age of 50 was not entitled to receive monetary payments. However, he was entitled to the benefits of a \\u201cdisability freeze\\u201d which would preserve his insured status even though he was not working during the period of incapacity. The fifty year age requirement was eliminated by the Social Security Act amendments of 1960. See 1960 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin. News, p. 3622.\\n. Because he was under the Civil Service System during this particular period, he received no credits toward Social Security eligibility. In 1958, because he was in a temporary employee status, the post office did allow credit for Social Security benefits.\\n. Idiopathic osteoporosis is a spontaneous \\u201cabnormal rarefaction of bone, seen most commonly in the elderly. Depending on the extent of demineralization of bone, it may be accompanied by pain, particularly of the lower back; deformities, such as loss of stature; and pathological fractures.\\u201d \\u2022 Dorland\\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary (25th ed. 1974).\\n. Once again the Social Security Administration erroneously computed the quarters of coverage. In a letter dated September 15, 1972 it said that Coulter last met the earnings requirement on January 30, 1956, despite the fact that in 1968 the critical date was determined on reconsideration to be September 30, 1960.\\n. See the discussion by Judge Gewin in Ortego v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1005 (5th Cir. 1975), and Judge Friendly\\u2019s opinion in Cappadora v. Celebrezze, 356 F.2d 1 (2d Cir. 1966).\\n. In the 1967 amendments to \\u00a7 223, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 423, Congress provided that earnings above a certain amount designated by the Secretary would establish that the claimant was able to perform substantial gainful activity. 1967 U.S. Code Cong, and Admin.News, pp. 2880-83. See Harris v. Richardson, 450 F.2d 1099 (4th Cir. 1971). Section 158(e) of Pub.L. 90-248 provided that the amendment would apply to all applications filed in or after January, 1968.\\n. Coulter had accumulated 20 quarters of coverage before he was hospitalized in 1958. But his working history both before and after 1958 is so sporadic that the appropriate umbrella of 40 quarters takes him only as far as September of 1960. Eliminating quarters when he did not earn coverage will extend the period within which he may apply the 20 covered quarters.\\n. Even at the expense of prolonging an already lengthy opinion, it seems appropriate to quote from Justice Douglas\\u2019 dissent in Richardson v. Perales, supra 402 U.S. at 413, 91 S.Ct. at 1433:\\n\\u201cThis case is minuscule in relation to the staggering problems of the Nation. But when a grave injustice is wreaked on an individual by the presently powerful federal bureaucracy, it is a matter of concern to everyone, for these days the average man can say: \\u2018There but for the- grace of God go I.\\u2019 \\u201d\"\n",

      "            \"HEANEY, Circuit Judge. Thelma Lauritzen argues on this appeal that her social security disability benefits were wrongfully terminated on October 22, 1965. The Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, on the other hand, argues that substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the decision to terminate. He further argues that Mrs. Lauritzen is now precluded from raising the question of improper termination because; (1) she failed to seek a timely judicial review of the final administrative decision, rendered on August 1, 1967, with respect to the October 22, 1965, termination, see 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 405(g), and that, therefore, the issues of fact litigated in that proceeding are binding; (2) she failed to request a reopening of the October 22, 1965, determination within four years of that determination, as required by 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.957(b); (3) she failed to adduce new evidence to support her claim that she was in fact disabled between October 22, 1965, and March 31, 1966, the last date on which she met the earnings requirements of the law; and (4) she failed to establish that there are errors \\u201con the face of the evidence\\u201d justifying a reopening pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.-957(c)(8). We disagree with the Secretary\\u2019s argument that substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the 1967 decision to terminate Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s benefits; and were we directly reviewing that determination, we would have no hesitancy in saying so. We also disagree with his argument that Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s failure to request judicial review of the August 1, 1967, final determination necessarily bars judicial review of the Appeals Council\\u2019s decisions. Mrs. Lauritzen filed a third application for reinstatement of disability benefits on December 8, 1971. In that application, she contended that she had been continuously disabled since 1964.

The appellant admittedly is disabled, but his successive applications for benefits under the Social Security Act have been denied in a series of administrative actions marred by cler-, ical errors and incomplete evaluations. We conclude that he has not been given a full and complete hearing on the issues of past disability and eligibility for coverage under the Act. Accordingly, we vacate a denial of benefits and remand because of a record which reveals a failure to review relevant rulings and regulations. Petitioner is now 49 years of age. In that span of years he has had more than his share of physical ailments and disabilities. While in the United States Army in 1952, he contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalized as a result. After discharge, he was a patient at a Veterans Administration hospital in Nashville, Tennessee from October, 1953 to July, 1954. During that stay, a portion of his right lung, one rib and part of another were removed. In the following two years he studied accounting at a business school, but on July 19, 1956 he was hospitalized for treatment of a spontaneous pneumothorax on the left. Mr. Coulter worked as a bookkeeper for a few months in 1957 and was employed by the post office as a substitute clerk from December of 1957 until July 1958, when he was hospitalized once more. On this occasion he received ten electroshock treatments for a schizophrenia condition, and was not discharged from the hospital until June of 1959. It was during this period that petitioner had his first contact with the Social Security Administration. On January 6, 1959, while he was receiving treatment for schizophrenia\"\n",

After a hearing, the administrative law judge concluded that administrative res judicata barred consideration of Mr. Coulter\\u2019s claim and, in the alternative, that he was not disabled in September, 1960 because of the earnings record in 1962.

Only if there is evidence that there was no change in the claimant\\u2019s condition in 1958 \\u2014 1962 can such a finding be supported. None exists in this record, and the claimant\\u2019s condition in 1958-1959 when he was hospitalized for a se ries of electroshock treatments points to a contrary conclusion. In computing the forty-quarter period within which the individual must have earnings for twenty quarters, a quarter in a \\u201cperiod of disability\\u201d is not counted unless it is a quarter of coverage. The net effect of excluding any quarter of non-coverage beginning in 1958 will be to advance the date of eligibility by a corresponding three-month period. If a sufficient number of quarters of non-coverage are eliminated, even if the disability was terminated by employment at the post office in 1962, the eligibility date may be extended to cover the time when the claimant became disabled. Neither the hearing in 1969 nor the one in 1972 made any findings on this point \\u2014 that is, whether the claimant could establish a \\u201cperiod of disability,\\u201d and this is so even though the hearing examiner in 1969 identified this as an issue for resolution. The Secretary\\u2019s regulation, 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.310, provides that an individual is entitled to the establishment of a \\u201cperiod of disability\\u201d if he came within the Act\\u2019s definition of disability and, as to a pre1965 application if it were filed during\"\n",

The hearing officers\\u2019 pre-occupation with the claimant\\u2019s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider all of the applicable regulations and to overlook a number of other significant factors which would have a bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim. Because of the error of the Social Security Administration in 1959, there was no determination at that time as to whether Coulter was disabled. If a finding of disability had been made, Coulter would have become eligible for payment of benefits in 1960 when the Act was amended to eliminate the age requirement. It seems unlikely that he would have secured any employment thereafter in view of his testimony that he worked in 1961 and 1962 only out of dire need despite his pain, disability and need for treatment. At that time his only other source of income was a pension of $67 per month which he received from the Veterans Administration. The two hearing officers who heard the case after the 1968 and 1972 applications applied the current statutory test for disability. They found that the claimant\\u2019s\",\n",

We also disagree with his argument that Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s failure to request judicial review of the August 1, 1967, final determination necessarily bars judicial review of the Appeals Council\\u2019s decisions.

After a hearing, the administrative law judge concluded that administrative res judicata barred consideration of Mr. Coulter\\u2019s claim and, in the alternative, that he was not disabled in September, 1960 because of the earnings record in 1962. The appeals council affirmed the ruling on res judicata but vacated the alternative holding. On appeal to the district court, summary judgment was granted for the Secretary on the ground that there had been no abuse of discretion in refusing to reopen the claim filed in 1968. Unlike many other social security cases, the question here is not whether Coulter is currently disabled \\u2014 the Secretary admits that he is. Two other issues are presented: whether Coulter has ever been accorded the full hearing to which he is entitled under the Act; and whether there has been a correct computation of the 20/40 quarter coverage requirement of \\u00a7 223(c), 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 423(c). Determination of the latter question requires an evaluation of Coulter\\u2019s disability in the 1958 \\u2014 1962 period. Initially, we must meet the question of jurisdiction. A number of cases have held that a determination to invoke administrative res judicata by the Secretary is not an appealable order, e. g. Neighbors v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 511 F.2d 80 (10th Cir. 1974); Maddox v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 617 (6th Cir. 1972); Hughes v. Finch, 432 F.2d 93 (4th Cir. 1970). This court has never analyzed that issue in depth. In Phillips v. Celebrezze, 319 F.2d 530 (3d Cir. 1963), a per curiam opinion cited Hobby v. Hodges, 215 F.2d 754 (10th Cir. 1954), and affirmed a district court opinion reported at 211 F.Supp. 510 (E.D.Pa.1962). However, the district court\\u2019s decision was somewhat equivocal and\",\n",

The Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, on the other hand, argues that substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the decision to terminate. He further argues that Mrs. Lauritzen is now precluded from raising the question of improper termination because; (1) she failed to seek a timely judicial review of the final administrative decision, rendered on August 1, 1967, with respect to the October 22, 1965, termination, see 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 405(g), and that, therefore, the issues of fact litigated in that proceeding are binding; (2) she failed to request a reopening of the October 22, 1965, determination within four years of that determination, as required by 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.957(b); (3) she failed to adduce new evidence to support her claim that she was in fact disabled between October 22, 1965, and March 31, 1966, the last date on which she met the earnings requirements of the law; and (4) she failed to establish that there are errors \\u201con the face of the evidence\\u201d justifying a reopening pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.-957(c)(8).

We also disagree with his argument that Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s failure to request judicial review of the August 1, 1967, final determination necessarily bars judicial review of the Appeals Council\\u2019s decisions.

      "    \"prompt\": \"<s>[INST] Continue to write the following case in the style of my writeup. Your answer should range from 100 to 400 words. Make your answer concise, and avoid redundant languages and assumptions. Below is what I have written so far:\\n\\nOPINION OF THE COURT\\nWEIS, Circuit Judge.\\nClaimant Merle Fowler is presently disabled by multiple sclerosis. Hampered by the necessity to establish an onset date within her coverage period, she has been unsuccessful in securing disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. Difficulties in proof abound, for the disease is a progressive one, the initial date of disability is seldom easy to determine, and periods of remission are common. And as if these problems were not enough, they were compounded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\\u2019s loss or destruction of critical records relating to claimant\\u2019s first application for benefits. After a thorough review of the case, we conclude the HEW determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966 is not supported by the evidence. Finding adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record, we remand to the Secretary for consideration of Miss Fowler\\u2019s request to reopen because of error on the record.\\nFrom the early 1950\\u2019s on, Miss Fowler worked for various medical schools as a recordkeeper, secretary, and nurse. From 1963 to 1967, she was employed at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. That institution did not participate in the Social Security program and her coverage earned while at other jobs terminated on June 30,1966. Claimant\\u2019s testimony before the administrative law judge revealed that it was during her service at U.C.L.A. that she began to encounter increasingly serious and bizarre physical disabilities. These difficulties included: problems in maintaining her balance that were severe enough to attract accusations of being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; a four-week period during which she had to crawl because of an inability to stand; slurred speech resulting in communication problems with coworkers and patients; difficulty in typing. Miss Fowler was forced to use up all of her vacation time as well as her sick leave because of her illness. Additionally, she often found it necessary to rest over long lunch hours.\\nMiss Fowler continued to cling to her employment because she was living alone and was her own sole means of support. In February 1967, her condition was such that she could no longer be retained even by the most sympathetic and understanding employer. At about this time her condition was finally diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. She then went to live with her sister in Florida, and for a period of about a year and a half was both bedridden and mentally disoriented. During this interval, her sister filed a disability claim for her with the Social Security Administration, which was rejected, according to the sister, because the claimant did not have enough quarters of coverage.\\nThe claimant enjoyed a period of remission from 1970 to 1973 when she was able to obtain limited employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but thereafter her disease was again disabling. She filed for disability benefits on March 25, 1974, alleging disability from 1965. After an initial denial, the Secretary referred her case for disability evaluation to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation. That agency, based on information that severe symptoms were observable at some time in 1965 or early 1966, concluded that a closed period of disability was established between December 31, 1965 and February 1, 1970, when remission occurred. The Secretary, however, disallowed the payment of any benefit because the 1974 claim had been filed more than twelve months after the first period of disability had ceased in 1970. See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 416(i)(2)(E). The claimant then requested a hearing, asserting that the 1968 claim filed by her sister had been erroneously denied and should be reopened. On the basis of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation disability evaluation, claimant believed she was entitled to benefits for the 1965 \\u2014 1970 period. The ALJ, however, bypassed the 1968 claim issue altogether, finding instead that there had been no disability before June 30, 1966. The Appeals Council affirmed and the district court ruled there was substantial evidence supporting the Secretary\\u2019s decision.\\nLooking first to the determination of the onset of disability, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the ALJ\\u2019s decision.\\nThe claimant\\u2019s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing. She tried desperately to hold her job and exerted extraordinary efforts to cope with her disability. Her case did not rely upon her testimony alone but was supported by several statements from persons familiar with her at that time. A letter from Justine Walker, a coworker, was received into evidence and corroborated Miss Fowler\\u2019s account of her difficulties. In addition, the detailed statements of two physicians who were aware of her condition during the period were made part of the record. Dr. Donald A. Adams, her treating physician, stated:\\n\\u201c[Bjeyond question . . . she had multiple sclerosis dating back probably to 1965 and early 1966.\\u201d\\nHe said further:\\n\\u201cwere she an employee of mine during late 1965 and early 1966 I would have had no other alternative except to terminate her due to her illness even though the consequences would have been that she would be unable to procure another job.\\u201d\\nDr. Jack A. Cannon, her employer in 1965, said that she should not have been working at that time.\\n\\u201cHowever, in considering what would happen to her if I did recommend that she be terminated, I had to realize that she would be unable to secure another position because of the problems, and that I could not recommend her for other employment based on her mental and physical condition.\\u201d\\nHer physician at the time of the hearing, Dr. Lawrence D. Ellis, came to a similar opinion after reviewing Miss Fowler\\u2019s records. He believed she was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment for a period beginning in late 1965. Moreover, the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation report, which, after careful study, found that disability existed as of December 31, 1965, was totally ignored in the ALJ\\u2019s decision. The ALJ did not refer to any of the foregoing evidence, but merely summarized the medical reports relating to the disability period prior to June 30, 1966 as giving \\u201cno indication of severe and protracted disability prior to that date.\\u201d\\nThis conclusory statement misses the mark on several counts. It fails to observe the appropriate legal standard, whether claimant is unable \\u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity,\\u201d 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 416(i)(l), 423(d)(1), and substitutes a far harsher requirement. Additionally, the statement is directly contrary to the evidence submitted by the physicians familiar with claimant\\u2019s condition. In fact, it is not supported by any medical opinion in this case. As we commented in Gober v. Matthews, 574 F.2d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1978), an ALJ is not free to set his own expertise against that of physicians who present competent medical evidence.\\nThe ALJ\\u2019s opinion drew some unsupported inferences from the fact that claimant had been employed by physicians. The ALJ commented, \\u201cit is axiomatic that physicians take care of their own.\\u201d The thrust of this remark is somewhat obscure because the record indicates the employers did take care of claimant by retaining her for a longer period than that which could be justified by her failing health. To that extent, the \\u201caxiom\\u201d tends to support Miss Fowler\\u2019s claim that she continued to work even though physically incapable of performing the tasks demanded of her. Moreover, her employment after the cut-off date does not foreclose an award of benefits since disability \\u201cturns on whether she was disabled within the meaning of the Act notwithstanding the fact that she actually did work.\\u201d Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir. 1974).\\nWe find it particularly puzzling that the ALJ ignored the findings on disability reached by the state agency to which the Secretary had referred the matter. That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ\\u2019s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.\\nAfter careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary\\u2019s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.\\nWe must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.\\n [/INST]\",\n",

The Appeals Council, on review of the record, reversed the administrative law judge. It found that Mrs. Lauritzen could perform light clerical work during the period in question and that the evidence did not warrant a revision of its earlier decision to terminate Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s benefits. The Council also stated that the October 22, 1965, determination was final and binding and not subject to reopening under 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7\\u00a7 404.956 or 404.957(c). The District Court, on review, recognized the right to reopen pursuant to \\u00a7 404.957(c)(8), but stated that Mrs. Lau-ritzen had not shown that there was error on the face of the evidence. It also held that since the August 1, 1967, final decision was not subject to being reopened, it was binding under principles of administrative res judicata. The critical question is, of course, what is meant by error on the face of the evidence. The Claims Manual and judicial decisions provide the guide. The question is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, see United States v. Smith, 482 F.2d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir. 1973); Grose v. Cohen, 406 F.2d 823, 825 (4th Cir. 1969); Anderson v. Weinberger, 380 F.Supp. 640, 644 (D.Md.1974), or whether there is manifest error in the record, see Harrah v. Richardson, 446 F.2d 1, 2 (4th Cir. 1971); Easley v. Finch, 431 F.2d 1351, 1353 (4th Cir. 1970); but see Domozik v. Cohen, 413 F.2d 5 (3rd Cir. 1969). Our task then is to examine the record to determine whether there was manifest injustice in terminating Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s social security disability benefits in October of 1965. We\\n\\n527 F.2d 224\\nSalfi, 422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). However, since Davis v. Richardson, supra, holds that review under Section 10 of the A.P.A. is available, we follow that route rather than referring this case to the court in banc for reconsideration of our earlier interpretations of \\u00a7 405(g), see Third Circuit I.O.P. M(2). Administrative res judicata is a significant aid to the efficient operation of an adjudicative agency. However, strict adherence to res judicata\\u2019s restrictive effects is not particularly appropriate in an administrative setting where the claimants are generally not represented by counsel and the process is not based on adversarial concepts. See 2 Davis Administrative Law \\u00a7 18.03 (1958); Lauritzen v. Weinberger, 514 F.2d 561 (8th Cir. 1975); Grose v. Cohen,, 406 F.2d 823 (4th Cir. 1969); Annot., 14 A.L.R. Fed. 776 (1973). In recognition of these factors, the Social Security Administration promulgated regulations which in part provide: \\u201cAn initial, revised, or reconsidered determination of the Administration or a decision or \\u00bfWised decision of an hearing examiner or of the Appeals Council which is otherwise final . . . may be reopened: ****** (c) At any time when: ****** (8) Such initial, revised, or reconsidered determination or decision or revised decision is unfavorable, in whole or in part, to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.\\u201d 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.957. Our review of the record reveals such error as would require a reopening of the 1968 claim under the standard set by the regulations. The hearing officers\\u2019 pre-occupation with the claimant\\u2019s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider all of the applicable regulations and to overlook a number of other significant factors\\n\\n514 F.2d 561\\nsubject to being reopened, it was binding under principles of administrative res judicata. The critical question is, of course, what is meant by error on the face of the evidence. The Claims Manual and judicial decisions provide the guide. The question is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, see United States v. Smith, 482 F.2d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir. 1973); Grose v. Cohen, 406 F.2d 823, 825 (4th Cir. 1969); Anderson v. Weinberger, 380 F.Supp. 640, 644 (D.Md.1974), or whether there is manifest error in the record, see Harrah v. Richardson, 446 F.2d 1, 2 (4th Cir. 1971); Easley v. Finch, 431 F.2d 1351, 1353 (4th Cir. 1970); but see Domozik v. Cohen, 413 F.2d 5 (3rd Cir. 1969). Our task then is to examine the record to determine whether there was manifest injustice in terminating Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s social security disability benefits in October of 1965. We believe that there was such injustice. The record shows that Mrs. Lauritzen was steadily employed from 1942. to 1961 in various factory, office and clerical jobs. In the fall of 1963, she developed shortness of breath and chest pains when under strain or when \\u201ctrying to do something.\\u201d On April 12, 1964, she was admitted to a hospital where her condition was diagnosed as \\u201carteriosclerotic heart disease with cardiac decompensation and anterior myocardial ischemea.\\u201d She was released from the hospital on May 23, 1964. Thereafter, she made application for and was awarded disability benefits of $77.00 per month effective June, 1964, with the condition that she be reexamined in one year. On October 22, 1965, HEW notified Mrs. Lauritzen that her disability benefits would be terminated on November 30, 1965.

Cohen, 406 F.2d 823, 825 (4th Cir. 1969); Anderson v. Weinberger, 380 F.Supp. 640, 644 (D.Md.1974), or whether there is manifest error in the record, see Harrah v.

It apparently took this action on the basis of a medical report by a HEW physician that Mrs. Lauritzen was then capable of performing light work. Mrs. Lauritzen made a timely request and was granted reconsideration of the termination decision. In the process of that reconsideration, she was given a comprehensive reevaluation by the Rehabilitation Center of Greater St. Louis. The evaluators reported as follows:\\nThe workshop evaluation and other testing revealed significant skills within the clerical and workshop assembly areas, e. g., basic arithmetic, filing, sales receipts, telephone book, language usage and assemblies, however, due to the obvious distress and discomfort (fatigue dizziness, chest pains and numerous other bodily complaints) that Mrs. Lauritzen experienced during the workshop evaluation, she could not be expected to secure or maintain a responsible gainful activity. In view of the medical evidence and her behavior during this evaluation, it is recommended that Mrs. Lauritzen seek further medical and psychiatric attention in regard to her obesity and obvious emotional difficulties (extreme fearfulness of over exertion and numerous body complaints that are not substantiated by the medical evidence). In view of these aspects which most certainly prevented her from maintaining an adequate work tolerance level, Mrs. Lauritzen could not be gainfully employed at this time. In view of her age and significant work skills she could be expected to return to gainful employment (to her previous occupational area) pending successful rehabilitative efforts. It is recommended that these services be sought through the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. (Emphasis added.)\\nPursuant to this report, Mrs. Lauritzen sought assistance from state vocational rehabilitation, but no help was forthcoming. Moreover, she made at least three attempts to return to work, but found that she was unable to hold the jobs because of pain and fatigue.\\nA heart specialist confirmed that as of September and October, 1966, Mrs. Lau-ritzen was subject to anginal pain by X-ray, electrocardiographic studies, and, in his own words, more \\u201cconvincingly by her response to nitroglycerin.\\u201d Moreover, the record shows that during the period from October, 1965, to March, 1966, Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s blood pressure was above normal, and that the medications she took included digoxin, hygro-ton, tetrasule and appetite suppressants.\\nMrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s personal physician reconfirmed his original opinion that she was unable to pursue any gainful activity on December 6, 1965, and July 27, 1966. On the latter occasion, he stated that the claimant continued to have dyspnea on exertion, difficulty in breathing and that she was subject to easy fatigue.\\nThe Hearing Examiner, who heard the matter in 1966, gave great weight to the testimony of Julia Alsberg, a vocational consultant. Ms. Alsberg testified that the claimant could perform clerical work and that such jobs were available in the St. Louis area. She based her conclusion on the written report of the HEW medical expert. She did not interview the claimant and apparently gave little weight to the thorough report of the St. Louis Vocation Center. Her conclusion that clerical jobs were available for the claimant in the St. Louis-St. Charles, Missouri, area was nothing more than speculation. All that she knew was that there were clerical openings in that area and that the claimant had clerical qualifications. As a matter of fact, Mrs. Lau-ritzen testified, without contradiction, that after she was evaluated by the St. Louis County Rehabilitation Office, she met with a representative of HEW in St. Charles, who informed her \\u201cthat there was not any kind of a job that he could find for me either after reading the report.\\u201d She also testified, without contradiction, that representatives of the Missouri State Employment Office told her that they could not find employment for her in light of her condition.\\nThe same Hearing Examiner also found that the claimant was obese and that the condition could be remedied if the claimant adhered to a proper diet. There is no evidence in the record to support this finding. The record shows clearly, rather, that Mrs. Lauritzen constantly took diet suppressants to curb her appetite, and that her calorie intake was not excessive.\\nIn summary, the only conclusion that we can reach from the record is that Mrs. Lauritzen was disabled in October of 1965, that this disability continued through March of 1966, and that it was still in effect at the time that the Hearing Examiner conducted the final hearings leading to this appeal. It follows that it would be a clear injustice to deprive her of disability insurance benefits, and that the Secretary\\u2019s decision to terminate the disability insurance benefits as of the last day of November, 1965, was clearly erroneous.\\nWe reverse and remand to the District Court with instructions to it to grant summary judgment for the plaintiff.\\n. Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s mother died at age forty-five while pregnant with \\u201ccardiac complications.\\u201d\\n. At least two of these attempts were subsequent to March, 1966. These were properly received, however, to show Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s inability to return to work during the October, 1965 \\u2014 March, 1966, period.\"\n",

      "            \"OPINION OF THE COURT\\nWEIS, Circuit Judge.\\nOne man\\u2019s frustrating struggle in the toils of federal red tape forms the back drop for this appeal. The appellant admittedly is disabled, but his successive applications for benefits under the Social Security Act have been denied in a series of administrative actions marred by cler-, ical errors and incomplete evaluations. We conclude that he has not been given a full and complete hearing on the issues of past disability and eligibility for coverage under the Act. Accordingly, we vacate a denial of benefits and remand because of a record which reveals a failure to review relevant rulings and regulations.\\nPetitioner is now 49 years of age. In that span of years he has had more than his share of physical ailments and disabilities. While in the United States Army in 1952, he contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalized as a result. After discharge, he was a patient at a Veterans Administration hospital in Nashville, Tennessee from October, 1953 to July, 1954. During that stay, a portion of his right lung, one rib and part of another were removed.\\nIn the following two years he studied accounting at a business school, but on July 19, 1956 he was hospitalized for treatment of a spontaneous pneumothorax on the left.\\nMr. Coulter worked as a bookkeeper for a few months in 1957 and was employed by the post office as a substitute clerk from December of 1957 until July 1958, when he was hospitalized once more. On this occasion he received ten electroshock treatments for a schizophrenia condition, and was not discharged from the hospital until June of 1959.\\nIt was during this period that petitioner had his first contact with the Social Security Administration. On January 6, 1959, while he was receiving treatment for schizophrenia at the South Florida State Hospital, his mother filed an application for disability benefits on his behalf. On March 20, 1959 the application was denied for the stated reason that Mr. Coulter did not have enough quarters of coverage to qualify for benefits. It was discovered years later that this ruling was erroneous and that in 1959 Coulter had met the quarters of coverage test.\\nClaimant did some minimal work as a bookkeeper during a period of months in the latter part of 1959 but, according to his testimony, had to quit because of back pain. He was next employed at a drug store for some months, and in December of 1961 returned to the post office as a clerk. He stated that he received heat treatment at the post office for his back condition, and in July, 1962 was examined at the Rentz Medical Center in Miami. There he was told that, because of demineralization, his bones resembled those of an 85 or 90 year old man.\\nThe following month he was admitted to a Veterans Administration facility where x-rays showed a collapse of the sixth and an early collapse of the eleventh thoracic vertebrae. The diagnosis was idiopathic osteoporosis, a loss of bone mass. In September of 1962, Coulter resigned from the post office because of his back pain and inability to continue work.\\nIn April of 1964 he entered the Veterans Administration Hospital in Washington, D. C. and remained there for a year. During this stay, it was discovered that there was a large mass involving the first and second thoracic vertebrae, with compression of the spinal cord and accompanying paralysis. The major portion of the tumor was removed by surgery. A Veterans Administration Review Board concluded that he had had the tumor for a few years! prior to 1962, but not likely back as far as 1952 when he concluded his Army service.\\nIn 1967 Coulter fractured his hip and required surgery on two occasions, including the implantation of an artificial joint. In that same year, he underwent a surgical procedure on the fingers of his left hand.\\nAs of December, 1971 Coulter was deemed to have no function in his left hand. In November of 1972, the remainder of the tumor in the thoracic area was surgically removed at the Veterans Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He presently is 5 feet 7 inches tall, weighs 96 pounds, is emaciated, stooped, and has great difficulty in walking and using his hands. He has not had any employment since 1962. The Secretary concedes that he is presently disabled and has been for many years.\\nMr. Coulter\\u2019s contacts with the Social Security Administration have resulted in nothing but frustration. He filed a second application in 1967, but was again denied benefits because of lack of quarters of coverage. A third application was filed on December 5, 1968, listing August, 1962 as the onset of disability. After this in turn was denied, he requested reconsideration, alleging that his disability began in 1953. The Social Security Administration then determined that he met the earnings requirement until September, 30, 1960 but that his work at the post office in 1962 demonstrated an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.\\nAt Mr. Coulter\\u2019s request a hearing was held, and on May 20, 1969 the examiner on review of the evidence concluded that since the claimant had been able to earn $3,900.00 with the post office in 1962, he was not disabled as of September 30, 1960. No appeal was taken from this decision. In none of these proceedings was Mr. Coulter represented by counsel.\\nOn June 13, 1972 the claimant filed his fourth application, that presently under consideration. After a hearing, the administrative law judge concluded that administrative res judicata barred consideration of Mr. Coulter\\u2019s claim and, in the alternative, that he was not disabled in September, 1960 because of the earnings record in 1962. The appeals council affirmed the ruling on res judicata but vacated the alternative holding.\\nOn appeal to the district court, summary judgment was granted for the Secretary on the ground that there had been no abuse of discretion in refusing to reopen the claim filed in 1968.\\nUnlike many other social security cases, the question here is not whether Coulter is currently disabled \\u2014 the Secretary admits that he is. Two other issues are presented: whether Coulter has ever been accorded the full hearing to which he is entitled under the Act; and whether there has been a correct computation of the 20/40 quarter coverage requirement of \\u00a7 223(c), 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 423(c). Determination of the latter question requires an evaluation of Coulter\\u2019s disability in the 1958 \\u2014 1962 period.\\nInitially, we must meet the question of jurisdiction. A number of cases have held that a determination to invoke administrative res judicata by the Secretary is not an appealable order, e. g. Neighbors v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 511 F.2d 80 (10th Cir. 1974); Maddox v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 617 (6th Cir. 1972); Hughes v. Finch, 432 F.2d 93 (4th Cir. 1970). This court has never analyzed that issue in depth. In Phillips v. Celebrezze, 319 F.2d 530 (3d Cir. 1963), a per curiam opinion cited Hobby v. Hodges, 215 F.2d 754 (10th Cir. 1954), and affirmed a district court opinion reported at 211 F.Supp. 510 (E.D.Pa.1962). However, the district court\\u2019s decision was somewhat equivocal and appeared to be based in part on the merits of the case. In Shelton v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 428 F.2d 81 (3d Cir. 1970), the question was posed but not answered. In Davis v. Richardson, 460 F.2d 772 (3d Cir. 1972), the court stated its agreement with Filice v. Celebrezze, 319 F.2d 443 (9th Cir. 1963), but granted review under the Administrative Procedure Act to determine if the Secretary had abused his discretion in refusing to reopen the earlier claim.\\nHobby v. Hodges, supra, and Filice v. Celebrezze, supra, both stand for the proposition that in social security cases the courts do not have jurisdiction to determine if the Secretary correctly applied administrative res judicata. This panel does not agree with the cited cases and their progeny but believes that the Secretary\\u2019s action is reviewable as a final order under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 405(g). Cf. Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). However, since Davis v. Richardson, supra, holds that review under Section 10 of the A.P.A. is available, we follow that route rather than referring this case to the court in banc for reconsideration of our earlier interpretations of \\u00a7 405(g), see Third Circuit I.O.P. M(2).\\nAdministrative res judicata is a significant aid to the efficient operation of an adjudicative agency. However, strict adherence to res judicata\\u2019s restrictive effects is not particularly appropriate in an administrative setting where the claimants are generally not represented by counsel and the process is not based on adversarial concepts. See 2 Davis Administrative Law \\u00a7 18.03 (1958); Lauritzen v. Weinberger, 514 F.2d 561 (8th Cir. 1975); Grose v. Cohen,, 406 F.2d 823 (4th Cir. 1969); Annot., 14 A.L.R. Fed. 776 (1973). In recognition of these factors, the Social Security Administration promulgated regulations which in part provide:\\n\\u201cAn initial, revised, or reconsidered determination of the Administration or a decision or \\u00bfWised decision of an hearing examiner or of the Appeals Council which is otherwise final . . . may be reopened:\\n******\\n(c) At any time when:\\n******\\n(8) Such initial, revised, or reconsidered determination or decision or revised decision is unfavorable, in whole or in part, to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.\\u201d 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.957.\\nOur review of the record reveals such error as would require a reopening of the 1968 claim under the standard set by the regulations. The hearing officers\\u2019 pre-occupation with the claimant\\u2019s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider all of the applicable regulations and to overlook a number of other significant factors which would have a bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim.\\nBecause of the error of the Social Security Administration in 1959, there was no determination at that time as to whether Coulter was disabled. If a finding of disability had been made, Coulter would have become eligible for payment of benefits in 1960 when the Act was amended to eliminate the age requirement. It seems unlikely that he would have secured any employment thereafter in view of his testimony that he worked in 1961 and 1962 only out of dire need despite his pain, disability and need for treatment. At that time his only other source of income was a pension of $67 per month which he received from the Veterans Administration.\\nThe two hearing officers who heard the case after the 1968 and 1972 applications applied the current statutory test for disability. They found that the claimant\\u2019s physical condition had not lasted for a continuous period of twelve months before September 30, 1960 nor could it be expected to last for twelve months or more thereafter. This determination was based on the premise that the 1962 employment demonstrated an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity on September 30, I960.\\nWe recognize the difficulty which faces the Social Security Administration in determining the extent of a claimant\\u2019s disability as it existed some eight or twelve years before an application is filed. But the facile solution of relying almost entirely upon earnings during part of 1962 does not give the claimant the full and complete hearing to which he is entitled.\\nA social security judge acts an an examiner charged with developing the facts, Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 410, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971), and is under an affirmative duty to inquire into all the matters at issue. 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.927. As we said in Hess v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 497 F.2d 837, 840 (3d Cir. 1974):\\n\\u201cAlthough the burden is upon the claimant to prove his disability, due regard for the beneficent purposes of the legislation requires that a more tolerant standard be used in this administrative proceeding than is applicable in a typical suit in a court of record where the adversary system prevails.\\u201d\\nThe social security regulations on evaluation of earnings, 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.1532-1534, in substance provide that wages above a certain level demonstrate a lack of disability. But an exception is provided where the work activities themselves establish that the individual does not have the capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.-1534(b). The social security judge, therefore, cannot end his inquiry when a magic number on the earnings scale appears. The question still is whether the individual is disabled within the meaning of the Act. Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092 (7th Cir. 1974).\\nThe record shows that Coulter held thirteen different jobs in less than ten years. In all but two, he worked for two quarters or less. As the court said in Wilson v. Richardson, 455 F.2d 304, 307 (4th Cir. 1972), this individual\\u2019s \\u201csporadic and transitory activities may demonstrate not his ability, but his inability to engage in substantial gainful activity.\\u201d See also Shutt v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 490 F.2d 43 (5th Cir. 1974).\\nMoreover, the Social Security Administration did not consider whether employment during the period under scrutiny should be considered as a \\u201cperiod of trial work\\u201d which under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 422(c) is \\u201cdeemed not to have been rendered by such individual in determining whether his disability has ceased in a month during such period.\\u201d Since Coulter\\u2019s application for benefits had been filed in 1959, he is entitled to consideration under the \\u201ctrial work\\u201d exemption established by the Act. 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.1536.\\nSimilarly, no consideration was given to whether the claimant came under the exemption of 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.1534(a) which establishes that an individual\\u2019s earnings do not show the absence of a disability when he \\u201cis forced to discontinue his work activities after a short time because his impairment precludes continuing such activities . . . Clearly there was not a full hearing when no consideration was given to such relevant regulations.\\nWe have alluded to the difficulty in evaluating a claimant\\u2019s physical condition many years after the pertinent time. But there are ways to obtain information and the most obvious sources in this field are hospital documentations.\\nRecords were secured from the Veterans Administration covering Mr.' Coulter\\u2019s treatment before 1956 and after 1968. Curiously, none were secured for the V.A. hospital admissions of 1962 and 1964 which might be expected to yield some data helpful to determine conditions in 1960. This omission is noteworthy because Mr. Coulter, before the hearing on his 1968 application, requested in writing that the Social Security Administration secure all his V.A. records since 1953. Despite the all inclusive nature of the request, only the V.A. hospital in Miami, Florida was contacted and only as to data for treatment after 1968. Having undertaken to secure some of the records in partial compliance with the claimant\\u2019s request, the Administration should have secured all which he had authorized. Kephart v. Richardson, 505 F.2d 1085 (3d Cir. 1974).\\nThe most glaring omission in the record, however, is the failure to review records at the Jacksonville Memorial Hospital and the South Florida State Hospital where Mr. Coulter was treated in 1958-1959. These are obvious sources of information critical to the issues involved in this case.\\nWe recognize that the volume of disability claims is increasing and the strain that this has imposed upon the administrative machinery. We are also aware that the burden is on the claimant to produce the necessary evidence. Nevertheless, there must be some recognition of the difficulties under which Mr. Coulter is laboring and the fact that, but for the clerical errors of the Social Security Administration in years past, the data would have long since been assembled.\\nOn remand and after preparation of a more complete record, it is possible that a determination may be made that Mr. Coulter has been disabled within the terms of the Act for some time before\\n1960 and up to the present. If, however, the evidence does' not support such a finding, there is a further inquiry which must be made.\\n42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 423(c) reads in part as follows:\\n\\u201cFor purposes of this section\\u2014\\n(1) An individual shall be insured for disability insurance benefits in any month if\\u2014\\n******\\n(B)(i) if he had not less than twenty quarters of coverage during the forty-quarter period which ends with the quarter in which such month occurred\\n(ii) . . . For purposes of sub-paragraph (B) of this paragraph . a quarter shall'not be counted as part of any period if any part of such quarter was included in a period of disability unless such quarter was a quarter of coverage.\\u201d\\nAs the record now stands, Mr. Coulter is said to be covered only until September 30, 1960. The evidence may well establish that he was disabled for some period preceding the date of his first admission to the hospital in 1958 and extending to either the commencement of his work for the post office in late 1961 or the termination of any applicable period of trial work. If so, a recomputation of the date on which he last met the earnings requirement will be in order.\\nThe logical inconsistency in determining that a disability had not existed for twelve months before September, 1960 because of activity which occurred almost two years after that date is obvious. Only if there is evidence that there was no change in the claimant\\u2019s condition in 1958 \\u2014 1962 can such a finding be supported. None exists in this record, and the claimant\\u2019s condition in 1958-1959 when he was hospitalized for a se ries of electroshock treatments points to a contrary conclusion.\\nIn computing the forty-quarter period within which the individual must have earnings for twenty quarters, a quarter in a \\u201cperiod of disability\\u201d is not counted unless it is a quarter of coverage. The net effect of excluding any quarter of non-coverage beginning in 1958 will be to advance the date of eligibility by a corresponding three-month period. If a sufficient number of quarters of non-coverage are eliminated, even if the disability was terminated by employment at the post office in 1962, the eligibility date may be extended to cover the time when the claimant became disabled.\\nNeither the hearing in 1969 nor the one in 1972 made any findings on this point \\u2014 that is, whether the claimant could establish a \\u201cperiod of disability,\\u201d and this is so even though the hearing examiner in 1969 identified this as an issue for resolution.\\nThe Secretary\\u2019s regulation, 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.310, provides that an individual is entitled to the establishment of a \\u201cperiod of disability\\u201d if he came within the Act\\u2019s definition of disability and, as to a pre1965 application if it were filed during the period when the incapacity existed. Coulter did file his application in 1959 and, having met the requirements of the regulation, is entitled to a determination of the issue.\\nIf Mr. Coulter can prove that he was disabled within the meaning of the Act, he is entitled to a specification of the time limits of the disability. The same standards and considerations to which we have previously referred apply also to the factual determinations of a \\u201cperiod of disability.\\u201d Again, the mere fact that he worked in 1962 is not in and of itself determinative of his ability, or lack of it, to participate in substantial gainful activity in 1958, 1959, 1960 or 1961.\\nThe failure of the 1969 proceeding to make a finding on the question of a period of disability which might well bring about a different result in this case is such error on the face of the evidence as requires the Secretary to reopen the proceedings. See Baerga v. Richardson, 500 F.2d 309 (3d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 931, 95 S.Ct. 1133, 43 L.Ed.2d 403 (1975). Moreover, the failure to apply the relevant standards for determination of disability in the unusual circumstance of this case also mandates a reconsideration. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be vacated so that it can remand this matter to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n. In 1959 a disabled worker under the age of 50 was not entitled to receive monetary payments. However, he was entitled to the benefits of a \\u201cdisability freeze\\u201d which would preserve his insured status even though he was not working during the period of incapacity. The fifty year age requirement was eliminated by the Social Security Act amendments of 1960. See 1960 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin. News, p. 3622.\\n. Because he was under the Civil Service System during this particular period, he received no credits toward Social Security eligibility. In 1958, because he was in a temporary employee status, the post office did allow credit for Social Security benefits.\\n. Idiopathic osteoporosis is a spontaneous \\u201cabnormal rarefaction of bone, seen most commonly in the elderly. Depending on the extent of demineralization of bone, it may be accompanied by pain, particularly of the lower back; deformities, such as loss of stature; and pathological fractures.\\u201d \\u2022 Dorland\\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary (25th ed. 1974).\\n. Once again the Social Security Administration erroneously computed the quarters of coverage. In a letter dated September 15, 1972 it said that Coulter last met the earnings requirement on January 30, 1956, despite the fact that in 1968 the critical date was determined on reconsideration to be September 30, 1960.\\n. See the discussion by Judge Gewin in Ortego v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1005 (5th Cir. 1975), and Judge Friendly\\u2019s opinion in Cappadora v. Celebrezze, 356 F.2d 1 (2d Cir. 1966).\\n. In the 1967 amendments to \\u00a7 223, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 423, Congress provided that earnings above a certain amount designated by the Secretary would establish that the claimant was able to perform substantial gainful activity. 1967 U.S. Code Cong, and Admin.News, pp. 2880-83. See Harris v. Richardson, 450 F.2d 1099 (4th Cir. 1971). Section 158(e) of Pub.L. 90-248 provided that the amendment would apply to all applications filed in or after January, 1968.\\n. Coulter had accumulated 20 quarters of coverage before he was hospitalized in 1958. But his working history both before and after 1958 is so sporadic that the appropriate umbrella of 40 quarters takes him only as far as September of 1960. Eliminating quarters when he did not earn coverage will extend the period within which he may apply the 20 covered quarters.\\n. Even at the expense of prolonging an already lengthy opinion, it seems appropriate to quote from Justice Douglas\\u2019 dissent in Richardson v. Perales, supra 402 U.S. at 413, 91 S.Ct. at 1433:\\n\\u201cThis case is minuscule in relation to the staggering problems of the Nation. But when a grave injustice is wreaked on an individual by the presently powerful federal bureaucracy, it is a matter of concern to everyone, for these days the average man can say: \\u2018There but for the- grace of God go I.\\u2019 \\u201d\"\n",

      "    \"meta.previous_text\": \"OPINION OF THE COURT\\nWEIS, Circuit Judge.\\nClaimant Merle Fowler is presently disabled by multiple sclerosis. Hampered by the necessity to establish an onset date within her coverage period, she has been unsuccessful in securing disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. Difficulties in proof abound, for the disease is a progressive one, the initial date of disability is seldom easy to determine, and periods of remission are common. And as if these problems were not enough, they were compounded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\\u2019s loss or destruction of critical records relating to claimant\\u2019s first application for benefits. After a thorough review of the case, we conclude the HEW determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966 is not supported by the evidence. Finding adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record, we remand to the Secretary for consideration of Miss Fowler\\u2019s request to reopen because of error on the record.\\nFrom the early 1950\\u2019s on, Miss Fowler worked for various medical schools as a recordkeeper, secretary, and nurse. From 1963 to 1967, she was employed at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. That institution did not participate in the Social Security program and her coverage earned while at other jobs terminated on June 30,1966. Claimant\\u2019s testimony before the administrative law judge revealed that it was during her service at U.C.L.A. that she began to encounter increasingly serious and bizarre physical disabilities. These difficulties included: problems in maintaining her balance that were severe enough to attract accusations of being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; a four-week period during which she had to crawl because of an inability to stand; slurred speech resulting in communication problems with coworkers and patients; difficulty in typing. Miss Fowler was forced to use up all of her vacation time as well as her sick leave because of her illness. Additionally, she often found it necessary to rest over long lunch hours.\\nMiss Fowler continued to cling to her employment because she was living alone and was her own sole means of support. In February 1967, her condition was such that she could no longer be retained even by the most sympathetic and understanding employer. At about this time her condition was finally diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. She then went to live with her sister in Florida, and for a period of about a year and a half was both bedridden and mentally disoriented. During this interval, her sister filed a disability claim for her with the Social Security Administration, which was rejected, according to the sister, because the claimant did not have enough quarters of coverage.\\nThe claimant enjoyed a period of remission from 1970 to 1973 when she was able to obtain limited employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but thereafter her disease was again disabling. She filed for disability benefits on March 25, 1974, alleging disability from 1965. After an initial denial, the Secretary referred her case for disability evaluation to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation. That agency, based on information that severe symptoms were observable at some time in 1965 or early 1966, concluded that a closed period of disability was established between December 31, 1965 and February 1, 1970, when remission occurred. The Secretary, however, disallowed the payment of any benefit because the 1974 claim had been filed more than twelve months after the first period of disability had ceased in 1970. See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 416(i)(2)(E). The claimant then requested a hearing, asserting that the 1968 claim filed by her sister had been erroneously denied and should be reopened. On the basis of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation disability evaluation, claimant believed she was entitled to benefits for the 1965 \\u2014 1970 period. The ALJ, however, bypassed the 1968 claim issue altogether, finding instead that there had been no disability before June 30, 1966. The Appeals Council affirmed and the district court ruled there was substantial evidence supporting the Secretary\\u2019s decision.\\nLooking first to the determination of the onset of disability, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the ALJ\\u2019s decision.\\nThe claimant\\u2019s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing. She tried desperately to hold her job and exerted extraordinary efforts to cope with her disability. Her case did not rely upon her testimony alone but was supported by several statements from persons familiar with her at that time. A letter from Justine Walker, a coworker, was received into evidence and corroborated Miss Fowler\\u2019s account of her difficulties. In addition, the detailed statements of two physicians who were aware of her condition during the period were made part of the record. Dr. Donald A. Adams, her treating physician, stated:\\n\\u201c[Bjeyond question . . . she had multiple sclerosis dating back probably to 1965 and early 1966.\\u201d\\nHe said further:\\n\\u201cwere she an employee of mine during late 1965 and early 1966 I would have had no other alternative except to terminate her due to her illness even though the consequences would have been that she would be unable to procure another job.\\u201d\\nDr. Jack A. Cannon, her employer in 1965, said that she should not have been working at that time.\\n\\u201cHowever, in considering what would happen to her if I did recommend that she be terminated, I had to realize that she would be unable to secure another position because of the problems, and that I could not recommend her for other employment based on her mental and physical condition.\\u201d\\nHer physician at the time of the hearing, Dr. Lawrence D. Ellis, came to a similar opinion after reviewing Miss Fowler\\u2019s records. He believed she was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment for a period beginning in late 1965. Moreover, the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation report, which, after careful study, found that disability existed as of December 31, 1965, was totally ignored in the ALJ\\u2019s decision. The ALJ did not refer to any of the foregoing evidence, but merely summarized the medical reports relating to the disability period prior to June 30, 1966 as giving \\u201cno indication of severe and protracted disability prior to that date.\\u201d\\nThis conclusory statement misses the mark on several counts. It fails to observe the appropriate legal standard, whether claimant is unable \\u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity,\\u201d 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 416(i)(l), 423(d)(1), and substitutes a far harsher requirement. Additionally, the statement is directly contrary to the evidence submitted by the physicians familiar with claimant\\u2019s condition. In fact, it is not supported by any medical opinion in this case. As we commented in Gober v. Matthews, 574 F.2d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1978), an ALJ is not free to set his own expertise against that of physicians who present competent medical evidence.\\nThe ALJ\\u2019s opinion drew some unsupported inferences from the fact that claimant had been employed by physicians. The ALJ commented, \\u201cit is axiomatic that physicians take care of their own.\\u201d The thrust of this remark is somewhat obscure because the record indicates the employers did take care of claimant by retaining her for a longer period than that which could be justified by her failing health. To that extent, the \\u201caxiom\\u201d tends to support Miss Fowler\\u2019s claim that she continued to work even though physically incapable of performing the tasks demanded of her. Moreover, her employment after the cut-off date does not foreclose an award of benefits since disability \\u201cturns on whether she was disabled within the meaning of the Act notwithstanding the fact that she actually did work.\\u201d Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir. 1974).\\nWe find it particularly puzzling that the ALJ ignored the findings on disability reached by the state agency to which the Secretary had referred the matter. That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ\\u2019s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.\\nAfter careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary\\u2019s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.\\nWe must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.\\n\",\n",

The Appeals Council, on review of the record, reversed the administrative law judge. It found that Mrs. Lauritzen could perform light clerical work during the period in question and that the evidence did not warrant a revision of its earlier decision to terminate Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s benefits. The Council also stated that the October 22, 1965, determination was final and binding and not subject to reopening under 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7\\u00a7 404.956 or 404.957(c). The District Court, on review, recognized the right to reopen pursuant to \\u00a7 404.957(c)(8), but stated that Mrs. Lau-ritzen had not shown that there was error on the face of the evidence. It also held that since the August 1, 1967, final decision was not subject to being reopened, it was binding under principles of administrative res judicata. The critical question is, of course, what is meant by error on the face of the evidence. The Claims Manual and judicial decisions provide the guide. The question is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, see United States v. Smith, 482 F.2d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir. 1973); Grose v. Cohen, 406 F.2d 823, 825 (4th Cir. 1969); Anderson v. Weinberger, 380 F.Supp. 640, 644 (D.Md.1974), or whether there is manifest error in the record, see Harrah v. Richardson, 446 F.2d 1, 2 (4th Cir. 1971); Easley v. Finch, 431 F.2d 1351, 1353 (4th Cir. 1970); but see Domozik v. Cohen, 413 F.2d 5 (3rd Cir. 1969).

Richardson, supra, holds that review under Section 10 of the A.P.A. is available, we follow that route rather than referring this case to the court in banc for reconsideration of our earlier interpretations of \\u00a7 405(g), see Third Circuit I.O.P. M(2). Administrative res judicata is a significant aid to the efficient operation of an adjudicative agency. However, strict adherence to res judicata\\u2019s restrictive effects is not particularly appropriate in an administrative setting where the claimants are generally not represented by counsel and the process is not based on adversarial concepts. See 2 Davis Administrative Law \\u00a7 18.03 (1958); Lauritzen v. Weinberger, 514 F.2d 561 (8th Cir. 1975); Grose v. Cohen,, 406 F.2d 823 (4th Cir. 1969); Annot., 14 A.L.R. Fed. 776 (1973). In recognition of these factors, the Social Security Administration promulgated regulations which in part provide: \\u201cAn initial, revised, or reconsidered determination of the Administration or a decision or \\u00bfWised decision of an hearing examiner or of the Appeals Council which is otherwise final . . . may be reopened: ****** (c) At any time when: ****** (8) Such initial, revised, or reconsidered determination or decision or revised decision is unfavorable, in whole or in part, to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.\\u201d 20 C.F.R. \\u00a7 404.957. Our review of the record reveals such error as would require a reopening of the 1968 claim under the standard set by the regulations.

Our task then is to examine the record to determine whether there was manifest injustice in terminating Mrs. Lauritzen\\u2019s social security disability benefits in October of 1965. We believe that there was such injustice. The record shows that Mrs. Lauritzen was steadily employed from 1942. to 1961 in various factory, office and clerical jobs. In the fall of 1963, she developed shortness of breath and chest pains when under strain or when \\u201ctrying to do something.\\u201d On April 12, 1964, she was admitted to a hospital where her condition was diagnosed as \\u201carteriosclerotic heart disease with cardiac decompensation and anterior myocardial ischemea.\\u201d She was released from the hospital on May 23, 1964. Thereafter, she made application for and was awarded disability benefits of $77.00 per month effective June, 1964, with the condition that she be reexamined in one year. On October 22, 1965, HEW notified Mrs. Lauritzen that her disability benefits would be terminated on November 30, 1965. It apparently took this action on the basis of a medical report by a HEW physician that Mrs. Lauritzen was\"\n",

    "# any evidence that a member had “to modify or change his/her vacation plans due to the management’s ‘new interpretation of its rights under the vacation and management rights clauses of the labor agreement.” Arbitrator’s Decision, Slip op. at 6. In contrast, management was “vague on the specifics of not being able to meet the necessities of the supervisors and the production needs of the newspaper.” Id. The arbitrator made no further findings, but instead found that the Union’s grievance was justified. He then crafted his own solution, whereby the four new supervisors and the Union employees were thrown into a “seniority pool” for vacation selection purposes. He also provided for a grievance procedure through the Union for employees that believed they were adversely affected by the new procedure. The Beacon Journal refused to comply with the arbitration award and instead instituted this lawsuit under section 801 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court enforced the award. The Beacon Journal filed this timely appeal. II. This court reviews the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Rowley v. United States, 76 F.3d 796, 799 (6th Cir.1996). Nevertheless, our scope of review, like the review of the district court, is extremely limited. The Supreme Court has made clear in the Steelworkers’ Trilogy and its progeny that courts must accord an arbitrator’s decision substantial deference because it is the arbitrator’s construction of the agreement, not the court’s construction, to which the parties have agreed. See United Paperworkers Int’l Union v. Misco, 484 U.S. 29, 37-8, 108 S.Ct. 364, 371, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987) (“Because the parties have contracted to have disputes settled by an arbitrator chosen by them rather than by a judge, it is the arbitrator’s view\n",

As a result of the plant closing on October 17, 2001, all but one employee was terminated during the calendar year, 2001. The Company refused to pay vacationpay benefits to employees who did not work for the Company on January 1, 2002. The Union filed a grievance.\n",

    "# (c) An employee covered by the agreement who is actually working on January 1st of any year and who has at least six (6) months seniority and has' worked at least eight hundred (800) hours from and after January 1st of the previous year shall be paid the equivalent of two-and-one half (2-1/2) days vacation pay.\n",

    "# Pursuant to Article 5 of the labor contract, the parties arbitrated the grievance. At the arbitration the Union asserted that because it was not the employees’ fault that they were unable to work the full year, the employees were entitled to their vacation pay. The arbitrator granted the grievance, allowing all plaintiffs, who, but for being laid off, would have been able to continue employment and thereby qualify for vacation benefits. The arbitrator reasoned that “[i]t would be unreasonable to cause such forfeitures particularly where an employee has no control over the situation.”\n",
    "# The Company filed a complaint in the district court asserting that the arbitrator’s award contradicted the clear, mandatory commands of the labor contract, which required that an employee be “actually working” for the Company as of January 1, 2002, to receive vacation pay.
