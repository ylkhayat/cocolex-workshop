      "    \"prompt\": \"Continue to write the following case in the style of my writeup. Your answer should range from 100 to 400 words. Make your answer concise, and avoid redundant languages and assumptions. Below is what I have written so far:\\n\\nR. DORSEY WATKINS, District Judge.\\nThis is a suit by the plaintiffs (hereinafter Nelson and Smith) against the defendant, their employer (hereinafter Victory) to recover moneys allegedly due and to become due under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into on June 25, 1959 between United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (hereinafter Union) and Victory. This agreement provided that Victory would \\u201ccarry an excess compensation policy on his employees when they are working outside of the District of Columbia which shall give the employees * * * additional compensation in Maryland and Virginia equal to that of the District of Columbia.\\u201d\\nThe underlying facts have all been stipulated.\\nNelson and Smith, while employed by Victory and while working for Victory, sustained accidental personal injuries \\u25a0arising out of and in the course of their \\u25a0employment. Each received an award from the State Industrial Accident Commission, under which (to October 29, 1963):\\nNelson had received under the Maryland Award:\\nTemporary total disability $ 880.00\\nTemporary partial disability 200.00\\nPermanent partial disability 1,875.00\\n$2,955.00\\nUnder the District of Columbia Compensation Act, his compensation would have been:\\nTemporary total disability $1,188.00\\nTemporary partial disability 200.00\\nPermanent partial disability\\n($15.00 a week from April 25,\\n1961 to October 29, 1963) 1,965.00\\n$3,353.00\\nPlus \\u201cexcess benefits\\u201d payable at $15.00 per week, or $780.00 per year, until a total of $17,280 is paid. Nelson is fifty-\\u25a0eight years old and has a life expectancy\\nof nineteen years, or $14,280 based on life expectancy. Smith had received under the Maryland award:\\nTemporary total disability $ 640.00\\nPermanent partial disability 3,125.00\\n$3,765.00\\nUnder the District of Columbia Compensation Act, his compensation would have been:\\nTemporary total disability $ 864.00\\nPermanent partial disability ($25.00 per week from November 21,1960 to October 29, 1963) 3,825.00\\n$4,689.00\\nPlus \\u201cexcess benefits\\u201d payable at $25.00 per week, or $1,300.00 per year, until a total of $17,280.00 is paid. Smith is forty-six years old and has a life ex-pectaney of twenty-seven years.\\nJurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship, Nelson and Smith being residents and citizens of the District of Columbia, and Victory being a corporation with its principal place of business in Louisiana, but which had been doing business in Maryland. The \\u201ccontract\\u201d allegedly involved related to performance within the State of Maryland. It is alleged that the amount in controversy, as to each of Nelson and Smith, exceeds $10,000, exclusive of interests and costs.\\nService was purportedly made upon Victory through the State Department of Assessment and Taxation of the State of Maryland. Victory moved to dismiss on the ground that at the time suit was instituted Victory had ceased to do business in the State of Maryland. The motion was denied by Judge Edward S. Northrop, on the basis of Chief Judge Roszel C. Thomsen\\u2019s opinion in L\\u2019Hereux v. Central American Airways Flying Service, Inc., D.Md.1962, 209 F.Supp. 713, and on the ground of waiver, with both of which opinions this judge is in accord.\\nVictory then answered, raising as defenses that if there were an agreement as alleged, it was contrary to Article 101, section 52 of the Maryland Code of Public General Laws; and that the Union agreement, if executed, was not binding upon it.\\n1. Section 51 provides in pertinent part as follows:\\n\\u201cNo employer or employee who is subject to the provisions of this article shall exempt himself from the burden or waive the benefit of this article by any contract, agreement, rule or regulation, and any such contract, agreement, rule or regulation shall be pro tanto void.\\u201d\\nThe argument in substance is that one of the benefits of Article 101 to the employer is the provision of section 15 that the liability to pay compensation according to the schedules \\u201cis exclusive.\\u201d However, section 51 would not appear to prevent the employer, by agreement independent of, and outside of the provisions of Article 101 from complementing or supplementing the Compensation Act as to the total sums recoverable or receivable.\\nThe dictum, if not the express holding, in Baltimore Transit Company v. Har-roll, 1958, 217 Md. 169, 141 A.2d 912, strongly supports the position of Nelson and Smith. In the Harroll case an employee had sought to recover medical and hospital expenses allegedly payable under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, and prevailed in the lower court. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that where plaintiff had first received compensation benefits, then settled his claim against the negligent third party, out of which settlement the insurer of the employer had been repaid the compensation, plus the amount of hospital and doctor\\u2019s bills it had paid plaintiff, he could not recover the hospital and doctor\\u2019s bills on the theory that such medical care had been furnished under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. The court said (217 Md. at 177, 141 A.2d at 916):\\n\\u201cWe cannot read Article 17 as requiring the company to pay over to an employee the hospital and medical expenses it has received from a tortfeasor. If the parties had so intended and had clearly expressed that intent, they could have agreed that any such expenses recouped by the employer and made his by the statute, must be given by him to the injured employee, but the provisions of Article 17 fall far short of such an agreement, as we read them.\\u201d\\nHowever, the court recognized the validity of the supplementation of benefits under the Act, saying (217 Md. at 173-174, 141 A.2d at 914) :\\n\\u201cThere are significant indications that Article 17 of the agreement was to complement the compensation act and not to supplement or supplant it in any respect. It would be entirely competent for the parties by express contract to supplement the benefits under the Act or to relax its restrictions or requirements in favor of the employees. 2 Larson, Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law, Sec. 97.61; Sharp v. Foley Brothers, Sup., 69 N.Y.S.2d 514.\\u201d\\nThe Harroll case is construed as follows in 23 M.L.E. Workmen\\u2019s Compensation \\u00a7 181:\\n\\u201cAccordingly, as a general rule, an employee may not, by an agreement, waive rights given under the Act, or waive a claim for compensation before the disability takes place. However, it is entirely competent for an employer and an employee by express contract to supplement benefits under the Act or to relax its restrictions or requirements in favor of the employee.\\u201d\\nThe first defense is accordingly without merit.\\n2. The Union agreement was signed on behalf of Victory by its Project Manager in charge of Victory\\u2019s work at the job site in Maryland. It was stipulated that the Vice President and General Counsel of Victory, if a witness, would testify that the signature of the Union agreement was without the knowledge and consent of the officers and directors of Victory; that no resolution was ever passed by the officers or directors of Victory authorizing or ratifying the agreement; that it was the custom for Victory to subcontract work of the type done by Nelson and Smith; that before the contract in question, Victory had never signed any contracts with any \\u201cexcess compensation benefits\\u201d such as the contract in question; and that Victory had always hired only union employees.\\nIt was also stipulated that Victory paid wages to its carpenter-employees (including Nelson and Smith) in accordance with the wage rates in the agreement, which were those prevailing in the District of Columbia and higher than those prevailing at the work site; that Victory made contributions to the Health and Welfare Fund in accordance with Article VII, Section 17 of the Agreement ; and that Victory abided by all other working conditions of the agreement.\\nIt was further stipulated that the Project Manager had authority to hire and fire employees at the job site; and that he communicated with officials of the Union for the purpose of employing carpenters on the job and that thereafter Nelson, Smith and other union carpenters were employed on the job.\\nSince the Project Manager had authority to hire and fire, and since he could hire only union carpenters , he would have at least apparent authority to execute the agreement necessary for their employment. Brager v. Levy, 1914, 122 Md. 554, 560, 90 A. 102; 2 Am.Jur. Agency, section 348; 3 Am.Jur.2d, Agency, section 263.\\nMoreover, the payment of wages in accordance with those prescribed in the Union agreement, and the payments into the Union Health and Welfare Fund, in addition to wages, would be waiver, or constitute an estoppel or a ratification (Southern Industries, Inc. v. United States, 9 Cir. 1964, 326 F.2d 221), as to the authority of the Project Manager.\\nThe second defense is accordingly without merit.\\nThe complaint asked for judgment in favor of Nelson for all accrued payments for temporary total, temporary partial and permanent partial disability, and an order that future payments be made to him at the rate of $15.00 per week during the continuance of his permanent partial disability or until the sum of $17,280.00 be paid; and in favor of Smith for all accrued payments for temporary total and permanent partial disability, and an order that future payments be made at the rate of $25.00 per week during the continuance of his permanent partial disability or until the sum of $17,280.00 be paid. The complaint also asks for such other and further relief as may be necessary.\\nOn the question of jurisdiction of the court to entertain a diversity suit where the amounts accrued at the time of bringing the suit, and at the time of trial, were less than the jurisdictional amount, but where the addition of the future weekly sums sought would exceed the $10,000.00 requirement, and on the question of the authority of the court to order the payment of future weekly amounts, Nelson and Smith have filed a memorandum, in which Victory concurs, supporting the jurisdiction of the court, and the authority of the court to order future payments.\\n\",\n",

This Court has rejected such a restrictive interpretation of the statute creating diversity jurisdiction. It has held that a possibility that payments will terminate before the total reaches the jurisdictional minimum is immaterial if the right to all the payments is in issue. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra [293 U.S. 96, 55 S.Ct. 1, 79 L.Ed. 219] ; Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551, 33 S.Ct. 129, 57 L.Ed. 347.

Flowers, supra, cases on the ground that they are for death benefits payable to a dependent upon whose death payments would cease, rather than, as here, for disability benefits which would decrease or terminate if the employee\\u2019s disability diminished or vanished. We cannot make such distinction. We think Aetna Casualty Co. v. Flowers, supra, is controlling. The reasoning of the Supreme Court is no less applicable to the case before us than to the case reviewed and decided by it. If the condition subsequent of death, which is certain, does not restrict jurisdiction, the uncertain condition of a diminishing of incapacity will not do so. We conclude that the requirement of the federal jurisdictional amount was met. The parties are in agreement that the test of \\u201cdisability\\u201d is whether the employee can do the same type of work he was doing at the time of his accident in the customary way without any unusual difficulty or pain. Knispel v. Gulf States Utilities Co., Inc., 174 La. 401, 141 So. 9; Fisher v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., La.App., 28 So.2d 59. Ample proof supported the finding of disability.\\n\\n230 F.2d 793\\nU. S. 672, 678, 56 S.Ct. 615, 617, 80 L. Ed. 971), future installments could not be considered in determining whether the jurisdictional amount was involved, even though the judgment would be determinative of liability for future installments as they accrued. Wright v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 19 F.2d 117, affirmed 276 U.S. 602, 48 S.Ct. 323, 72 L.Ed. 726. Cf. Button v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., D.C., 48 F.Supp. 168. But this is not that type of case. For the Tennessee statute which creates liability for the award contemplates a single action for the determination of claimant\\u2019s right to benefits and a single judgment for the award granted. See Tenn. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 6880, 6881, 6890, 6891, 6893; Shockley v. Morristown Produce & Ice Co., 171 Tenn. 591, 106 S.W.2d 562. \\u201cNor does the fact that it cannot be known as a matter of absolute certainty that the amount which may ultimately be paid, if respondent prevails, will exceed $3,000, mean that the jurisdictional amount is lacking.

DORSEY WATKINS, District Judge.\\nThis is a suit by the plaintiffs (hereinafter Nelson and Smith) against the defendant, their employer (hereinafter Victory) to recover moneys allegedly due and to become due under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into on June 25, 1959 between United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (hereinafter Union) and Victory. This agreement provided that Victory would \\u201ccarry an excess compensation policy on his employees when they are working outside of the District of Columbia which shall give the employees * * * additional compensation in Maryland and Virginia equal to that of the District of Columbia.\\u201d\\nThe underlying facts have all been stipulated.\\nNelson and Smith, while employed by Victory and while working for Victory, sustained accidental personal injuries \\u25a0arising out of and in the course of their \\u25a0employment. Each received an award from the State Industrial Accident Commission, under which (to October 29, 1963):\\nNelson had received under the Maryland Award:\\nTemporary total disability $ 880.00\\nTemporary partial disability 200.00\\nPermanent partial disability 1,875.00\\n$2,955.00\\nUnder the District of Columbia Compensation Act, his compensation would have been:\\nTemporary total disability $1,188.00\\nTemporary partial disability 200.00\\nPermanent partial disability\\n($15.00 a week from April 25,\\n1961 to October 29, 1963) 1,965.00\\n$3,353.00\\nPlus \\u201cexcess benefits\\u201d payable at $15.00 per week, or $780.00 per year, until a total of $17,280 is paid. Nelson is fifty-\\u25a0eight years old and has a life expectancy\\nof nineteen years, or $14,280 based on life expectancy. Smith had received under the Maryland award:\\nTemporary total disability $ 640.00\\nPermanent partial disability 3,125.00\\n$3,765.00\\nUnder the District of Columbia Compensation Act, his compensation would have been:\\nTemporary total disability $ 864.00\\nPermanent partial disability ($25.00 per week from November 21,1960 to October 29, 1963) 3,825.00\\n$4,689.00\\nPlus \\u201cexcess benefits\\u201d payable at $25.00 per week, or $1,300.00 per year, until a total of $17,280.00 is paid. Smith is forty-six years old and has a life ex-pectaney of twenty-seven years.\\nJurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship, Nelson and Smith being residents and citizens of the District of Columbia, and Victory being a corporation with its principal place of business in Louisiana, but which had been doing business in Maryland. The \\u201ccontract\\u201d allegedly involved related to performance within the State of Maryland. It is alleged that the amount in controversy, as to each of Nelson and Smith, exceeds $10,000, exclusive of interests and costs.\\nService was purportedly made upon Victory through the State Department of Assessment and Taxation of the State of Maryland. Victory moved to dismiss on the ground that at the time suit was instituted Victory had ceased to do business in the State of Maryland. The motion was denied by Judge Edward S. Northrop, on the basis of Chief Judge Roszel C. Thomsen\\u2019s opinion in L\\u2019Hereux v. Central American Airways Flying Service, Inc., D.Md.1962, 209 F.Supp. 713, and on the ground of waiver, with both of which opinions this judge is in accord.\\nVictory then answered, raising as defenses that if there were an agreement as alleged, it was contrary to Article 101, section 52 of the Maryland Code of Public General Laws; and that the Union agreement, if executed, was not binding upon it.\\n1. Section 51 provides in pertinent part as follows:\\n\\u201cNo employer or employee who is subject to the provisions of this article shall exempt himself from the burden or waive the benefit of this article by any contract, agreement, rule or regulation, and any such contract, agreement, rule or regulation shall be pro tanto void.\\u201d\\nThe argument in substance is that one of the benefits of Article 101 to the employer is the provision of section 15 that the liability to pay compensation according to the schedules \\u201cis exclusive.\\u201d However, section 51 would not appear to prevent the employer, by agreement independent of, and outside of the provisions of Article 101 from complementing or supplementing the Compensation Act as to the total sums recoverable or receivable.\\nThe dictum, if not the express holding, in Baltimore Transit Company v. Har-roll, 1958, 217 Md. 169, 141 A.2d 912, strongly supports the position of Nelson and Smith. In the Harroll case an employee had sought to recover medical and hospital expenses allegedly payable under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, and prevailed in the lower court. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that where plaintiff had first received compensation benefits, then settled his claim against the negligent third party, out of which settlement the insurer of the employer had been repaid the compensation, plus the amount of hospital and doctor\\u2019s bills it had paid plaintiff, he could not recover the hospital and doctor\\u2019s bills on the theory that such medical care had been furnished under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. The court said (217 Md. at 177, 141 A.2d at 916):\\n\\u201cWe cannot read Article 17 as requiring the company to pay over to an employee the hospital and medical expenses it has received from a tortfeasor. If the parties had so intended and had clearly expressed that intent, they could have agreed that any such expenses recouped by the employer and made his by the statute, must be given by him to the injured employee, but the provisions of Article 17 fall far short of such an agreement, as we read them.\\u201d\\nHowever, the court recognized the validity of the supplementation of benefits under the Act, saying (217 Md. at 173-174, 141 A.2d at 914) :\\n\\u201cThere are significant indications that Article 17 of the agreement was to complement the compensation act and not to supplement or supplant it in any respect. It would be entirely competent for the parties by express contract to supplement the benefits under the Act or to relax its restrictions or requirements in favor of the employees. 2 Larson, Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law, Sec. 97.61; Sharp v. Foley Brothers, Sup., 69 N.Y.S.2d 514.\\u201d\\nThe Harroll case is construed as follows in 23 M.L.E. Workmen\\u2019s Compensation \\u00a7 181:\\n\\u201cAccordingly, as a general rule, an employee may not, by an agreement, waive rights given under the Act, or waive a claim for compensation before the disability takes place. However, it is entirely competent for an employer and an employee by express contract to supplement benefits under the Act or to relax its restrictions or requirements in favor of the employee.\\u201d\\nThe first defense is accordingly without merit.\\n2. The Union agreement was signed on behalf of Victory by its Project Manager in charge of Victory\\u2019s work at the job site in Maryland. It was stipulated that the Vice President and General Counsel of Victory, if a witness, would testify that the signature of the Union agreement was without the knowledge and consent of the officers and directors of Victory; that no resolution was ever passed by the officers or directors of Victory authorizing or ratifying the agreement; that it was the custom for Victory to subcontract work of the type done by Nelson and Smith; that before the contract in question, Victory had never signed any contracts with any \\u201cexcess compensation benefits\\u201d such as the contract in question; and that Victory had always hired only union employees.\\nIt was also stipulated that Victory paid wages to its carpenter-employees (including Nelson and Smith) in accordance with the wage rates in the agreement, which were those prevailing in the District of Columbia and higher than those prevailing at the work site; that Victory made contributions to the Health and Welfare Fund in accordance with Article VII, Section 17 of the Agreement ; and that Victory abided by all other working conditions of the agreement.\\nIt was further stipulated that the Project Manager had authority to hire and fire employees at the job site; and that he communicated with officials of the Union for the purpose of employing carpenters on the job and that thereafter Nelson, Smith and other union carpenters were employed on the job.\\nSince the Project Manager had authority to hire and fire, and since he could hire only union carpenters , he would have at least apparent authority to execute the agreement necessary for their employment. Brager v. Levy, 1914, 122 Md. 554, 560, 90 A. 102; 2 Am.Jur. Agency, section 348; 3 Am.Jur.2d, Agency, section 263.\\nMoreover, the payment of wages in accordance with those prescribed in the Union agreement, and the payments into the Union Health and Welfare Fund, in addition to wages, would be waiver, or constitute an estoppel or a ratification (Southern Industries, Inc. v. United States, 9 Cir. 1964, 326 F.2d 221), as to the authority of the Project Manager.\\nThe second defense is accordingly without merit.\\nThe complaint asked for judgment in favor of Nelson for all accrued payments for temporary total, temporary partial and permanent partial disability, and an order that future payments be made to him at the rate of $15.00 per week during the continuance of his permanent partial disability or until the sum of $17,280.00 be paid; and in favor of Smith for all accrued payments for temporary total and permanent partial disability, and an order that future payments be made at the rate of $25.00 per week during the continuance of his permanent partial disability or until the sum of $17,280.00 be paid. The complaint also asks for such other and further relief as may be necessary.\\nOn the question of jurisdiction of the court to entertain a diversity suit where the amounts accrued at the time of bringing the suit, and at the time of trial, were less than the jurisdictional amount, but where the addition of the future weekly sums sought would exceed the $10,000.00 requirement, and on the question of the authority of the court to order the payment of future weekly amounts, Nelson and Smith have filed a memorandum, in which Victory concurs, supporting the jurisdiction of the court, and the authority of the court to order future payments.\\n\",\n",

      "                \"Mr. Justice Douglas\\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThis action for death benefits under the Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law of Tennessee (Tenn. Code Ann. 1934, \\u00a7 6851 et seq.) was commenced in 1945 by plaintiff-respondent in the Chancery Court of Hawkins County, Tennessee. The defendants-petitioners are the former employer of her deceased husband and the employer\\u2019s insurance carrier. Service was had on the insurance carrier in Hawkins County, and on the employer in Knox County. Respondent is a citizen of Tennessee, the employer is a North Carolina corporation, and the insurance carrier is a Connecticut corporation. The complaint alleged that respondent\\u2019s husband died as the result of an accident occurring in the course of his employment. Burial expenses plus benefits in the amount of $5,000, the maximum under the Tennessee statute, were sought on behalf of respondent and her two minor children, aged twelve and fifteen.\\nOn May 28, 1945, petitioners mailed a notice of intention to file a petition for removal to a federal District Court which was received by respondent\\u2019s attorney on the morning of May 29. The petition for removal was filed in the Chancery Court the same day, and on June 5 the removal order issued. In the federal court the petitioners moved for dismissal on the ground that venue was not properly laid in the Hawkins County Court, so that under Tennessee law that court had lacked jurisdiction. Respondent sought a remand of the case to the state court, contending that the requisites of diversity jurisdiction had not been met either as to jurisdictional amount or as to proper notice of filing of the removal petition, and that the suit was not removable because not one of a civil nature in law or equity. The District Court concluded that Hawkins County was not the proper venue. It thereupon dismissed the action without reaching the questions raised by respondent\\u2019s motion for a remand.\\nThe judgment was reversed on appeal. 154 F. 2d 881. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the jurisdictional minimum of $3,000 in controversy (Judicial Code \\u00a7 24, 28 U. S. C. \\u00a7 41 (1)) was not present, and therefore ordered the case remanded to the state court. In this disposition the Circuit Court of Appeals reached neither the state venue question raised by petitioners, nor respondent\\u2019s contention that the required notice of the filing of the removal petition was lacking. We granted certiorari because of an apparent conflict with Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, 293 U. S. 96, as to the jurisdictional minimum requirement.\\nFirst. It is suggested that a decision of a Circuit Court of Appeals ordering remand of a case to a state court is not reviewable. And it is also said that we lack power to review the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals, since the mandate of that court has issued and the District Court has remanded the cause to the state court.\\nAn order of a District Court remanding a cause to the state court from whence it came is not appealable, and hence may not be reviewed either in the Circuit Court of Appeals or here. Judicial Code \\u00a7 28, 28 U. S. C. \\u00a7 71; Kloeb v. Armour & Co., 311 U. S. 199; Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Stevens, 312 U. S. 563; United States v. Rice, 327 U. S. 742. But no such limitation affects our authority to review an action of the Circuit Court of Appeals, directing a remand to a state court. Gay v. Ruff, 292 U. S. 25. Nor does the fact that the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals has issued defeat this Court\\u2019s jurisdiction. Carr v. Zaja, 283 U. S. 52, and cases cited.\\nSecond. We think that the jurisdictional amount of $3,000 was involved in this suit. The contrary conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals was based on the nature of the award under the Tennessee statute. The award may be paid in installments at regular intervals by the employer or by a trustee with whom the amount of the award, reduced to present value, has been deposited. Tenn. Code \\u00a7 6893. Moreover, the death or remarriage of respondent, plus the death or attainment of the age of eighteen by the children, would terminate all payments. Tenn. Code \\u00a7 6883. Since an award to respondent would be payable in installments, and by operation of conditions subsequent the total payments might never reach $3,000, the Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the jurisdictional amount was lacking.\\nIf this case were one where judgment could be entered only for the installments due at the commencement of the suit (cf. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Viglas, 297 U. S. 672, 678), future installments could not be considered in determining whether the jurisdictional amount was involved, even though the judgment would be determinative of liability for future installments as they accrued. Wright v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 19 F. 2d 117, aff\\u2019d. 276 U. S. 602. Cf. Button v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 48 F. Supp. 168. But this is not that type of case. For the Tennessee statute which creates liability for the award contemplates a single action for the determination of claimant\\u2019s right to benefits and a single judgment for the award granted. See Tenn. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 6880, 6881, 6890, 6891, 6893; Shockley v. Morristown Produce & Ice Co., 171 Tenn. 591, 106 S.W. 2d 562.\\nNor does the fact that it cannot be known as a matter of absolute certainty that the amount which may ultimately be paid, if respondent prevails, will exceed $3,000, mean that the jurisdictional amount is lacking. This Court has rejected such a restrictive interpretation of the statute creating diversity jurisdiction. It has held that a possibility that payments will terminate before the total reaches the jurisdictional minimum is immaterial if the right to all the payments is in issue. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra; Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551. Future payments are not in any proper sense contingent, although they may be decreased or cut off altogether by the operation of conditions subsequent. Thompson v. Thompson, supra, p. 560. And there is no suggestion that by reason of life expectancy or law of averages the maximum amount recoverable can be expected to fall below the jurisdictional minimum. Cf. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra, p. 101. Moreover, the computation of the maximum amount recoverable is not complicated by the necessity of determining the life expectancy of respondent. Cf. Thompson v. Thompson, supra, p. 559; Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra, p. 100.\\nThird. Respondent, as is her right, United States v. Ballard, 322 U. S. 78, 88, and cases cited, seeks to support the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals on other grounds. But those questions were not passed upon by that court nor adequately presented here. So we deem it more appropriate to remand the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals so it may consider those questions. United States v. Ballard, supra.\\nReversed.\\nDeath benefits are provided in the amount of 60% of the average weekly wages of the employee (as computed in accordance with Tenn. Code \\u00a7 6852 (c)), but payments may not exceed $18 per week, nor continue for more than 400 weeks. \\u00a76880; \\u00a7 6883 (17). In addition there is a ceiling of $5,000 on total benefits exclusive of burial and certain other expenses. \\u00a7 6881. See Haynes v. Columbia Pictures Corp., 178 Tenn. 648, 162 S. W. 2d 383. The complaint alleged that 60% of the average weekly wages for the statutory period would exceed $5,000.\\nThe contention was that proper venue lay only in Roane County where, it was alleged, the accident occurred and the business of the employer is conducted. It was argued that service on the insurer in Hawkins County did not give the Hawkins County Court jurisdiction of the case.\\nSee note 1, supra.\"\n",

      "                \"JONES, Circuit Judge.\\nThe appellant and cross-appellee, plainest below, was an employee of W. Horace Williams Company, Inc. The employer was doing a construction job in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. The appellant was fireman of a boiler at the construction site. He rated his job as being heavy and strenuous. The appel-lee and cross-appellant, his employer, put the job on about the level of that of watchman. On September 9, 1952, while on the job, the appellant accidently sustained a fracture of the patella of his left knee. His leg was in a cast for nine weeks and one day. From the middle of June, 1953, to early April, 1954, the appellant worked at a couple of jobs, one of which he lost because his experience did not qualify him for it, and he was discharged from the second because he did not turn out enough work. From April 4, 1954, or thereabouts, he has been operating a business on his own account selling and repairing electrical equipment. He was paid workmen\\u2019s compensation benefits of $1,170.00 during his convalescence. Upon the termination of compensation payments the appellant sued the employer and its workmen's compensation insurer in the 25th Judicial District Court, St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, claiming that total and permanent disability entitled him to compensation for 400 weeks at the rate of $30.00 per week, subject to a credit of $1,170.00 already paid. Removal to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, based on diversity of citizenship, followed.\\nThe pertinent portions of the Louisiana Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Act are as-follows:\\n\\u201cCompensation shall be paid under this Chapter in accordance with the following schedule of payments:\\n\\u201c (1) For injdry producing temporary total disability to do work of any reasonable character, sixty-five per centum of wages during the period of disability, not beyond three hundred weeks.\\n\\u201c(2) For injury producing permanent total disability to do work of any reasonable character, sixty-five per centum of wages during the period of disability, not beyond four hundred weeks.\\n\\u201c(3) For injury producing partial disability to do work of any reasonable character, sixty-five per centum of the difference between wages at the time of injury and wages which the injured employee is able to earn thereafter during the period of disability, not beyond three hundred weeks.\\n\\u201c(4) In the following cases the compensation shall be as follows:\\n\\u2022Jv *\\n\\u201c(h) For the loss of a leg, sixty-five per centum of wages during one hundred seventy-five weeks. ******\\n\\u201c(n) A permanent total loss of the use of a member is equivalent to the amputation of the member.\\n\\u201c(o) In all cases involving a permanent partial loss of the use or function of the members mentioned hereinabove, compensation shall bear such proportion to the amounts named herein for the total loss of such members as the disability to such members bears to the total loss of the member, provided that in no case shall compensation for an injury to a member exceed the compensation payable for the loss of .such member.\\u201d\\nLouisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 23, \\u00a7 1221, LSA.\\n\\u201cWhere compensation has been paid under subdivisions (1), (2), or (3), of R.S. 23:1221, the amount of such payment shall be deducted from any compensation allowed under subdivision (4) thereof or under Sub-part C of this Part.\\u201d\\nLouisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 23, \\u00a7 1223, LSA.\\n\\u201cA judgment of compensation may be modified by subsequent agreement between the parties, with the approval of a judge of the court which rendered the same.\\n\\u201cAt any time six months after the rendition of a judgment of compensation, a judge of the trial court that rendered the judgment shall review the same upon the application of either party for a modification thereof, on the grounds that the incapacity of the employee has been subsequently diminished or increased, or that the judgment was obtained through error, fraud, or misrepresentation.\\u201d\\nLouisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 23, \\u00a7 1331, LSA.\\nThe case was tried to the court without a jury. Much testimony was taken and there were many conflicts as to disability vel non, the nature of the injuries sustained, their duration, the treatment required, and the extent to which it was followed. The court found that the appellant was not disabled within the meaning of the Act, and hence not entitled to recover under LSA-R.S. 23:-1221(1), (2), or (3). The court held, however, that appellant had a one-third partial loss of the use or function of his leg for which appellant was entitled to compensation under LSA-R.S. 23:1221 (4) (h) and (o). Judgment was entered for benefits of $30.00 per week for fifty-eight and one-third weeks, an aggregate of $1,750.00 upon which was to be credited the $1,170.00 previously paid. Thus the net award was $580.00.\\nFollowing the judgment for an amount which the appellant deemed inadequate, he moved to remand the case to the state court contending that the matter in controversy does not exceed $3,000.00. The motion was denied. The appellant brought this appeal asserting, in addition to the jurisdictional question, that he was entitled to compensation for either total permanent disability or total temporary disability. The employer and the insurer took a cross-appeal and urge that the loss of partial use by plaintiff of his leg was due to his failure to cooperate in the treatment prescribed, and also that in any event the loss of use was not over twenty, or, at the most, twenty-five per cent.\\nThe argument against Federal jurisdiction is based upon the language of the Louisiana Act upon which the appellant based his claim. The statute permits recovery \\u201cduring the * * * disability, not beyond four hundred weeks.\\u201d LSA-R.S. 23:1221(2). And it is provided that at any time after six months after the rendition of judgment it may be reviewed on application of either party on the grounds that the employee\\u2019s incapacity has been diminished or increased. So, it is said, the maximum amount involved is the accrual to the date of judgment and the amount of the award for six months thereafter. This is the rule adopted by the District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. The rule and the reason for it have been set forth in these words:\\n\\u201cOf course, if plaintiff should sustain his claim in full, and should remain permanently disabled, he would be entitled to receive a total of $5,408 over a period of 400 weeks or eight weeks less than four years. However, under the state statute (Sec. 20), the matter can be reopened at intervals of six months, and if the employee has fully recovered, payments can be stopped altogether. The parties may, also, with the approval of the court in which the action is brought, settle the entire liability in a lump sum, the amount of which might or might not be within the jurisdiction of this court. [Citing cases.] * * * Therefore, all that a judgment in a case of this kind can settle is that, at the time it is rendered, the plaintiff has suffered injuries through his employment, amounting to total disability, probably permanent, which entitle him to receive stated weekly wages for a period of six months or approximately 26 weeks. In this case at the rate claimed this would amount to about $350.\\u201d Godfrey v. Brown Paper Mill Co., Inc., D.C., 52 F.Supp. 926.\\nThe Godfrey decision was followed by the court rendering it in Guidry v. J. Ray McDermott Co., Inc., D.C., 89 F.Supp. 60. The contrary rule has prevailed in the Eastern District of Louisiana where jurisdiction has been taken and retained in workmen\\u2019s compensation cases under the Louisiana Act. Butler v. Employers Mut. of Wausau, Wis., D. C., 105 F.Supp. 105; Boyd v. R. P. Farnsworth & Co., D.C., 105 F.Supp. 113. The District Court for the District of New Jersey had before it a question involving the Louisiana Act. There a plaintiff asserted that she, as widow and sole dependent of an employee who was fatally injured while employed, was entitled to weekly payments of $14.30 for 300 weeks. The statute provided that \\u201c \\u2018The marriage or death of any dependent shall terminate payments to such dependent, * * *.\\u2019 \\u201d The court sustained jurisdiction, saying:\\n\\u201cIn the State of Louisiana a judgment for weekly payments under the Liability Act until death or remarriage of the plaintiff is erroneous. Laurent v. Dendinger, 13 La.App. 234, 126 So. 600, 127 So. 755. A proper judgment is for the payment of these benefits for the full period of 300 weeks. Smith v. Samuel T. Gately Marble & Granite Works, La. App., 157 So. 802. And the fact that a condition subsequent \\u2014 marriage or death \\u2014 will operate as a forfeiture of future benefits, and, hence, lessen the amount ultimately to be paid, is immaterial. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, 293 U.S. 96, 55 S.Ct. 1, 79 L.Ed. 219.\\u201d Franzen v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., D.C., 36 F.Supp. 375, 377.\\nThe Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit approved the opinion of the District Court from which we have quoted. Franzen v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 146 F.2d 837.\\nA like case \\u00e1rese under similar provisions of the Tennessee Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review a direction to remand for want of jurisdictional amount. It had been held by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 6 Cir., 154 F.2d 881 that since the award payable in installments subject to conditions subsequent the total payments might never reach $3,000, the jurisdictional amount was lacking. In reaching a contrary conclusion the Supreme Court said:\\n\\u201cIf this case were one where judgment could be entered only for the installments due at the commencement of the suit (cf. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Viglas, 297 U. S. 672, 678, 56 S.Ct. 615, 617, 80 L. Ed. 971), future installments could not be considered in determining whether the jurisdictional amount was involved, even though the judgment would be determinative of liability for future installments as they accrued. Wright v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 19 F.2d 117, affirmed 276 U.S. 602, 48 S.Ct. 323, 72 L.Ed. 726. Cf. Button v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., D.C., 48 F.Supp. 168. But this is not that type of case. For the Tennessee statute which creates liability for the award contemplates a single action for the determination of claimant\\u2019s right to benefits and a single judgment for the award granted. See Tenn. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 6880, 6881, 6890, 6891, 6893; Shockley v. Morristown Produce & Ice Co., 171 Tenn. 591, 106 S.W.2d 562.\\n\\u201cNor does the fact that it cannot be known as a matter of absolute certainty that the amount which may ultimately be paid, if respondent prevails, will exceed $3,000, mean that the jurisdictional amount is lacking. This Court has rejected such a restrictive interpretation of the statute creating diversity jurisdiction. It has held that a possibility that payments will terminate before the total reaches the jurisdictional minimum is immaterial if the right to all the payments is in issue. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra [293 U.S. 96, 55 S.Ct. 1, 79 L.Ed. 219] ; Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551, 33 S.Ct. 129, 57 L.Ed. 347. Future payments are not in any proper sense contingent, although they may be decreased or cut off altogether by the operation of conditions subsequent. Thompson v. Thompson, supra, 226 U.S. at page 560, 33 S.Ct. 130. And there is no suggestion that by reason of life expectancy or law of averages the maximum amount recoverable can be expected to fall below the jurisdictional minimum. Cf. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra, 293 U.S. at page 101, 55 S.Ct. 2. Moreover, the computation of the maximum amount recoverable is not complicated by the necessity of determining the life expectancy of respondent. Cf. Thompson v. Thompson, supra, 226 U.S. at page 559, 33 S.Ct. 130; Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra, 293 U.S. at page 100, 55 S.Ct. 2.\\u201d Aetna Casualty Co. v. Flowers, 330 U.S. 464, 67 S.Ct. 798, 800, 91 L. Ed. 1024, reversing 6 Cir., 154 F.2d 881.\\nThe appellant would distinguish the Franzen v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., supra, and Aetna Casualty Co. v. Flowers, supra, cases on the ground that they are for death benefits payable to a dependent upon whose death payments would cease, rather than, as here, for disability benefits which would decrease or terminate if the employee\\u2019s disability diminished or vanished. We cannot make such distinction. We think Aetna Casualty Co. v. Flowers, supra, is controlling. The reasoning of the Supreme Court is no less applicable to the case before us than to the case reviewed and decided by it. If the condition subsequent of death, which is certain, does not restrict jurisdiction, the uncertain condition of a diminishing of incapacity will not do so. We conclude that the requirement of the federal jurisdictional amount was met.\\nThe parties are in agreement that the test of \\u201cdisability\\u201d is whether the employee can do the same type of work he was doing at the time of his accident in the customary way without any unusual difficulty or pain. Knispel v. Gulf States Utilities Co., Inc., 174 La. 401, 141 So. 9; Fisher v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., La.App., 28 So.2d 59. Ample proof supported the finding of disability.\\nThere is no question but that an injured employee is not entitled to compensation during a period while his recovery is prevented or delayed by his own act or conduct. Brown v. Union Oil Mill, Inc., La.App., 59 So.2d 144, and cases there cited. Evidence adduced by the appellees indicated that the appellant had failed to follow prescribed treatments which, appellees urge, would have hastened his recovery and assured his ultimate full recovery. The appellant has raised doubts as to the necessity or wisdom of the suggested treatment. This was for the trial court\\u2019s determination and has been determined, inferentially, by it. The appellees, in their cross-appeal, specify as error the failure of the trial court to make a specific finding of fact on the cooperation issue. As to the necessity for such a finding we find it stated that:\\n\\u201cThe federal rule relating to findings of a trial court does not require the court to make findings on all facts presented or to make detailed evidentiary findings; if the findings are sufficient to support the ultimate conclusion of the court they are sufficient. * * * Nor is it necessary that the trial court make findings asserting the negative of each issue of fact raised. * * * The ultimate test as to the adequacy of findings will always be whether they are sufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues to provide a basis for decision and whether they are supported by the evidence.\\u201d Carr v. Yokohama Specie Bank, Limited, 9 Cir., 200 F.2d 251, 255.\\nThe language above, was quoted with approval by this court in Weber v. McKee, 215 F.2d 447. The failure to include a finding of whether the appellant interfered with his own progress to recovery is not error.\\nWe need not enter upon any discussion of the evidentiary facts or consider the conflicts of the evidence. It is enough to say that the findings of the trial court are supported by adequate proof. It was found that there was a 25% to 33%% impairment of the use of appellant\\u2019s leg. The trial court was under a duty to construe the statute and the testimony liberally in favor of the appellant and give him the benefit of any doubt. Jones v. Hunsicker, 188 La. 468, 177 So. 576. The trial court, in fixing the measure of the award, did not err.\\nThe judgment is Affirmed.\"\n",

Pursuant to the Texas Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law, petitioner filed a claim with the Texas Industrial Accident Board against his employer and the respondent insurance company alleging that he had been totally and permanently incapacitated and claiming the maximum recovery under the law of $35 per week for 401 weeks, or a total of $14,035. After administrative hearings the Board decided that petitioner would be disabled for only 30 weeks and accordingly made an award of only $1,050. Section 5 of Art. 8307 of the Texas Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law permits either the employee or the insurance company, if dissatisfied with an award, to \\u201cbring suit in the county where the injury occurred to set aside said final ruling,\\u201d in which event the issues shall be determined \\u201cupon trial de novo, and the burden or [sic] proof shall be upon the party claiming compensation,\\u201d but in no event shall the court allow recovery in excess of the statutory maximum of $14,035. Acting under this provision of state law, the respondent, on April 30, 1959, the very day of the award, filed this diversity case in the United States District Court to set aside the award, alleging that petitioner had claimed, was claiming and would claim $14,035, but denying that petitioner was entitled to recover anything at all under Texas law. One week later the petitioner, who also was dissatisfied with the award, filed an action in the state court to set aside the Board\\u2019s award and to recover in that court the full $14,035. After that, petitioner moved to dismiss the respondent\\u2019s federal court suit on the ground that the value of the \\u201cmatter in controversy\\u201d was only the amount of the award, $1,050, and not the amount of his claim of $14,035, although he also contemporaneously filed, subject to his motion to dismiss, what he designated as a compulsory counterclaim for the full amount he had claimed before the Texas Board and in his Texas State Court suit. The District Court held that the \\u201cmatter in controversy\\u201d in the federal action was only the amount of the $1,050 award that the respondent company had asked the court to set aside. In so holding the District Court relied on National Surety Cory. v. Chamberlain, in which another District Court in Texas had reached the same conclusion as to jurisdiction largely on the basis of what it deemed to have been the purpose of Congress in enacting the 1958 amendment to 28 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1332, which amendment rather severely cut down the jurisdiction of Federal District Courts, particularly in state workmen\\u2019s compensation cases. The Court of Appeals reversed, and we granted certiorari to decide the'important jurisdictional questions raised under the 1958 amendment.\\nFor reasons to be stated, we hold that the District Court has jurisdiction of the controversy.\\nFirst. It is true, as the Chamberlain opinion pointed out, that the purpose and effect of the 1958 amendment were to reduce congestion in the Federal District Courts partially caused by the large number of civil cases that were being brought under the long-standing $3,000 jurisdictional rule. This effort to reduce District Court congestion followed years of study by the United States Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, as well as by the Congress. To accomplish this purpose the 1958 amendment took several different but related steps. It raised the requisite jurisdictional amount from $3,000 to $10,000 in diversity and federal question cases; it provided that a corporation is to be deemed a citizen not only of the State by which it was incorporated but also of the State where it has its principal place of business; and, most importantly here, it also for the first time forbade the removal of state workmen\\u2019s compensation cases from state courts to United States District Courts. By granting district judges a discretionary power to impose costs on a federal court plaintiff if he should \\u201crecover less than the sum or value of $10,000,\\u201d the amendment further manifested a congressional purpose to discourage the trying of suits involving less than $10,000 in federal courts. In discussing the question of state workmen\\u2019s compensation cases, the Senate Report on the amendment evidenced a concern not only about the problem of congestion in the federal courts, but also about trial burdens that claimants might suffer by having to go to trial in federal rather than state courts due to the fact that the state courts are likely to be closer to an injured worker\\u2019s home and may also provide him with special procedural advantages in workmen\\u2019s compensation cases.\\nThe foregoing are some of the appealing considerations that led the District Court to conclude that it would frustrate the congressional purpose to permit insurers to file workmen\\u2019s compensation suits in federal courts when Congress had deliberately provided that such suits could not be removed to federal courts if filed by claimants in state courts. But after the most deliberate study of the whole problem by lawyers and judges and after its consideration by lawyers on the Senate Judiciary Committee in the light of statistics on both removals and original filings, Congress used language specifically barring removal of such cases from state to federal courts and at the same time left unchanged the old language which just as specifically permits civil suits to be filed in federal courts in cases where there are both diversity of citizenship and the prescribed jurisdictional amount. In this situation we must take the intent of Congress with regard to the filing of diversity cases in Federal District Courts to be that which its language clearly sets forth. Congress could very easily have used language to bar filing of workmen\\u2019s compensation suits by the insurer as well as removal of such suits, and it could easily do so still. We therefore hold that under the present law the District Court has jurisdiction to try this civil case between citizens of different States if the matter in controversy is in excess of $10,000.\\nSecond. We agree with petitioner that determination of the value of the matter in controversy for purposes of federal jurisdiction is a federal question to be decided under federal standards, although the federal courts must, of course, look to state law to determine the nature and extent of the right to be enforced in a diversity case. It therefore is not controlling here that Texas has held that the crucial factor for allocating its cases among different state courts on an amount-in-controversy basis is the amount originally claimed before its State Compensation Board.\\nThe general federal rule has long been to decide what the amount in controversy is from the complaint itself, unless it appears or is in some way shown that the amount stated in the complaint is not claimed \\u201cin good faith.\\u201d In deciding this question of good faith we have said that it \\u201cmust appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal.\\u201d The complaint of the respondent company filed in the District Court, while denying any liability at all and asking that the award of $1,050 against it be set aside, also alleges that petitioner Horton has claimed, now claims and will claim that he has suffered total and permanent disability and is entitled to a maximum recovery of $14,035, which, of course, is in excess of the $10,000 requisite to give a federal court jurisdiction of this controversy. No denial of these allegations in the complaint has been made, no attempted disclaimer or surrender of any part of the original claim has been made by petitioner, and there has been no other showing, let alone a showing \\u201cto a legal certainty,\\u201d of any lack of good faith on the part of the respondent in alleging that a $14,035 claim is in controversy. It would contradict the whole record as well as the allegations of the complaint to say that this dispute involves only $1,050. The claim before the Board was $14,035; the state court suit of petitioner asked that much; the conditional counterclaim in the federal court claims the same amount. Texas law under which this claim was created and has its being leaves the entire $14,035 claim open for adjudication in a de novo court trial, regardless of the award. Thus the record before us shows beyond a doubt that the award is challenged by both parties and is binding on neither; that petitioner claims more than $10,000 from the respondent and the respondent denies it should have to pay petitioner anything at all. No matter which party brings it into court, the controversy remains the same; it involves the same amount of money and is to be adjudicated and determined under the same rules. Unquestionably, therefore, the amount in controversy is in excess of $10,000.\\nThird. Petitioner contends, however, that even though the amount in controversy is more than $10,000, the suit filed by the company is nothing more than an appeal from a state administrative order, that a Federal District Court has no appellate jurisdiction and that the dismissal of the case by the District Court therefore is supportable on that ground. This contention rests almost entirely on Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Stude, 346 U. S. 574, 581, which held that a United States District Court was without jurisdiction to consider an appeal \\u201ctaken administratively or judicially in a state proceeding.\\u201d Aside from many other relevant distinctions which need not be pointed out, the Stude case is without weight here because, as shown by the Texas Supreme Court\\u2019s interpretation of its compensation act:\\n\\u201cThe suit to set aside an award of the board is in fact a suit, not an appeal. It is filed as any other suit is filed and when filed the subject matter is withdrawn from the board.\\u201d\\nIt is true that as conditions precedent to filing a suit a claim must have been filed with the Board and the Board must have made a final ruling and decision. But the trial in court is not an appellate proceeding. It is a trial de novo wholly without reference to what may have been decided by the Board.\\nThe Court of Appeals was right in holding that the District Court had jurisdiction of this case and its judgment is\\nAffirmed.\\nAct of July 25, 1958, 72 Stat. 415.\\nVernon\\u2019s Tex Ann.

W. 2d 322, 328.\\nThe character of the lawsuit is further illuminated by decisions of the Texas Supreme Court holding that the administrative award becomes vacated and unenforceable once the court has acquired jurisdiction of the cause and the parties even if a voluntary nonsuit is taken and the case dismissed without judgment on the merits. Zurich General Accident Co. v. Rodgers, 128 Tex. 313, 97 S. W. 2d 674; Texas Reciprocal Ins. Assn. v. Leger, 128 Tex. 319, 97 S. W. 2d 677. This makes it all the more clear that the matter in controversy between the parties to the suit is not merely whether the award will be set aside since the suit automatically sets it aside for determination of liability de novo.\"\n",

Make your answer concise, and avoid redundant languages and assumptions. Below is what I have written so far:\\n\\nR. DORSEY WATKINS, District Judge.\\nThis is a suit by the plaintiffs (hereinafter Nelson and Smith) against the defendant, their employer (hereinafter Victory) to recover moneys allegedly due and to become due under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into on June 25, 1959 between United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (hereinafter Union) and Victory. This agreement provided that Victory would \\u201ccarry an excess compensation policy on his employees when they are working outside of the District of Columbia which shall give the employees * * * additional compensation in Maryland and Virginia equal to that of the District of Columbia.\\u201d\\nThe underlying facts have all been stipulated.\\nNelson and Smith, while employed by Victory and while working for Victory, sustained accidental personal injuries \\u25a0arising out of and in the course of their \\u25a0employment. Each received an award from the State Industrial Accident Commission, under which (to October 29, 1963):\\nNelson had received under the Maryland Award:\\nTemporary total disability $ 880.00\\nTemporary partial disability 200.00\\nPermanent partial disability 1,875.00\\n$2,955.00\\nUnder the District of Columbia Compensation Act, his compensation would have been:\\nTemporary total disability $1,188.00\\nTemporary partial disability 200.00\\nPermanent partial disability\\n($15.00 a week from April 25,\\n1961 to October 29, 1963) 1,965.00\\n$3,353.00\\nPlus \\u201cexcess benefits\\u201d payable at $15.00 per week, or $780.00 per year, until a total of $17,280 is paid. Nelson is fifty-\\u25a0eight years old and has a life expectancy\\nof nineteen years, or $14,280 based on life expectancy. Smith had received under the Maryland award:\\nTemporary total disability $ 640.00\\nPermanent partial disability 3,125.00\\n$3,765.00\\nUnder the District of Columbia Compensation Act, his compensation would have been:\\nTemporary total disability $ 864.00\\nPermanent partial disability ($25.00 per week from November 21,1960 to October 29, 1963) 3,825.00\\n$4,689.00\\nPlus \\u201cexcess benefits\\u201d payable at $25.00 per week, or $1,300.00 per year, until a total of $17,280.00 is paid. Smith is forty-six years old and has a life ex-pectaney of twenty-seven years.\\nJurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship, Nelson and Smith being residents and citizens of the District of Columbia, and Victory being a corporation with its principal place of business in Louisiana, but which had been doing business in Maryland. The \\u201ccontract\\u201d allegedly involved related to performance within the State of Maryland. It is alleged that the amount in controversy, as to each of Nelson and Smith, exceeds $10,000, exclusive of interests and costs.\\nService was purportedly made upon Victory through the State Department of Assessment and Taxation of the State of Maryland. Victory moved to dismiss on the ground that at the time suit was instituted Victory had ceased to do business in the State of Maryland. The motion was denied by Judge Edward S. Northrop, on the basis of Chief Judge Roszel C. Thomsen\\u2019s opinion in L\\u2019Hereux v. Central American Airways Flying Service, Inc., D.Md.1962, 209 F.Supp. 713, and on the ground of waiver, with both of which opinions this judge is in accord.\\nVictory then answered, raising as defenses that if there were an agreement as alleged, it was contrary to Article 101, section 52 of the Maryland Code of Public General Laws; and that the Union agreement, if executed, was not binding upon it.\\n1. Section 51 provides in pertinent part as follows:\\n\\u201cNo employer or employee who is subject to the provisions of this article shall exempt himself from the burden or waive the benefit of this article by any contract, agreement, rule or regulation, and any such contract, agreement, rule or regulation shall be pro tanto void.\\u201d\\nThe argument in substance is that one of the benefits of Article 101 to the employer is the provision of section 15 that the liability to pay compensation according to the schedules \\u201cis exclusive.\\u201d However, section 51 would not appear to prevent the employer, by agreement independent of, and outside of the provisions of Article 101 from complementing or supplementing the Compensation Act as to the total sums recoverable or receivable.\\nThe dictum, if not the express holding, in Baltimore Transit Company v. Har-roll, 1958, 217 Md. 169, 141 A.2d 912, strongly supports the position of Nelson and Smith. In the Harroll case an employee had sought to recover medical and hospital expenses allegedly payable under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, and prevailed in the lower court. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that where plaintiff had first received compensation benefits, then settled his claim against the negligent third party, out of which settlement the insurer of the employer had been repaid the compensation, plus the amount of hospital and doctor\\u2019s bills it had paid plaintiff, he could not recover the hospital and doctor\\u2019s bills on the theory that such medical care had been furnished under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. The court said (217 Md. at 177, 141 A.2d at 916):\\n\\u201cWe cannot read Article 17 as requiring the company to pay over to an employee the hospital and medical expenses it has received from a tortfeasor. If the parties had so intended and had clearly expressed that intent, they could have agreed that any such expenses recouped by the employer and made his by the statute, must be given by him to the injured employee, but the provisions of Article 17 fall far short of such an agreement, as we read them.\\u201d\\nHowever, the court recognized the validity of the supplementation of benefits under the Act, saying (217 Md. at 173-174, 141 A.2d at 914) :\\n\\u201cThere are significant indications that Article 17 of the agreement was to complement the compensation act and not to supplement or supplant it in any respect. It would be entirely competent for the parties by express contract to supplement the benefits under the Act or to relax its restrictions or requirements in favor of the employees. 2 Larson, Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law, Sec. 97.61; Sharp v. Foley Brothers, Sup., 69 N.Y.S.2d 514.\\u201d\\nThe Harroll case is construed as follows in 23 M.L.E. Workmen\\u2019s Compensation \\u00a7 181:\\n\\u201cAccordingly, as a general rule, an employee may not, by an agreement, waive rights given under the Act, or waive a claim for compensation before the disability takes place. However, it is entirely competent for an employer and an employee by express contract to supplement benefits under the Act or to relax its restrictions or requirements in favor of the employee.\\u201d\\nThe first defense is accordingly without merit.\\n2. The Union agreement was signed on behalf of Victory by its Project Manager in charge of Victory\\u2019s work at the job site in Maryland. It was stipulated that the Vice President and General Counsel of Victory, if a witness, would testify that the signature of the Union agreement was without the knowledge and consent of the officers and directors of Victory; that no resolution was ever passed by the officers or directors of Victory authorizing or ratifying the agreement; that it was the custom for Victory to subcontract work of the type done by Nelson and Smith; that before the contract in question, Victory had never signed any contracts with any \\u201cexcess compensation benefits\\u201d such as the contract in question; and that Victory had always hired only union employees.\\nIt was also stipulated that Victory paid wages to its carpenter-employees (including Nelson and Smith) in accordance with the wage rates in the agreement, which were those prevailing in the District of Columbia and higher than those prevailing at the work site; that Victory made contributions to the Health and Welfare Fund in accordance with Article VII, Section 17 of the Agreement ; and that Victory abided by all other working conditions of the agreement.\\nIt was further stipulated that the Project Manager had authority to hire and fire employees at the job site; and that he communicated with officials of the Union for the purpose of employing carpenters on the job and that thereafter Nelson, Smith and other union carpenters were employed on the job.\\nSince the Project Manager had authority to hire and fire, and since he could hire only union carpenters , he would have at least apparent authority to execute the agreement necessary for their employment. Brager v. Levy, 1914, 122 Md. 554, 560, 90 A. 102; 2 Am.Jur.

We cannot make such distinction. We think Aetna Casualty Co. v. Flowers, supra, is controlling. The reasoning of the Supreme Court is no less applicable to the case before us than to the case reviewed and decided by it.

      "        \"previous_text\": \"R. DORSEY WATKINS, District Judge.\\nThis is a suit by the plaintiffs (hereinafter Nelson and Smith) against the defendant, their employer (hereinafter Victory) to recover moneys allegedly due and to become due under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into on June 25, 1959 between United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (hereinafter Union) and Victory. This agreement provided that Victory would \\u201ccarry an excess compensation policy on his employees when they are working outside of the District of Columbia which shall give the employees * * * additional compensation in Maryland and Virginia equal to that of the District of Columbia.\\u201d\\nThe underlying facts have all been stipulated.\\nNelson and Smith, while employed by Victory and while working for Victory, sustained accidental personal injuries \\u25a0arising out of and in the course of their \\u25a0employment. Each received an award from the State Industrial Accident Commission, under which (to October 29, 1963):\\nNelson had received under the Maryland Award:\\nTemporary total disability $ 880.00\\nTemporary partial disability 200.00\\nPermanent partial disability 1,875.00\\n$2,955.00\\nUnder the District of Columbia Compensation Act, his compensation would have been:\\nTemporary total disability $1,188.00\\nTemporary partial disability 200.00\\nPermanent partial disability\\n($15.00 a week from April 25,\\n1961 to October 29, 1963) 1,965.00\\n$3,353.00\\nPlus \\u201cexcess benefits\\u201d payable at $15.00 per week, or $780.00 per year, until a total of $17,280 is paid. Nelson is fifty-\\u25a0eight years old and has a life expectancy\\nof nineteen years, or $14,280 based on life expectancy. Smith had received under the Maryland award:\\nTemporary total disability $ 640.00\\nPermanent partial disability 3,125.00\\n$3,765.00\\nUnder the District of Columbia Compensation Act, his compensation would have been:\\nTemporary total disability $ 864.00\\nPermanent partial disability ($25.00 per week from November 21,1960 to October 29, 1963) 3,825.00\\n$4,689.00\\nPlus \\u201cexcess benefits\\u201d payable at $25.00 per week, or $1,300.00 per year, until a total of $17,280.00 is paid. Smith is forty-six years old and has a life ex-pectaney of twenty-seven years.\\nJurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship, Nelson and Smith being residents and citizens of the District of Columbia, and Victory being a corporation with its principal place of business in Louisiana, but which had been doing business in Maryland. The \\u201ccontract\\u201d allegedly involved related to performance within the State of Maryland. It is alleged that the amount in controversy, as to each of Nelson and Smith, exceeds $10,000, exclusive of interests and costs.\\nService was purportedly made upon Victory through the State Department of Assessment and Taxation of the State of Maryland. Victory moved to dismiss on the ground that at the time suit was instituted Victory had ceased to do business in the State of Maryland. The motion was denied by Judge Edward S. Northrop, on the basis of Chief Judge Roszel C. Thomsen\\u2019s opinion in L\\u2019Hereux v. Central American Airways Flying Service, Inc., D.Md.1962, 209 F.Supp. 713, and on the ground of waiver, with both of which opinions this judge is in accord.\\nVictory then answered, raising as defenses that if there were an agreement as alleged, it was contrary to Article 101, section 52 of the Maryland Code of Public General Laws; and that the Union agreement, if executed, was not binding upon it.\\n1. Section 51 provides in pertinent part as follows:\\n\\u201cNo employer or employee who is subject to the provisions of this article shall exempt himself from the burden or waive the benefit of this article by any contract, agreement, rule or regulation, and any such contract, agreement, rule or regulation shall be pro tanto void.\\u201d\\nThe argument in substance is that one of the benefits of Article 101 to the employer is the provision of section 15 that the liability to pay compensation according to the schedules \\u201cis exclusive.\\u201d However, section 51 would not appear to prevent the employer, by agreement independent of, and outside of the provisions of Article 101 from complementing or supplementing the Compensation Act as to the total sums recoverable or receivable.\\nThe dictum, if not the express holding, in Baltimore Transit Company v. Har-roll, 1958, 217 Md. 169, 141 A.2d 912, strongly supports the position of Nelson and Smith. In the Harroll case an employee had sought to recover medical and hospital expenses allegedly payable under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, and prevailed in the lower court. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that where plaintiff had first received compensation benefits, then settled his claim against the negligent third party, out of which settlement the insurer of the employer had been repaid the compensation, plus the amount of hospital and doctor\\u2019s bills it had paid plaintiff, he could not recover the hospital and doctor\\u2019s bills on the theory that such medical care had been furnished under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. The court said (217 Md. at 177, 141 A.2d at 916):\\n\\u201cWe cannot read Article 17 as requiring the company to pay over to an employee the hospital and medical expenses it has received from a tortfeasor. If the parties had so intended and had clearly expressed that intent, they could have agreed that any such expenses recouped by the employer and made his by the statute, must be given by him to the injured employee, but the provisions of Article 17 fall far short of such an agreement, as we read them.\\u201d\\nHowever, the court recognized the validity of the supplementation of benefits under the Act, saying (217 Md. at 173-174, 141 A.2d at 914) :\\n\\u201cThere are significant indications that Article 17 of the agreement was to complement the compensation act and not to supplement or supplant it in any respect. It would be entirely competent for the parties by express contract to supplement the benefits under the Act or to relax its restrictions or requirements in favor of the employees. 2 Larson, Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law, Sec. 97.61; Sharp v. Foley Brothers, Sup., 69 N.Y.S.2d 514.\\u201d\\nThe Harroll case is construed as follows in 23 M.L.E. Workmen\\u2019s Compensation \\u00a7 181:\\n\\u201cAccordingly, as a general rule, an employee may not, by an agreement, waive rights given under the Act, or waive a claim for compensation before the disability takes place. However, it is entirely competent for an employer and an employee by express contract to supplement benefits under the Act or to relax its restrictions or requirements in favor of the employee.\\u201d\\nThe first defense is accordingly without merit.\\n2. The Union agreement was signed on behalf of Victory by its Project Manager in charge of Victory\\u2019s work at the job site in Maryland. It was stipulated that the Vice President and General Counsel of Victory, if a witness, would testify that the signature of the Union agreement was without the knowledge and consent of the officers and directors of Victory; that no resolution was ever passed by the officers or directors of Victory authorizing or ratifying the agreement; that it was the custom for Victory to subcontract work of the type done by Nelson and Smith; that before the contract in question, Victory had never signed any contracts with any \\u201cexcess compensation benefits\\u201d such as the contract in question; and that Victory had always hired only union employees.\\nIt was also stipulated that Victory paid wages to its carpenter-employees (including Nelson and Smith) in accordance with the wage rates in the agreement, which were those prevailing in the District of Columbia and higher than those prevailing at the work site; that Victory made contributions to the Health and Welfare Fund in accordance with Article VII, Section 17 of the Agreement ; and that Victory abided by all other working conditions of the agreement.\\nIt was further stipulated that the Project Manager had authority to hire and fire employees at the job site; and that he communicated with officials of the Union for the purpose of employing carpenters on the job and that thereafter Nelson, Smith and other union carpenters were employed on the job.\\nSince the Project Manager had authority to hire and fire, and since he could hire only union carpenters , he would have at least apparent authority to execute the agreement necessary for their employment. Brager v. Levy, 1914, 122 Md. 554, 560, 90 A. 102; 2 Am.Jur. Agency, section 348; 3 Am.Jur.2d, Agency, section 263.\\nMoreover, the payment of wages in accordance with those prescribed in the Union agreement, and the payments into the Union Health and Welfare Fund, in addition to wages, would be waiver, or constitute an estoppel or a ratification (Southern Industries, Inc. v. United States, 9 Cir. 1964, 326 F.2d 221), as to the authority of the Project Manager.\\nThe second defense is accordingly without merit.\\nThe complaint asked for judgment in favor of Nelson for all accrued payments for temporary total, temporary partial and permanent partial disability, and an order that future payments be made to him at the rate of $15.00 per week during the continuance of his permanent partial disability or until the sum of $17,280.00 be paid; and in favor of Smith for all accrued payments for temporary total and permanent partial disability, and an order that future payments be made at the rate of $25.00 per week during the continuance of his permanent partial disability or until the sum of $17,280.00 be paid. The complaint also asks for such other and further relief as may be necessary.\\nOn the question of jurisdiction of the court to entertain a diversity suit where the amounts accrued at the time of bringing the suit, and at the time of trial, were less than the jurisdictional amount, but where the addition of the future weekly sums sought would exceed the $10,000.00 requirement, and on the question of the authority of the court to order the payment of future weekly amounts, Nelson and Smith have filed a memorandum, in which Victory concurs, supporting the jurisdiction of the court, and the authority of the court to order future payments.\\n\",\n",

      "                \"Mr. Justice Douglas\\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThis action for death benefits under the Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law of Tennessee (Tenn. Code Ann. 1934, \\u00a7 6851 et seq.) was commenced in 1945 by plaintiff-respondent in the Chancery Court of Hawkins County, Tennessee. The defendants-petitioners are the former employer of her deceased husband and the employer\\u2019s insurance carrier. Service was had on the insurance carrier in Hawkins County, and on the employer in Knox County. Respondent is a citizen of Tennessee, the employer is a North Carolina corporation, and the insurance carrier is a Connecticut corporation. The complaint alleged that respondent\\u2019s husband died as the result of an accident occurring in the course of his employment. Burial expenses plus benefits in the amount of $5,000, the maximum under the Tennessee statute, were sought on behalf of respondent and her two minor children, aged twelve and fifteen.\\nOn May 28, 1945, petitioners mailed a notice of intention to file a petition for removal to a federal District Court which was received by respondent\\u2019s attorney on the morning of May 29. The petition for removal was filed in the Chancery Court the same day, and on June 5 the removal order issued. In the federal court the petitioners moved for dismissal on the ground that venue was not properly laid in the Hawkins County Court, so that under Tennessee law that court had lacked jurisdiction. Respondent sought a remand of the case to the state court, contending that the requisites of diversity jurisdiction had not been met either as to jurisdictional amount or as to proper notice of filing of the removal petition, and that the suit was not removable because not one of a civil nature in law or equity. The District Court concluded that Hawkins County was not the proper venue. It thereupon dismissed the action without reaching the questions raised by respondent\\u2019s motion for a remand.\\nThe judgment was reversed on appeal. 154 F. 2d 881. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the jurisdictional minimum of $3,000 in controversy (Judicial Code \\u00a7 24, 28 U. S. C. \\u00a7 41 (1)) was not present, and therefore ordered the case remanded to the state court. In this disposition the Circuit Court of Appeals reached neither the state venue question raised by petitioners, nor respondent\\u2019s contention that the required notice of the filing of the removal petition was lacking. We granted certiorari because of an apparent conflict with Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, 293 U. S. 96, as to the jurisdictional minimum requirement.\\nFirst. It is suggested that a decision of a Circuit Court of Appeals ordering remand of a case to a state court is not reviewable. And it is also said that we lack power to review the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals, since the mandate of that court has issued and the District Court has remanded the cause to the state court.\\nAn order of a District Court remanding a cause to the state court from whence it came is not appealable, and hence may not be reviewed either in the Circuit Court of Appeals or here. Judicial Code \\u00a7 28, 28 U. S. C. \\u00a7 71; Kloeb v. Armour & Co., 311 U. S. 199; Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Stevens, 312 U. S. 563; United States v. Rice, 327 U. S. 742. But no such limitation affects our authority to review an action of the Circuit Court of Appeals, directing a remand to a state court. Gay v. Ruff, 292 U. S. 25. Nor does the fact that the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals has issued defeat this Court\\u2019s jurisdiction. Carr v. Zaja, 283 U. S. 52, and cases cited.\\nSecond. We think that the jurisdictional amount of $3,000 was involved in this suit. The contrary conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals was based on the nature of the award under the Tennessee statute. The award may be paid in installments at regular intervals by the employer or by a trustee with whom the amount of the award, reduced to present value, has been deposited. Tenn. Code \\u00a7 6893. Moreover, the death or remarriage of respondent, plus the death or attainment of the age of eighteen by the children, would terminate all payments. Tenn. Code \\u00a7 6883. Since an award to respondent would be payable in installments, and by operation of conditions subsequent the total payments might never reach $3,000, the Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the jurisdictional amount was lacking.\\nIf this case were one where judgment could be entered only for the installments due at the commencement of the suit (cf. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Viglas, 297 U. S. 672, 678), future installments could not be considered in determining whether the jurisdictional amount was involved, even though the judgment would be determinative of liability for future installments as they accrued. Wright v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 19 F. 2d 117, aff\\u2019d. 276 U. S. 602. Cf. Button v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 48 F. Supp. 168. But this is not that type of case. For the Tennessee statute which creates liability for the award contemplates a single action for the determination of claimant\\u2019s right to benefits and a single judgment for the award granted. See Tenn. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 6880, 6881, 6890, 6891, 6893; Shockley v. Morristown Produce & Ice Co., 171 Tenn. 591, 106 S.W. 2d 562.\\nNor does the fact that it cannot be known as a matter of absolute certainty that the amount which may ultimately be paid, if respondent prevails, will exceed $3,000, mean that the jurisdictional amount is lacking. This Court has rejected such a restrictive interpretation of the statute creating diversity jurisdiction. It has held that a possibility that payments will terminate before the total reaches the jurisdictional minimum is immaterial if the right to all the payments is in issue. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra; Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551. Future payments are not in any proper sense contingent, although they may be decreased or cut off altogether by the operation of conditions subsequent. Thompson v. Thompson, supra, p. 560. And there is no suggestion that by reason of life expectancy or law of averages the maximum amount recoverable can be expected to fall below the jurisdictional minimum. Cf. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra, p. 101. Moreover, the computation of the maximum amount recoverable is not complicated by the necessity of determining the life expectancy of respondent. Cf. Thompson v. Thompson, supra, p. 559; Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra, p. 100.\\nThird. Respondent, as is her right, United States v. Ballard, 322 U. S. 78, 88, and cases cited, seeks to support the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals on other grounds. But those questions were not passed upon by that court nor adequately presented here. So we deem it more appropriate to remand the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals so it may consider those questions. United States v. Ballard, supra.\\nReversed.\\nDeath benefits are provided in the amount of 60% of the average weekly wages of the employee (as computed in accordance with Tenn. Code \\u00a7 6852 (c)), but payments may not exceed $18 per week, nor continue for more than 400 weeks. \\u00a76880; \\u00a7 6883 (17). In addition there is a ceiling of $5,000 on total benefits exclusive of burial and certain other expenses. \\u00a7 6881. See Haynes v. Columbia Pictures Corp., 178 Tenn. 648, 162 S. W. 2d 383. The complaint alleged that 60% of the average weekly wages for the statutory period would exceed $5,000.\\nThe contention was that proper venue lay only in Roane County where, it was alleged, the accident occurred and the business of the employer is conducted. It was argued that service on the insurer in Hawkins County did not give the Hawkins County Court jurisdiction of the case.\\nSee note 1, supra.\"\n",

The employer was doing a construction job in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. The appellant was fireman of a boiler at the construction site. He rated his job as being heavy and strenuous. The appel-lee and cross-appellant, his employer, put the job on about the level of that of watchman. On September 9, 1952, while on the job, the appellant accidently sustained a fracture of the patella of his left knee. His leg was in a cast for nine weeks and one day. From the middle of June, 1953, to early April, 1954, the appellant worked at a couple of jobs, one of which he lost because his experience did not qualify him for it, and he was discharged from the second because he did not turn out enough work. From April 4, 1954, or thereabouts, he has been operating a business on his own account selling and repairing electrical equipment. He was paid workmen\\u2019s compensation benefits of $1,170.00 during his convalescence. Upon the termination of compensation payments the appellant sued the employer and its workmen's compensation insurer in the 25th Judicial District Court, St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, claiming that total and permanent disability entitled him to compensation for 400 weeks at the rate of $30.00 per week, subject to a credit of $1,170.00 already paid. Removal to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, based on diversity of citizenship, followed.\\nThe pertinent portions of the Louisiana Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Act are as-follows:\\n\\u201cCompensation shall be paid under this Chapter in accordance with the following schedule of payments:\\n\\u201c (1) For injdry producing temporary total disability to do work of any reasonable character, sixty-five per centum of wages during the period of disability, not beyond three hundred weeks.\\n\\u201c(2) For injury producing permanent total disability to do work of any reasonable character, sixty-five per centum of wages during the period of disability, not beyond four hundred weeks.\\n\\u201c(3) For injury producing partial disability to do work of any reasonable character, sixty-five per centum of the difference between wages at the time of injury and wages which the injured employee is able to earn thereafter during the period of disability, not beyond three hundred weeks.\\n\\u201c(4) In the following cases the compensation shall be as follows:\\n\\u2022Jv *\\n\\u201c(h) For the loss of a leg, sixty-five per centum of wages during one hundred seventy-five weeks. ******\\n\\u201c(n) A permanent total loss of the use of a member is equivalent to the amputation of the member.\\n\\u201c(o) In all cases involving a permanent partial loss of the use or function of the members mentioned hereinabove, compensation shall bear such proportion to the amounts named herein for the total loss of such members as the disability to such members bears to the total loss of the member, provided that in no case shall compensation for an injury to a member exceed the compensation payable for the loss of .such member.\\u201d\\nLouisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 23, \\u00a7 1221, LSA.\\n\\u201cWhere compensation has been paid under subdivisions (1), (2), or (3), of R.S. 23:1221, the amount of such payment shall be deducted from any compensation allowed under subdivision (4) thereof or under Sub-part C of this Part.\\u201d\\nLouisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 23, \\u00a7 1223, LSA.\\n\\u201cA judgment of compensation may be modified by subsequent agreement between the parties, with the approval of a judge of the court which rendered the same.\\n\\u201cAt any time six months after the rendition of a judgment of compensation, a judge of the trial court that rendered the judgment shall review the same upon the application of either party for a modification thereof, on the grounds that the incapacity of the employee has been subsequently diminished or increased, or that the judgment was obtained through error, fraud, or misrepresentation.\\u201d\\nLouisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 23, \\u00a7 1331, LSA.\\nThe case was tried to the court without a jury. Much testimony was taken and there were many conflicts as to disability vel non, the nature of the injuries sustained, their duration, the treatment required, and the extent to which it was followed. The court found that the appellant was not disabled within the meaning of the Act, and hence not entitled to recover under LSA-R.S. 23:-1221(1), (2), or (3). The court held, however, that appellant had a one-third partial loss of the use or function of his leg for which appellant was entitled to compensation under LSA-R.S. 23:1221 (4) (h) and (o). Judgment was entered for benefits of $30.00 per week for fifty-eight and one-third weeks, an aggregate of $1,750.00 upon which was to be credited the $1,170.00 previously paid. Thus the net award was $580.00.\\nFollowing the judgment for an amount which the appellant deemed inadequate, he moved to remand the case to the state court contending that the matter in controversy does not exceed $3,000.00. The motion was denied. The appellant brought this appeal asserting, in addition to the jurisdictional question, that he was entitled to compensation for either total permanent disability or total temporary disability. The employer and the insurer took a cross-appeal and urge that the loss of partial use by plaintiff of his leg was due to his failure to cooperate in the treatment prescribed, and also that in any event the loss of use was not over twenty, or, at the most, twenty-five per cent.\\nThe argument against Federal jurisdiction is based upon the language of the Louisiana Act upon which the appellant based his claim. The statute permits recovery \\u201cduring the * * * disability, not beyond four hundred weeks.\\u201d LSA-R.S. 23:1221(2). And it is provided that at any time after six months after the rendition of judgment it may be reviewed on application of either party on the grounds that the employee\\u2019s incapacity has been diminished or increased. So, it is said, the maximum amount involved is the accrual to the date of judgment and the amount of the award for six months thereafter. This is the rule adopted by the District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. The rule and the reason for it have been set forth in these words:\\n\\u201cOf course, if plaintiff should sustain his claim in full, and should remain permanently disabled, he would be entitled to receive a total of $5,408 over a period of 400 weeks or eight weeks less than four years. However, under the state statute (Sec. 20), the matter can be reopened at intervals of six months, and if the employee has fully recovered, payments can be stopped altogether. The parties may, also, with the approval of the court in which the action is brought, settle the entire liability in a lump sum, the amount of which might or might not be within the jurisdiction of this court. [Citing cases.] * * * Therefore, all that a judgment in a case of this kind can settle is that, at the time it is rendered, the plaintiff has suffered injuries through his employment, amounting to total disability, probably permanent, which entitle him to receive stated weekly wages for a period of six months or approximately 26 weeks. In this case at the rate claimed this would amount to about $350.\\u201d Godfrey v. Brown Paper Mill Co., Inc., D.C., 52 F.Supp. 926.\\nThe Godfrey decision was followed by the court rendering it in Guidry v. J. Ray McDermott Co., Inc., D.C., 89 F.Supp. 60. The contrary rule has prevailed in the Eastern District of Louisiana where jurisdiction has been taken and retained in workmen\\u2019s compensation cases under the Louisiana Act. Butler v. Employers Mut. of Wausau, Wis., D. C., 105 F.Supp. 105; Boyd v. R. P. Farnsworth & Co., D.C., 105 F.Supp. 113. The District Court for the District of New Jersey had before it a question involving the Louisiana Act. There a plaintiff asserted that she, as widow and sole dependent of an employee who was fatally injured while employed, was entitled to weekly payments of $14.30 for 300 weeks. The statute provided that \\u201c \\u2018The marriage or death of any dependent shall terminate payments to such dependent, * * *.\\u2019 \\u201d The court sustained jurisdiction, saying:\\n\\u201cIn the State of Louisiana a judgment for weekly payments under the Liability Act until death or remarriage of the plaintiff is erroneous. Laurent v. Dendinger, 13 La.App. 234, 126 So. 600, 127 So. 755. A proper judgment is for the payment of these benefits for the full period of 300 weeks. Smith v. Samuel T. Gately Marble & Granite Works, La. App., 157 So. 802. And the fact that a condition subsequent \\u2014 marriage or death \\u2014 will operate as a forfeiture of future benefits, and, hence, lessen the amount ultimately to be paid, is immaterial. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, 293 U.S. 96, 55 S.Ct. 1, 79 L.Ed. 219.\\u201d Franzen v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., D.C., 36 F.Supp. 375, 377.\\nThe Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit approved the opinion of the District Court from which we have quoted. Franzen v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 146 F.2d 837.\\nA like case \\u00e1rese under similar provisions of the Tennessee Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review a direction to remand for want of jurisdictional amount. It had been held by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 6 Cir., 154 F.2d 881 that since the award payable in installments subject to conditions subsequent the total payments might never reach $3,000, the jurisdictional amount was lacking. In reaching a contrary conclusion the Supreme Court said:\\n\\u201cIf this case were one where judgment could be entered only for the installments due at the commencement of the suit (cf. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Viglas, 297 U. S. 672, 678, 56 S.Ct. 615, 617, 80 L. Ed. 971), future installments could not be considered in determining whether the jurisdictional amount was involved, even though the judgment would be determinative of liability for future installments as they accrued. Wright v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 19 F.2d 117, affirmed 276 U.S. 602, 48 S.Ct. 323, 72 L.Ed. 726. Cf. Button v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., D.C., 48 F.Supp. 168. But this is not that type of case. For the Tennessee statute which creates liability for the award contemplates a single action for the determination of claimant\\u2019s right to benefits and a single judgment for the award granted. See Tenn. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 6880, 6881, 6890, 6891, 6893; Shockley v. Morristown Produce & Ice Co., 171 Tenn. 591, 106 S.W.2d 562.\\n\\u201cNor does the fact that it cannot be known as a matter of absolute certainty that the amount which may ultimately be paid, if respondent prevails, will exceed $3,000, mean that the jurisdictional amount is lacking. This Court has rejected such a restrictive interpretation of the statute creating diversity jurisdiction. It has held that a possibility that payments will terminate before the total reaches the jurisdictional minimum is immaterial if the right to all the payments is in issue. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra [293 U.S. 96, 55 S.Ct. 1, 79 L.Ed. 219] ; Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551, 33 S.Ct. 129, 57 L.Ed. 347. Future payments are not in any proper sense contingent, although they may be decreased or cut off altogether by the operation of conditions subsequent. Thompson v. Thompson, supra, 226 U.S. at page 560, 33 S.Ct. 130. And there is no suggestion that by reason of life expectancy or law of averages the maximum amount recoverable can be expected to fall below the jurisdictional minimum. Cf. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra, 293 U.S. at page 101, 55 S.Ct. 2. Moreover, the computation of the maximum amount recoverable is not complicated by the necessity of determining the life expectancy of respondent. Cf. Thompson v. Thompson, supra, 226 U.S. at page 559, 33 S.Ct. 130; Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra, 293 U.S. at page 100, 55 S.Ct. 2.\\u201d Aetna Casualty Co. v. Flowers, 330 U.S. 464, 67 S.Ct. 798, 800, 91 L. Ed. 1024, reversing 6 Cir., 154 F.2d 881.\\nThe appellant would distinguish the Franzen v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., supra, and Aetna Casualty Co. v. Flowers, supra, cases on the ground that they are for death benefits payable to a dependent upon whose death payments would cease, rather than, as here, for disability benefits which would decrease or terminate if the employee\\u2019s disability diminished or vanished. We cannot make such distinction. We think Aetna Casualty Co. v. Flowers, supra, is controlling. The reasoning of the Supreme Court is no less applicable to the case before us than to the case reviewed and decided by it. If the condition subsequent of death, which is certain, does not restrict jurisdiction, the uncertain condition of a diminishing of incapacity will not do so. We conclude that the requirement of the federal jurisdictional amount was met.\\nThe parties are in agreement that the test of \\u201cdisability\\u201d is whether the employee can do the same type of work he was doing at the time of his accident in the customary way without any unusual difficulty or pain. Knispel v. Gulf States Utilities Co., Inc., 174 La. 401, 141 So. 9; Fisher v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., La.App., 28 So.2d 59. Ample proof supported the finding of disability.\\nThere is no question but that an injured employee is not entitled to compensation during a period while his recovery is prevented or delayed by his own act or conduct. Brown v. Union Oil Mill, Inc., La.App., 59 So.2d 144, and cases there cited. Evidence adduced by the appellees indicated that the appellant had failed to follow prescribed treatments which, appellees urge, would have hastened his recovery and assured his ultimate full recovery. The appellant has raised doubts as to the necessity or wisdom of the suggested treatment. This was for the trial court\\u2019s determination and has been determined, inferentially, by it. The appellees, in their cross-appeal, specify as error the failure of the trial court to make a specific finding of fact on the cooperation issue. As to the necessity for such a finding we find it stated that:\\n\\u201cThe federal rule relating to findings of a trial court does not require the court to make findings on all facts presented or to make detailed evidentiary findings; if the findings are sufficient to support the ultimate conclusion of the court they are sufficient. * * * Nor is it necessary that the trial court make findings asserting the negative of each issue of fact raised. * * * The ultimate test as to the adequacy of findings will always be whether they are sufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues to provide a basis for decision and whether they are supported by the evidence.\\u201d Carr v. Yokohama Specie Bank, Limited, 9 Cir., 200 F.2d 251, 255.\\nThe language above, was quoted with approval by this court in Weber v. McKee, 215 F.2d 447. The failure to include a finding of whether the appellant interfered with his own progress to recovery is not error.\\nWe need not enter upon any discussion of the evidentiary facts or consider the conflicts of the evidence. It is enough to say that the findings of the trial court are supported by adequate proof. It was found that there was a 25% to 33%% impairment of the use of appellant\\u2019s leg. The trial court was under a duty to construe the statute and the testimony liberally in favor of the appellant and give him the benefit of any doubt. Jones v. Hunsicker, 188 La. 468, 177 So. 576.

C. \\u00a7 1332, as amended in 1958, which grants jurisdiction to United States District Courts of all civil actions between citizens of different States \\u201cwhere the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs . . . .\\u201d\\nPetitioner, Horton, was injured while working for an employer in Texas insured by the respondent, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. Pursuant to the Texas Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law, petitioner filed a claim with the Texas Industrial Accident Board against his employer and the respondent insurance company alleging that he had been totally and permanently incapacitated and claiming the maximum recovery under the law of $35 per week for 401 weeks, or a total of $14,035. After administrative hearings the Board decided that petitioner would be disabled for only 30 weeks and accordingly made an award of only $1,050. Section 5 of Art. 8307 of the Texas Workmen\\u2019s Compensation Law permits either the employee or the insurance company, if dissatisfied with an award, to \\u201cbring suit in the county where the injury occurred to set aside said final ruling,\\u201d in which event the issues shall be determined \\u201cupon trial de novo, and the burden or [sic] proof shall be upon the party claiming compensation,\\u201d but in no event shall the court allow recovery in excess of the statutory maximum of $14,035. Acting under this provision of state law, the respondent, on April 30, 1959, the very day of the award, filed this diversity case in the United States District Court to set aside the award, alleging that petitioner had claimed, was claiming and would claim $14,035, but denying that petitioner was entitled to recover anything at all under Texas law. One week later the petitioner, who also was dissatisfied with the award, filed an action in the state court to set aside the Board\\u2019s award and to recover in that court the full $14,035. After that, petitioner moved to dismiss the respondent\\u2019s federal court suit on the ground that the value of the \\u201cmatter in controversy\\u201d was only the amount of the award, $1,050, and not the amount of his claim of $14,035, although he also contemporaneously filed, subject to his motion to dismiss, what he designated as a compulsory counterclaim for the full amount he had claimed before the Texas Board and in his Texas State Court suit. The District Court held that the \\u201cmatter in controversy\\u201d in the federal action was only the amount of the $1,050 award that the respondent company had asked the court to set aside. In so holding the District Court relied on National Surety Cory. v. Chamberlain, in which another District Court in Texas had reached the same conclusion as to jurisdiction largely on the basis of what it deemed to have been the purpose of Congress in enacting the 1958 amendment to 28 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1332, which amendment rather severely cut down the jurisdiction of Federal District Courts, particularly in state workmen\\u2019s compensation cases. The Court of Appeals reversed, and we granted certiorari to decide the'important jurisdictional questions raised under the 1958 amendment.\\nFor reasons to be stated, we hold that the District Court has jurisdiction of the controversy.\\nFirst. It is true, as the Chamberlain opinion pointed out, that the purpose and effect of the 1958 amendment were to reduce congestion in the Federal District Courts partially caused by the large number of civil cases that were being brought under the long-standing $3,000 jurisdictional rule. This effort to reduce District Court congestion followed years of study by the United States Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, as well as by the Congress. To accomplish this purpose the 1958 amendment took several different but related steps. It raised the requisite jurisdictional amount from $3,000 to $10,000 in diversity and federal question cases; it provided that a corporation is to be deemed a citizen not only of the State by which it was incorporated but also of the State where it has its principal place of business; and, most importantly here, it also for the first time forbade the removal of state workmen\\u2019s compensation cases from state courts to United States District Courts. By granting district judges a discretionary power to impose costs on a federal court plaintiff if he should \\u201crecover less than the sum or value of $10,000,\\u201d the amendment further manifested a congressional purpose to discourage the trying of suits involving less than $10,000 in federal courts. In discussing the question of state workmen\\u2019s compensation cases, the Senate Report on the amendment evidenced a concern not only about the problem of congestion in the federal courts, but also about trial burdens that claimants might suffer by having to go to trial in federal rather than state courts due to the fact that the state courts are likely to be closer to an injured worker\\u2019s home and may also provide him with special procedural advantages in workmen\\u2019s compensation cases.\\nThe foregoing are some of the appealing considerations that led the District Court to conclude that it would frustrate the congressional purpose to permit insurers to file workmen\\u2019s compensation suits in federal courts when Congress had deliberately provided that such suits could not be removed to federal courts if filed by claimants in state courts. But after the most deliberate study of the whole problem by lawyers and judges and after its consideration by lawyers on the Senate Judiciary Committee in the light of statistics on both removals and original filings, Congress used language specifically barring removal of such cases from state to federal courts and at the same time left unchanged the old language which just as specifically permits civil suits to be filed in federal courts in cases where there are both diversity of citizenship and the prescribed jurisdictional amount. In this situation we must take the intent of Congress with regard to the filing of diversity cases in Federal District Courts to be that which its language clearly sets forth. Congress could very easily have used language to bar filing of workmen\\u2019s compensation suits by the insurer as well as removal of such suits, and it could easily do so still. We therefore hold that under the present law the District Court has jurisdiction to try this civil case between citizens of different States if the matter in controversy is in excess of $10,000.\\nSecond. We agree with petitioner that determination of the value of the matter in controversy for purposes of federal jurisdiction is a federal question to be decided under federal standards, although the federal courts must, of course, look to state law to determine the nature and extent of the right to be enforced in a diversity case. It therefore is not controlling here that Texas has held that the crucial factor for allocating its cases among different state courts on an amount-in-controversy basis is the amount originally claimed before its State Compensation Board.\\nThe general federal rule has long been to decide what the amount in controversy is from the complaint itself, unless it appears or is in some way shown that the amount stated in the complaint is not claimed \\u201cin good faith.\\u201d In deciding this question of good faith we have said that it \\u201cmust appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal.\\u201d The complaint of the respondent company filed in the District Court, while denying any liability at all and asking that the award of $1,050 against it be set aside, also alleges that petitioner Horton has claimed, now claims and will claim that he has suffered total and permanent disability and is entitled to a maximum recovery of $14,035, which, of course, is in excess of the $10,000 requisite to give a federal court jurisdiction of this controversy. No denial of these allegations in the complaint has been made, no attempted disclaimer or surrender of any part of the original claim has been made by petitioner, and there has been no other showing, let alone a showing \\u201cto a legal certainty,\\u201d of any lack of good faith on the part of the respondent in alleging that a $14,035 claim is in controversy. It would contradict the whole record as well as the allegations of the complaint to say that this dispute involves only $1,050. The claim before the Board was $14,035; the state court suit of petitioner asked that much; the conditional counterclaim in the federal court claims the same amount. Texas law under which this claim was created and has its being leaves the entire $14,035 claim open for adjudication in a de novo court trial, regardless of the award. Thus the record before us shows beyond a doubt that the award is challenged by both parties and is binding on neither; that petitioner claims more than $10,000 from the respondent and the respondent denies it should have to pay petitioner anything at all. No matter which party brings it into court, the controversy remains the same; it involves the same amount of money and is to be adjudicated and determined under the same rules. Unquestionably, therefore, the amount in controversy is in excess of $10,000.\\nThird. Petitioner contends, however, that even though the amount in controversy is more than $10,000, the suit filed by the company is nothing more than an appeal from a state administrative order, that a Federal District Court has no appellate jurisdiction and that the dismissal of the case by the District Court therefore is supportable on that ground. This contention rests almost entirely on Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Stude, 346 U. S. 574, 581, which held that a United States District Court was without jurisdiction to consider an appeal \\u201ctaken administratively or judicially in a state proceeding.\\u201d Aside from many other relevant distinctions which need not be pointed out, the Stude case is without weight here because, as shown by the Texas Supreme Court\\u2019s interpretation of its compensation act:\\n\\u201cThe suit to set aside an award of the board is in fact a suit, not an appeal. It is filed as any other suit is filed and when filed the subject matter is withdrawn from the board.\\u201d\\nIt is true that as conditions precedent to filing a suit a claim must have been filed with the Board and the Board must have made a final ruling and decision. But the trial in court is not an appellate proceeding. It is a trial de novo wholly without reference to what may have been decided by the Board.\\nThe Court of Appeals was right in holding that the District Court had jurisdiction of this case and its judgment is\\nAffirmed.\\nAct of July 25, 1958, 72 Stat. 415.\\nVernon\\u2019s Tex Ann.

Flowers, supra, cases on the ground that they are for death benefits payable to a dependent upon whose death payments would cease, rather than, as here, for disability benefits which would decrease or terminate if the employee\\u2019s disability diminished or vanished. We cannot make such distinction. We think Aetna Casualty Co. v. Flowers, supra, is controlling. The reasoning of the Supreme Court is no less applicable to the case before us than to the case reviewed and decided by it. If the condition subsequent of death, which is certain, does not restrict jurisdiction, the uncertain condition of a diminishing of incapacity will not do so. We conclude that the requirement of the federal jurisdictional amount was met. The parties are in agreement that the test of \\u201cdisability\\u201d is whether the employee can do the same type of work he was doing at the time of his accident in the customary way without any unusual difficulty or pain. Knispel v. Gulf States Utilities Co., Inc., 174 La. 401, 141 So. 9; Fisher v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., La.App., 28 So.2d 59. Ample proof supported the finding of disability.\",\n",

Ed. 971), future installments could not be considered in determining whether the jurisdictional amount was involved, even though the judgment would be determinative of liability for future installments as they accrued. Wright v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 19 F.2d 117, affirmed 276 U.S. 602, 48 S.Ct. 323, 72 L.Ed. 726. Cf. Button v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., D.C., 48 F.Supp. 168. But this is not that type of case. For the Tennessee statute which creates liability for the award contemplates a single action for the determination of claimant\\u2019s right to benefits and a single judgment for the award granted. See Tenn. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 6880, 6881, 6890, 6891, 6893; Shockley v. Morristown Produce & Ice Co., 171 Tenn. 591, 106 S.W.2d 562. \\u201cNor does the fact that it cannot be known as a matter of absolute certainty that the amount which may ultimately be paid, if respondent prevails, will exceed $3,000, mean that the jurisdictional amount is lacking. This Court has rejected such a restrictive interpretation of the statute creating diversity jurisdiction. It has held that a possibility that payments will terminate before the total reaches the jurisdictional minimum is immaterial if the right to all the payments is in issue. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra [293 U.S. 96, 55 S.Ct. 1, 79 L.Ed. 219] ; Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551, 33 S.Ct. 129, 57 L.Ed. 347. Future payments are not in any proper sense contingent, although they may be decreased or cut off altogether by the operation of conditions subsequent. Thompson v.

In contrast, management was “vague on the specifics of not being able to meet the necessities of the supervisors and the production needs of the newspaper.” Id. The arbitrator made no further findings, but instead found that the Union’s grievance was justified. He then crafted his own solution, whereby the four new supervisors and the Union employees were thrown into a “seniority pool” for vacation selection purposes. He also provided for a grievance procedure through the Union for employees that believed they were adversely affected by the new procedure. The Beacon Journal refused to comply with the arbitration award and instead instituted this lawsuit under section 801 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185.

The arbitrator granted the grievance, allowing all plaintiffs, who, but for being laid off, would have been able to continue employment and thereby qualify for vacation benefits.

The district court granted the Union\\u2019s motion for summary judgment and upheld the arbitrator\\u2019s award. The Company appealed.\n",
