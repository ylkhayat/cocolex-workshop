    "128: Moreover, the Prison Service Order must be taken to be addressed to prisoners as well as to prison authorities. It does not, however, include the qualifying explanations, deriving from the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in Bieber and relied on by the Government in their pleadings before this Court, as to the effect of the Human Rights Act and of Article 3 of the Convention on the exercise of the Secretary of State’s power to release under section 30 of the 1997 Act. In particular, the Order does not reflect the possibility – made available by the Human Rights Act – for even whole life prisoners to seek release on legitimate penological grounds some time into the service of their sentence. To that extent, on the basis of the Government’s own submissions as to the state of the applicable domestic law, the Prison Service Order is liable to give to whole life prisoners – those directly affected by it – only a partial picture of the exceptional conditions capable of leading to the exercise of the Secretary of State’s power under section 30.\n",

    "83: Turning to the Government’s comments concerning the lack of guidance from the Chamber as to what, if any, restrictions on the right of convicted prisoners to vote would be compatible with the Convention, the Court notes that its function is in principle to rule on the compatibility with the Convention of the existing measures. It is primarily for the State concerned to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its obligation under Article 46 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 202, ECHR 2004-II, and Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 210, ECHR 2005-IV). In cases where a systemic violation has been found the Court has, with a view to assisting the respondent State in fulfilling its obligations under Article 46, indicated the type of measure that might be taken to put an end to the situation found to exist (see, for example, Broniowski v.  [GC], no. 31443/96, §§ 193-94, ECHR 2004-V). In other exceptional cases, the nature of the violation found may be such as to leave no real choice as to the measures required to remedy it and the Court may decide to indicate only one such measure (see Assanidze, cited above, § 202).\n",

It referred to Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, General Comment No. 20 of the UN Human Rights Committee, the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, the European Code of Police Ethics (cited above) and the European Prison Rules (to which the Court and the CPT referred in their work), as well as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s Guidebook on Democratic Policing. It derived the following principles from those texts: everyone had the right not to be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment specified that these terms should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses; non-violent means should be attempted first; force should be used only when strictly necessary, and solely for lawful law-enforcement purposes; in their relations with persons in detention, law-enforcement officials should not use force, except when strictly necessary for the maintenance of security and order within the institution, or when personal safety was threatened; no exceptions or excuses should be allowed for unlawful use of force; the use of force was always to be proportionate to lawful objectives; restraint should be exercised in the use of force; damage and injury should be minimised; a range of means for differentiated use of force should be made available; all law-enforcement officials should be trained in the use of the various means for differentiated use of force; and all officers should be trained in the use of non-violent means.\n",

The Supreme Court has made clear in the Steelworkers’ Trilogy and its progeny that courts must accord an arbitrator’s decision substantial deference because it is the arbitrator’s construction of the agreement, not the court’s construction, to which the parties have agreed. See United Paperworkers Int’l Union v. Misco, 484 U.S. 29, 37-8, 108 S.Ct. 364, 371, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987) (“Because the parties have contracted to have disputes settled by an arbitrator chosen by them rather than by a judge, it is the arbitrator’s view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract that they have agreed to accept.”). Hence, our review is extremely limited. We review the arbitrator’s decision only to determine whether the arbitrator was “arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority.” Id. at 38, 108 S.Ct. at 371. If the arbitrator’s award “draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement,” and is not merely the arbitrator’s “own brand of industrial justice,” the award is legitimate.

Courts will not weigh the merits of the claim or determine whether the claim is supported by language in the written instrument; otherwise, the policy of settling labor disputes through arbitration would be undermined.

In contrast, management was “vague on the specifics of not being able to meet the necessities of the supervisors and the production needs of the newspaper.” Id. The arbitrator made no further findings, but instead found that the Union’s grievance was justified. He then crafted his own solution, whereby the four new supervisors and the Union employees were thrown into a “seniority pool” for vacation selection purposes. He also provided for a grievance procedure through the Union for employees that believed they were adversely affected by the new procedure.

The Supreme Court has made clear in the Steelworkers’ Trilogy and its progeny that courts must accord an arbitrator’s decision substantial deference because it is the arbitrator’s construction of the agreement, not the court’s construction, to which the parties have agreed. See United Paperworkers Int’l Union v. Misco, 484 U.S. 29, 37-8, 108 S.Ct. 364, 371, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987) (“Because the parties have contracted to have disputes settled by an arbitrator chosen by them rather than by a judge, it is the arbitrator’s view\n",
    "\n",
    "# 114 F.3d 596\n",
    "# of the facts and of the meaning of the contract that they have agreed to accept.”). Hence, our review is extremely limited. We review the arbitrator’s decision only to determine whether the arbitrator was “arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority.” Id. at 38, 108 S.Ct. at 371. If the arbitrator’s award “draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement,” and is not merely the arbitrator’s “own brand of industrial justice,” the award is legitimate. United Steelworkers of Am. v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Co., 363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960). Courts will not weigh the merits of the claim or determine whether the claim is supported by language in the written instrument; otherwise, the policy of settling labor disputes through arbitration would be undermined. Misco, 484 U.S. at 36, 108 S.Ct. at 369-70; see also United Steelworkers of Am. v. American Mfg. Co., 363 U.S. 564, 568, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 1346, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960) (“[C]ourts, therefore, have no business weighing the merits of the grievance, considering whether there is equity in a particular claim, or determining whether there is particular language in the written instrument which will support the claim.”). Despite the great amount of deference accorded an arbitrator’s decision, our review is not toothless when an arbitrator’s award disregards the collective bargaining agreement and its terms. See Lattimer-Stevens Co. v. United Steelworkers, 913 F.2d 1166, 1171-72 (6th Cir.1990) (Boggs, J., dissenting) (delineating eases setting aside arbitrator’s decision). Even though arbitrators are not flawless, courts must refrain from reversing an arbitrator simply because the court disagrees with the result or believes the arbitrator made a serious legal or factual error. Misco, 484 U.S. at 38, 108 S.Ct. at 371 (“that a court is convinced [the\n",

    "# Alken-Ziegler, Incorporated, (Company) appeals from the district court’s grant of summary judgment affirming an arbitration award in favor of the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, and Local Union 985 (Union). For the following reasons, we find that, even in light of our deferential review, the arbitrator disregarded the provisions of the labor contract. Therefore, we reverse the district court’s decision and vacate the arbitration award.\n",

    "# The Company and the Union were parties to a labor contract effective December 15, 1999. In March, 2001, the Company notified the Union that it would be closing its Novi plant and that it would be necessary to terminate all of the employees at the facility. As a result of the plant closing on October 17, 2001, all but one employee was terminated during the calendar year, 2001. The Company refused to pay vacationpay benefits to employees who did not work for the Company on January 1, 2002. The Union filed a grievance.\n",
    "# Article 16 (61) of the labor agreement sets forth the eligibility requirement for payment of vacation benefits:\n",
    "# (a) Employees shall be eligible for vacations, time off and vacation pay as set forth below.\n",
    "# (b) For purposes of eligibility, the vacation year will be considered the calendar year period from January 1st to December 31.\n",
    "# (c) An employee covered by the agreement who is actually working on January 1st of any year and who has at least six (6) months seniority and has' worked at least eight hundred (800) hours from and after January 1st of the previous year shall be paid the equivalent of two-and-one half (2-1/2) days vacation pay.\n",
    "# ijs ifc tjc %\n",
    "# (f) Employees with twelve (12) months or more of seniority who have worked more than eight hundred (800) hours, but less than sixteen hundred (1600) hours, during the vacation year, shall receive a pro-rated vacation pay on the basis of the ratio of their actual hours to sixteen hundred (1600) hours, but not to exceed the full vacation pay to which they were entitled by reason of their seniority and hours worked as set forth above.\n",
    "# (g) Vacation pay will be computed on a straight time forty (40) hour basis including applicable shift premium. The employee’s hour basis including applicable shift premium. The employee’s hourly rate in effect when vacation is taken will be used to compute vacation pay. If an employee is laid off after six (6) months service, their vacation pay will be pro-rated same as above.\n",
    "# Pursuant to Article 5 of the labor contract, the parties arbitrated the grievance. At the arbitration the Union asserted that because it was not the employees’ fault that they were unable to work the full year, the employees were entitled to their vacation pay. The arbitrator granted the grievance, allowing all plaintiffs, who, but for being laid off, would have been able to continue employment and thereby qualify for vacation benefits. The arbitrator reasoned that “[i]t would be unreasonable to cause such forfeitures particularly where an employee has no control over the situation.”\n",
    "# The Company filed a complaint in the district court asserting that the arbitrator’s award contradicted the clear, mandatory commands of the labor contract, which required that an employee be “actually working” for the Company as of January 1, 2002, to receive vacation pay. The district court granted the Union’s motion for summary judgment and upheld the arbitrator’s award. The Company appealed.\n",
