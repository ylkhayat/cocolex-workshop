       "   '2.Guidance',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.1. Under Section 15A of FSMR, the Regulator has jurisdiction for the regulation of AML/TFS in the ADGM. The AML Rulebook sets out the requirements imposed by the Regulator. The U.A.E. criminal law applies in the ADGM and, therefore, Persons in the ADGM must be aware of their obligations in respect of the criminal law as well as these Rules. Relevant U.A.E. criminal laws include Federal AML Legislation and Federal Law No. (31) of 2021 (the Penal Code of the United Arab Emirates (“U.A.E.”)). The Rules in the AML Rulebook should not be relied upon to interpret or determine the application of the criminal laws of the U.A.E.',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.2. Federal AML Legislation applies in the ADGM.  It is amended as required and new legislation is also published. Persons in the ADGM must ensure they have a current understanding of their obligations under Federal AML Legislation.  The definition of Federal AML Legislation is broad.  It includes all federal legislation as may be in force relating to money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing, the financing of unlawful organisations and sanctions compliance including Targeted Financial Sanctions.  Particular pieces of legislation to be aware of include:\\n(a)\\tFederal Law No. (7) of 2014 regarding Combatting Terrorism Offences;\\n(b)\\tFederal Decree Law No. (20) of 2018 on Anti-Money Laundering, Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations;\\n(c)\\tCabinet Decision No. (10) of 2019 concerning the Implementing Regulation of Decree Law No. (20) of 2018;\\n(d)\\tCabinet Decision No. (74) of 2020 concerning the Terrorism Lists Regulation and Implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions on the Suppression and Combatting of Terrorism, Terrorist Financing, Countering the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and its Financing and Relevant Resolutions.',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.3. The AML Rulebook has been designed to provide a primary reference point for Relevant Persons that are supervised by the Regulator for AML/TFS compliance in accordance with the scope of application outlined in Rule \\u200e1.2.1. Accordingly it applies to all Relevant Persons, but to different degrees as provided in Rule \\u200e1.2.1(2). The AML Rulebook takes into consideration the fact that Relevant Persons have differing money laundering risk profiles. A Relevant Person should familiarise itself with the AML Rulebook and assess the extent to which the Chapters and sections apply to it. Relevant Persons should also ensure they are aware of, and take into account, all notices issued by the Regulator as well as relevant guidance and guidelines issued by governmental authorities in the U.A.E.',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.4. The AML Rulebook is not intended to be read in isolation from other U.A.E. relevant legislation or developments in international policy and best practice. To the extent applicable, Relevant Persons need to be aware of, and take into account, how these may impact the Relevant Person\\'s day-to-day operations. This is particularly relevant when considering the Local Terrorist List and the United Nations Security Council (\"UNSC\") Resolutions which apply in the ADGM, and Sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions which may apply to a Relevant Person depending on the Relevant Person\\'s jurisdiction of origin, its business and/or customer base.',\n",
       "   \"2.Guidance.5. Chapter \\u200e1 specifies who is ultimately responsible for a Relevant Person's compliance with the AML Rulebook. The Regulator expects the Governing Body and Senior Management of a Relevant Person to establish a robust and effective AML/TFS compliance culture for the business.\",\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.6. Chapter \\u200e2 provides an overview of the AML Rulebook and Chapter \\u200e3 sets out the key definitions in the AML Rulebook.',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.7. Chapter \\u200e4 outlines the general compliance requirements including Group policies, notifications, record-keeping requirements and the annual AML Return.',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.8. Chapter \\u200e5 explains the meaning of the risk-based approach (\"RBA\"), which should be applied when complying with the AML Rulebook. The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person\\'s business, in Chapter \\u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \\u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \\u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \\u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \\u200e8. This overlap may occur at the initial stages of onboarding of customers but may also occur when undertaking ongoing CDD.',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.9. Chapter \\u200e9 sets out where a Relevant Person may rely on a third party to undertake all or some of its CDD obligations. Reliance on third-party CDD reduces the need to duplicate CDD already performed for a customer. Alternatively, a Relevant Person may outsource some or all of its CDD obligations to a service provider.',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.10. Chapter \\u200e10 sets out certain obligations in relation to correspondent banking, wire transfers and other matters which are limited to Authorised Persons, other than a Credit Rating Agency, and Recognised Bodies and, in particular, to banks.',\n",
       "   \"2.Guidance.11.

       "   '2.Guidance.12. Chapter \\u200e12 sets out the obligation for a Relevant Person to appoint an MLRO and the responsibilities of such a Person.',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.13. Chapter \\u200e13 sets out the requirements for AML/TFS training and awareness. A Relevant Person should adopt the RBA when complying with Chapter \\u200e13, so as to make its training and awareness proportionate to the money laundering risks of the business and the role of the relevant Employee(s).',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.14. Chapter \\u200e14 contains the obligations applying to all Relevant Persons concerning Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports, which are required to be made under Federal AML Legislation.',\n",

       "   '2.Guidance.17. The U.A.E. criminal law. Under Article 3 of Federal Decree By Law No. 20 of 2018, a Relevant Person may be criminally liable for the offence of money laundering if such an activity is intentionally committed in its name or for its account. Relevant Persons are also reminded that:\\n(a)\\tthe failure to report suspicions of money laundering;\\n(b)\\t\"tipping off\"; and\\n(c)\\tassisting in the commission of money laundering,\\nmay each constitute a criminal offence that is punishable under the laws of the U.A.E.',\n",
       "   '2.Guidance.18. The U.A.E. criminal law. Under Article 27 of Federal Decree Law No. (20) of 2018 on Anti-Money Laundering, Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations, Relevant Persons and their Directors and Employees are protected from criminal, civil or administrative penalty or sanction when providing any information, including confidential information, as part of a good faith report made pursuant to Federal AML Legislation to relevant regulatory bodies.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The Regulator has had regard to the FATF Recommendations in making these Rules and has determined to closely align these Rules with the FATF Recommendations, where that is deemed to be necessary and appropriate. A Relevant Person may wish to refer to the FATF Recommendations and Interpretive Notes to assist it in complying with these Rules. However, in the event that a FATF Recommendation or Interpretive Note conflicts with a Rule in the AML Rulebook, the relevant Rule takes precedence.',\n",

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has published a set of guidelines for banks (Sound Management of Risks related to Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, January 2014) which are intended to supplement FATF Recommendations. Banks operating in the ADGM should read the Basel Committee guidelines in conjunction with FATF Recommendations and in complying with these Rules.',\n",

The Wolfsberg Group is an association of thirteen global banks that has published guidance aimed at assisting financial institutions in managing money laundering risks (Wolfsberg Statement Guidance on a Risk Based Approach for Managing Money Laundering Risks, March 2006) and in preventing terrorist financing (Wolfsberg Statement on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, January 2002). Banks operating in the ADGM should be familiar with relevant Wolfsberg Group published guidance in conjunction with the FATF Recommendations and in complying with these Rules.',\n",

       "   '2.Guidance.27. Sanctions. UNSC Sanctions and Sanctions issued or administered by the U.A.E., including Targeted Financial Sanctions, apply in the ADGM.

       "   '2.Guidance.28. Sanctions. The FATF has issued guidance on Targeted Financial Sanctions.

In particular, Sanctions administered by the European Union, the U.K. (“HM Treasury”) and the U.S. (Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)) may need to be carefully considered.

       "  '2. OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE OF THE AML RULEBOOK\\n2.Guidance\\n2.Guidance.1. Under Section 15A of FSMR, the Regulator has jurisdiction for the regulation of AML/TFS in the ADGM. The AML Rulebook sets out the requirements imposed by the Regulator. The U.A.E. criminal law applies in the ADGM and, therefore, Persons in the ADGM must be aware of their obligations in respect of the criminal law as well as these Rules. Relevant U.A.E. criminal laws include Federal AML Legislation and Federal Law No. (31) of 2021 (the Penal Code of the United Arab Emirates (“U.A.E.”)). The Rules in the AML Rulebook should not be relied upon to interpret or determine the application of the criminal laws of the U.A.E.\\n2.Guidance.2. Federal AML Legislation applies in the ADGM.  It is amended as required and new legislation is also published. Persons in the ADGM must ensure they have a current understanding of their obligations under Federal AML Legislation.  The definition of Federal AML Legislation is broad.  It includes all federal legislation as may be in force relating to money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing, the financing of unlawful organisations and sanctions compliance including Targeted Financial Sanctions.  Particular pieces of legislation to be aware of include:\\n(a)\\tFederal Law No. (7) of 2014 regarding Combatting Terrorism Offences;\\n(b)\\tFederal Decree Law No. (20) of 2018 on Anti-Money Laundering, Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations;\\n(c)\\tCabinet Decision No. (10) of 2019 concerning the Implementing Regulation of Decree Law No. (20) of 2018;\\n(d)\\tCabinet Decision No. (74) of 2020 concerning the Terrorism Lists Regulation and Implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions on the Suppression and Combatting of Terrorism, Terrorist Financing, Countering the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and its Financing and Relevant Resolutions.\\n2.Guidance.3. The AML Rulebook has been designed to provide a primary reference point for Relevant Persons that are supervised by the Regulator for AML/TFS compliance in accordance with the scope of application outlined in Rule \\u200e1.2.1. Accordingly it applies to all Relevant Persons, but to different degrees as provided in Rule \\u200e1.2.1(2). The AML Rulebook takes into consideration the fact that Relevant Persons have differing money laundering risk profiles. A Relevant Person should familiarise itself with the AML Rulebook and assess the extent to which the Chapters and sections apply to it. Relevant Persons should also ensure they are aware of, and take into account, all notices issued by the Regulator as well as relevant guidance and guidelines issued by governmental authorities in the U.A.E.\\n2.Guidance.4. The AML Rulebook is not intended to be read in isolation from other U.A.E. relevant legislation or developments in international policy and best practice. To the extent applicable, Relevant Persons need to be aware of, and take into account, how these may impact the Relevant Person\\'s day-to-day operations. This is particularly relevant when considering the Local Terrorist List and the United Nations Security Council (\"UNSC\") Resolutions which apply in the ADGM, and Sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions which may apply to a Relevant Person depending on the Relevant Person\\'s jurisdiction of origin, its business and/or customer base.\\n2.Guidance.5. Chapter \\u200e1 specifies who is ultimately responsible for a Relevant Person\\'s compliance with the AML Rulebook. The Regulator expects the Governing Body and Senior Management of a Relevant Person to establish a robust and effective AML/TFS compliance culture for the business.\\n2.Guidance.6. Chapter \\u200e2 provides an overview of the AML Rulebook and Chapter \\u200e3 sets out the key definitions in the AML Rulebook.\\n2.Guidance.7. Chapter \\u200e4 outlines the general compliance requirements including Group policies, notifications, record-keeping requirements and the annual AML Return.\\n2.Guidance.8. Chapter \\u200e5 explains the meaning of the risk-based approach (\"RBA\"), which should be applied when complying with the AML Rulebook. The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person\\'s business, in Chapter \\u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \\u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \\u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \\u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \\u200e8. This overlap may occur at the initial stages of onboarding of customers but may also occur when undertaking ongoing CDD.\\n2.Guidance.9. Chapter \\u200e9 sets out where a Relevant Person may rely on a third party to undertake all or some of its CDD obligations. Reliance on third-party CDD reduces the need to duplicate CDD already performed for a customer. Alternatively, a Relevant Person may outsource some or all of its CDD obligations to a service provider.\\n2.Guidance.10. Chapter \\u200e10 sets out certain obligations in relation to correspondent banking, wire transfers and other matters which are limited to Authorised Persons, other than a Credit Rating Agency, and Recognised Bodies and, in particular, to banks.\\n2.Guidance.11. Chapter \\u200e11 sets out a Relevant Person\\'s obligations in relation to both Sanctions issued by the UNSC and other Sanctions, and government, regulatory and international findings in relation to money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of weapons of mass destruction (“WMD”).\\n2.Guidance.12. Chapter \\u200e12 sets out the obligation for a Relevant Person to appoint an MLRO and the responsibilities of such a Person.\\n2.Guidance.13. Chapter \\u200e13 sets out the requirements for AML/TFS training and awareness. A Relevant Person should adopt the RBA when complying with Chapter \\u200e13, so as to make its training and awareness proportionate to the money laundering risks of the business and the role of the relevant Employee(s).\\n2.Guidance.14. Chapter \\u200e14 contains the obligations applying to all Relevant Persons concerning Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports, which are required to be made under Federal AML Legislation.\\n2.Guidance.15. Chapter \\u200e15 sets out additional obligations applying to DNFBPs, including registration and notification requirements.\\n2.Guidance.16. Chapter \\u200e16 sets out the obligations applying to Relevant Persons that are NPOs.\\n\\n\\n2.Guidance.17. The U.A.E. criminal law. Under Article 3 of Federal Decree By Law No. 20 of 2018, a Relevant Person may be criminally liable for the offence of money laundering if such an activity is intentionally committed in its name or for its account. Relevant Persons are also reminded that:\\n(a)\\tthe failure to report suspicions of money laundering;\\n(b)\\t\"tipping off\"; and\\n(c)\\tassisting in the commission of money laundering,\\nmay each constitute a criminal offence that is punishable under the laws of the U.A.E.\\n2.Guidance.18. The U.A.E. criminal law. Under Article 27 of Federal Decree Law No. (20) of 2018 on Anti-Money Laundering, Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations, Relevant Persons and their Directors and Employees are protected from criminal, civil or administrative penalty or sanction when providing any information, including confidential information, as part of a good faith report made pursuant to Federal AML Legislation to relevant regulatory bodies.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.Guidance.19. Financial Action Task Force Standards. The Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) is an inter-governmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of international standards to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\\n2.Guidance.20. Financial Action Task Force Standards. The Regulator has had regard to the FATF Recommendations in making these Rules and has determined to closely align these Rules with the FATF Recommendations, where that is deemed to be necessary and appropriate. A Relevant Person may wish to refer to the FATF Recommendations and Interpretive Notes to assist it in complying with these Rules. However, in the event that a FATF Recommendation or Interpretive Note conflicts with a Rule in the AML Rulebook, the relevant Rule takes precedence.\\n2.Guidance.21. Financial Action Task Force Standards. A Relevant Person may also wish to refer to the FATF typology reports, which may assist in identifying new money laundering threats and provide information on money laundering and terrorist and proliferation financing methods. The FATF typology reports cover many pertinent topics for Relevant Persons, including corruption, new payment methods, money laundering using trusts and Company Service Providers, and vulnerabilities of free trade zones. These typology reports can be found on the FATF website www.fatf-gafi.org.\\n\\n2.Guidance.22. Basel Committee Standards. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has published a set of guidelines for banks (Sound Management of Risks related to Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, January 2014) which are intended to supplement FATF Recommendations. Banks operating in the ADGM should read the Basel Committee guidelines in conjunction with FATF Recommendations and in complying with these Rules.\\n2.Guidance.23. Basel Committee Standards. In the event that any of the Basel Committee guidelines conflict with a Rule in the AML Rulebook, the relevant Rule takes precedence.\\n\\n2.Guidance.24. Wolfsberg Group. The Wolfsberg Group is an association of thirteen global banks that has published guidance aimed at assisting financial institutions in managing money laundering risks (Wolfsberg Statement Guidance on a Risk Based Approach for Managing Money Laundering Risks, March 2006) and in preventing terrorist financing (Wolfsberg Statement on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, January 2002). Banks operating in the ADGM should be familiar with relevant Wolfsberg Group published guidance in conjunction with the FATF Recommendations and in complying with these Rules.\\n2.Guidance.25. Wolfsberg Group. In the event that any part of the Wolfsberg Group published guidance conflicts with a Rule in the AML Rulebook, the relevant Rule takes precedence.\\n\\n2.Guidance.26. Sanctions. The U.A.E., as a member of the United Nations, is required to comply with all Sanctions issued by the UNSC. The U.A.E. also periodically publicises its own Sanctions. Targeted Financial Sanctions (“TFS”) are Sanctions issued by the UNSC or the U.A.E. involving asset freezing and other financial prohibitions targeted at individuals, entities or groups with the aim of combatting terrorism and terrorist financing, and countering the proliferation of WMD.\\n2.Guidance.27. Sanctions. UNSC Sanctions and Sanctions issued or administered by the U.A.E., including Targeted Financial Sanctions, apply in the ADGM.  Relevant Persons must comply with Targeted Financial Sanctions. Sanctions compliance is emphasised by specific obligations contained in the AML Rulebook requiring Relevant Persons to establish and maintain effective systems and controls to comply with applicable Sanctions, including in particular Targeted Financial Sanctions, as set out in Chapter \\u200e11.\\n2.Guidance.28. Sanctions. The FATF has issued guidance on Targeted Financial Sanctions.  Such guidance has been issued to assist in implementing the Targeted Financial Sanctions and activity-based financial prohibitions. This guidance can be found on the FATF website www.fatf-gafi.org.\\n2.Guidance.29. Sanctions. Sanctions and the import and export controls imposed or administered by other national and supranational bodies may apply or be relevant to a Relevant Person or its operations and the conduct of its business. In particular, Sanctions administered by the European Union, the U.K. (“HM Treasury”) and the U.S. (Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)) may need to be carefully considered. The Regulator expects a Relevant Person to consider and take positive steps to ensure compliance where required or appropriate.\\n',\n",
       "  '3. INTERPRETATION AND TERMINOLOGY\\n3.1 Interpretation\\n3.1.1 A reference in the AML Rulebook to \"money laundering\" in lower case includes terrorist financing, proliferation financing, the financing of unlawful organisations and sanctions non-compliance including non-compliance with Targeted Financial Sanctions, unless the context provides or implies otherwise.\\n3.2 Glossary for AML\\n3.2.Guidance Guidance on the term \"customer\"\\n3.2.Guidance.1.

However, the Regulator considers that it would usually occur at or prior to the business relationship being formalised, for example, by the signing of a client agreement or the acceptance by the customer of terms of business.\\n3.2.Guidance.2. The Regulator does not consider that a Person would be a customer of a Relevant Person merely because such Person receives marketing information from a Relevant Person or where a Relevant Person refers a Person who is not a customer to a third party, including a Group member.\\n3.2.Guidance.3. The Regulator considers that a Counterparty would generally be a customer for the purposes of the AML Rulebook and would therefore require a Relevant Person to undertake CDD on such a Person. However, this would not include a counterparty in a Transaction undertaken on a Regulated Exchange. Nor would it include suppliers of ancillary business services for consumption by the Relevant Person such as cleaning, catering, stationery, IT or other similar services.\\n3.2.Guidance.4.

or\\n(d)\\tbecomes aware of a significant breach of a Rule in the AML Rulebook or breach of relevant Federal AML Legislation.\\n4.4.2 A Relevant Person must inform the Regulator in writing as soon as possible if, in the course of its activities carried on in or from the ADGM, it suspects or becomes aware that another Person outside of its business is engaged in:\\n(a)\\tmoney laundering, contrary to relevant Federal AML Legislation;\\n(b)\\ta breach of Sanctions; or\\n(c)\\tacts amounting to bribery under the OECD Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.\\nThis requirement does not apply to information or documents that are legally privileged or in the public domain.\\n4.5 Record keeping\\n4.5.1 A Relevant Person must, where relevant, maintain the following records:\\n(a)\\ta copy of all documents and information obtained in undertaking initial and ongoing CDD or due diligence on business partners;\\n(b)\\trecords, consisting of the original documents or certified copies, in respect of the customer business relationship, including:\\n(i)\\tbusiness correspondence and other information relating to a customer’s account;\\n(ii)\\tsufficient records of transactions to enable individual transactions to be reconstructed;

This includes the obligation for the Relevant Person to maintain a copy of all documents obtained during initial and ongoing CDD. Where using eKYC for CDD, the Relevant Person should retain all the necessary data gathered during biometric authentication to ensure compliance with applicable Rules.\\n4.5.2 A Relevant Person must immediately provide to the Regulator, upon request, or a law enforcement agency, pursuant to a valid and enforceable request or requirement, a copy of the record referred to in Rule 4.5.1.\\n4.5.2.Guidance \\nThe Regulator expects that a Relevant Person will be able to ordinarily provide the records within one Business Day of a request from the Regulator.\\n4.5.3 A Relevant Person must document, and provide to the Regulator immediately, any of the following:\\n(a)\\tthe risk assessment of its business as required by Rule \\u200e\\u200e6.1.1;\\n(b)\\thow the assessment in (a) was used for the purposes of complying with Rule \\u200e6.1.2;\\n(c)\\tthe risk assessment of the customer undertaken under Rule \\u200e\\u200e7.1.1(1)(a); and\\n(d)\\tthe determination made under Rule \\u200e\\u200e7.1.1(1)(b).\\n4.5.4 The records maintained by a Relevant Person must be kept in such a manner that:\\n(a)\\tthe Regulator or another competent third party is able to assess the Relevant Person\\'s compliance with legislation applicable in the ADGM;\\n(b)\\tany Transaction which was processed by or through the Relevant Person on behalf of a customer or other third party can be reconstructed;\\n(c)\\tany customer or third party can be identified;\\n(d)\\tall internal notifications of suspicious activity made to its MLRO under Rule \\u200e14.2.2, and all Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports, can be identified; and\\n(e)\\tthe Relevant Person can satisfy, within an appropriate time, any regulatory enquiry or court order to disclose information.\\n4.5.4.Guidance\\n4.5.4.Guidance.1.

       "  '5. APPLYING A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO AML/TFS\\n5.1 The risk-based approach\\n5.1.1 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tassess and address its money laundering risks under the AML Rulebook by reviewing the risks to which the Relevant Person is exposed as a result of the nature of its business, customers, products, services and any other matters which are relevant in the context of money laundering; and\\n(b)\\tensure that any risk-based assessment undertaken for the purposes of complying with a requirement in the AML Rulebook is:\\n(i)\\tobjective and proportionate to the risks;\\n(ii)\\tbased on reasonable grounds;\\n(iii)\\tproperly documented; and\\n(iv)\\tupdated at appropriate intervals.\\n5.1.1.Guidance\\n5.1.1.Guidance.1. Rule \\u200e5.1.1 requires a Relevant Person to adopt an approach to AML/TFS which is proportionate to the risks. This is called the \"risk-based approach\" (\"RBA\"). The Regulator expects the RBA to be a key part of the Relevant Person\\'s AML/TFS compliance culture and to cascade down from the Senior Management to the rest of the organisation. Embedding the RBA within its business allows a Relevant Person to make decisions and allocate AML/TFS resources in the most efficient and effective way.\\n5.1.1.Guidance.2. In implementing the RBA, a Relevant Person is expected to have in place processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate money laundering risks. The general principle is that where there are higher risks of money laundering, a Relevant Person is required to take enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks. Correspondingly, when the risks are lower, simplified measures are permitted. Simplified measures are not permitted where there is a suspicion of money laundering.\\n5.1.1.Guidance.3. The RBA should not be seen as a \"tick-box\" approach to AML/TFS. Instead a Relevant Person is required to assess relevant money laundering risks and adopt a proportionate response to such risks, however, even where a customer is assessed through the RBA as being low-risk a minimum of simplified CDD must be undertaken in relation to that customer.\\n5.1.1.Guidance.4. In adopting an RBA, a Relevant Person should continue to meet the requirements that are mandated under the AML Rulebook including:\\n(a)\\tassessing the relevant money laundering risks in accordance with Chapter \\u200e6 or Chapter \\u200e7 of AML (as applicable);\\n(b)\\tundertaking CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.3.1;\\n(c)\\tundertaking Enhanced CDD pursuant to Rule \\u200e8.1.1(3) in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.4.1; and\\n(d)\\tundertaking Simplified CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.5.1 where permissible pursuant to Rule \\u200e8.1.1(4).\\n5.1.1.Guidance.5. Section 4.5 sets out the requirements regarding record-keeping for the purposes of the AML Rulebook. These Rules apply in relation to Rule \\u200e5.1.1(b)(iii).\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \"6. BUSINESS RISK ASSESSMENT\\n6.1 Assessing the money laundering risks of a business\\n6.1.1 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\ttake appropriate steps to identify and assess money laundering risks to which its business is exposed, taking into consideration the nature, size and complexity of its activities. Relevant Persons must take into account that money laundering risks include the risk of terrorist financing, proliferation financing, the financing of unlawful organisations and sanctions non-compliance including non-compliance with Targeted Financial Sanctions.\\n(b)\\twhen identifying and assessing the risks in (a), take into account, to the extent relevant, any vulnerabilities relating to:\\n(i)\\tits type of customers and their activities;\\n(ii)\\tthe countries or geographic areas in which it does business;\\n(iii)\\tits products, services and activity profiles;\\n(iv)\\tits distribution channels and business partners;\\n(v)\\tthe complexity and volume of its Transactions;\\n(vi)\\tthe development of new products and business practices including new delivery mechanisms, channels and partners;\\n(vii)\\tthe use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre existing products and services; and\\n(c)\\ttake appropriate measures to ensure that any risk identified as part of the assessment in (a) is taken into account in its day-to-day operations and is mitigated, including in relation to:\\n(i)\\tthe development of new products;\\n(ii)\\tthe taking on of new customers; and\\n(iii)\\tchanges to its business profile.\\n6.1.2 A Relevant Person must use the information obtained in undertaking its business risk assessment to:\\n(a)\\tdevelop and maintain its AML/TFS policies, procedures, systems and controls as required by Rule \\u200e6.2.1;\\n(b)\\tensure that its AML/TFS policies, procedures, systems and controls adequately mitigate the risks identified as part of the assessment in Rule \\u200e6.1.1;\\n(c)\\tassess the effectiveness of its AML/TFS policies, procedures, systems and controls as required by Rule \\u200e6.2.1(c);\\n(d)\\tassist in the allocation and prioritisation of AML/TFS resources; and\\n(e)\\tassist in the carrying out of the customer risk assessment under Chapter \\u200e7.\\n6.1.3 Without limiting compliance with Rules \\u200e6.1.1 and \\u200e6.1.2, prior to launching any new product, service, or business practice, or using a new or developing technology, a Relevant Person must take reasonable steps to ensure that it has:\\n(a)\\tassessed and identified the money laundering risks relating to the product, service, business practice or technology; and\\n(b)\\ttaken appropriate steps to mitigate or eliminate the risks identified under (a).\\n6.1.3.Guidance\\n6.1.3.Guidance.1. Unless a Relevant Person understands the money laundering risks to which it is exposed, it cannot take appropriate steps to prevent its business from being used for the purposes of money laundering. Money laundering risks vary from business to business depending on the nature of the business, the type of customers a business has, the nature of the products and services sold, and the geographical operations in which it operates.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.2. Using the RBA, a Relevant Person should assess its own vulnerabilities to money laundering and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks. The results of this assessment will also feed into the Relevant Person's risk assessment of its customers under Chapter \\u200e7.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.3. In addition to assessing risk arising from money laundering, a business risk assessment should assess the potential exposure of a Relevant Person to other Financial Crime, such as fraud and the theft of personal data. The business risk assessment should also address the Relevant Person’s potential exposure to cyber security risk, as this risk may have a material impact on the Relevant Person’s ability to prevent Financial Crime.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.4. A Relevant Person should, as a separate and distinct element of its business risk assessment, undertake a Targeted Financial Sanctions risk assessment in order to identify, understand, assess and mitigate those risks. This should include conducting a proliferation financing and terrorist financing risk assessment.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.5. A Relevant Person should, prior to launching any new product, service or business practice, pay specific attention to assessing the potential for risks associated with all applicable aspects of Financial Crime. This is especially important given the innovative nature of any such new offering as the Relevant Person may be less familiar with the functioning of the offering, compared to existing offerings.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.6. Similarly, in using a new or developing technology, such as those associated with the Regulated Activity of Developing Financial Technology Services within the RegLab or when undertaking NFTF business, a Relevant Person should pay specific attention to assessing the potential for risks associated with Financial Crime that might arise as a result of implementing that innovative technology. For example, while the use of eKYC Systems may reduce the risk of impersonation fraud at customer onboarding, NFTF interaction with the customer may increase the risk of Financial Crime after a business relationship has been established, through transaction fraud, money laundering or theft of digitally stored CDD documentation.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.7. A business risk assessment under Rule \\u200e6.1.1(b) should include an assessment of the risks associated with the carrying on of NFTF business, particularly the use of eKYC Systems. The assessment should consider incorporating any relevant mitigation measures identified by the Regulator, a competent authority of the U.A.E., FATF, and any other relevant bodies.\\n\\n\\n6.2 AML/TFS systems and controls\\n6.2.1 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\testablish and maintain effective policies, procedures, systems and controls to prevent opportunities for money laundering in relation to the Relevant Person and its activities;\\n(b)\\tensure that its systems and controls in (a):\\n(i)\\tinclude the provision to the Relevant Person's Senior Management of regular management information on the operation and effectiveness of its AML/TFS systems and controls necessary to identify, measure, manage and control the Relevant Person's money laundering risks;\\n(ii)\\tenable it to determine whether a customer or a Beneficial Owner is a PEP;\\n(iii)\\tenable the Relevant Person to comply with these Rules and Federal AML Legislation; and\\n(iv)\\tenable the Relevant Person to comply with the Penal Code; and\\n(c)\\tensure that regular risk assessments are carried out on the adequacy of the Relevant Person's AML/TFS systems and controls to ensure that they continue to enable it to identify, assess, monitor and manage money laundering risk adequately, and are comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of its activities.\\n6.2.1.Guidance\\n6.2.1.Guidance.1. In Rule \\u200e6.2.1(c) the frequency of risk assessments will depend on the nature, size and complexity of the Relevant Person's business and also on when any material changes are made to its business. The risk assessments should also take into account a range of financial crime, including fraud, bribery and corruption.\\n6.2.1.Guidance.2. The risk assessment under Rule \\u200e6.2.1(c) should identify actions to mitigate risks associated with undertaking NFTF business generally, and the use of eKYC specifically. This is because distinct risks are often likely to arise where business is conducted entirely in an NFTF manner, compared to when the business relationship includes a mix of face-to-face and NFTF interactions. The assessment should make reference to risk mitigation measures recommended by the Regulator, a competent authority of the U.A.E., FATF, and other relevant bodies.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  '7. CUSTOMER RISK ASSESSMENT\\n7.Guidance\\n7.Guidance.1. This Chapter prescribes the risk-based assessment that must be undertaken by a Relevant Person on a customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product. The outcome of this process is to produce a risk rating for a customer, which determines the level of CDD that must be undertaken in relation to that customer under Chapter \\u200e8. Chapter \\u200e8 prescribes the requirements of CDD, Enhanced CDD for high-risk customers and, where appropriate, Simplified CDD for low-risk customers.\\n7.Guidance.2. CDD in the context of AML/TFS refers to the process of identifying a customer, verifying such identification and monitoring the customer\\'s business and the potential for any money laundering risk on an ongoing basis. CDD is required to be completed following a risk-based assessment of the customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product.\\n7.Guidance.3. Relevant Persons should note that the ongoing CDD requirements in Rule \\u200e\\u200e8.6.1 require a Relevant Person to review a customer\\'s risk rating to ensure that it remains appropriate in light of the potential money laundering risks.\\n7.Guidance.4. The risk-based assessment of the customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product required under this Chapter is required to be undertaken prior to the establishment of a business relationship with a customer. Because the risk rating assigned to a customer resulting from this assessment determines the level of CDD that must be undertaken for that customer, this process must be completed before the CDD is completed for the customer. The Regulator is aware that in practice there will often be some degree of overlap between the customer risk assessment and CDD. For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment. Where information obtained as part of CDD of a customer affects the risk rating of a customer, the change in risk rating should be reflected in the degree of CDD undertaken.\\n7.1 Assessing the money laundering risks of a customer\\n7.1.1\\n7.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tundertake a risk-based assessment of every customer; and\\n(b)\\tassign the customer a risk rating proportionate to the assessed money laundering risks associated with the customer.\\n7.1.1.(2) The customer risk assessment in (1) must be completed:\\n(a)\\tprior to establishing a business relationship with a customer;\\n(b)\\ton a periodic basis, in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.6.1(e); and\\n(c)\\twhenever it is otherwise appropriate for existing customers, including where the Relevant Person becomes aware of any change to the risk factors associated with the customer that might contribute to the potential for money laundering risk to increase materially.\\n7.1.1.(3) When undertaking a risk-based assessment of a customer under \\u200e7.1.1(1)\\u200e(a), a Relevant Person must identify, assess and consider:\\n(a)\\tthe customer and any Beneficial Owners;\\n(b)\\tthe purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, and the nature of the customer’s business;\\n(c)\\tthe nature, ownership and control structure of the customer, its beneficial ownership (if any) and its business;\\n(d)\\tthe customer\\'s country of origin, residence, nationality, place of incorporation or place of business;\\n(e)\\tthe relevant product, service or Transaction;\\n(f)\\tin relation to life insurance or other similar insurance policies, the beneficiary of the policy and Beneficial Owners of the beneficiary;

The risk assessment of a customer requires a Relevant Person to allocate an appropriate risk rating to the customer. Risk ratings should be either descriptive, such as \"low”, “medium” or \"high\", or a sliding, ordinal numeric scale such as 1 for the lowest risk to 10 for the highest, with at least three differentiated risk ratings. All the factors set out in both \\u200e7.1.2 and \\u200e7.1.3 should be considered in order to assess and allocate the appropriate risk rating to the customer.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on the customer risk assessment.2. Depending on the outcome of a Relevant Person\\'s assessment of its customer\\'s money laundering risk, a Relevant Person should decide to what degree CDD will need to be performed. For a customer exhibiting significant potential risk for money laundering the Relevant Person is required to carry out Enhanced CDD under Rule \\u200e8.4, in addition to the normal CDD required under Rule \\u200e8.3. For a customer rated low risk, the Relevant Person may be able to carry out Simplified CDD under Rule \\u200e8.5. For any other customer, the Relevant Person must undertake CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on the customer risk assessment.3. Using the RBA, a Relevant Person could, when assessing two customers with near identical risk profiles, consider that one is high-risk and the other low-risk. This may occur, for example, where both customers may be undertaking the same high-risk activity, but one customer may be a customer in relation to a low-risk product, or may be a long-standing customer of a Group company which has been introduced to the Relevant Person.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on high-risk customers\\n7.1.3.Guidance on high-risk customers .1. When assessing the risk factors referred to in \\u200e7.1.2(1), the presence of one or more risk factors may not always indicate a high risk of money laundering in a particular situation.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on high-risk customers .2. An example of a business relationship conducted in unusual circumstances, for the purposes of Rule \\u200e7.1.2(1)(a)(i), would include, but is not limited to a business relationship or proposed business relationship that involves, or would involve, significant unexplained geographic distance between the location of the Relevant Person and the customer or proposed customer.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on high-risk customers .3. The highest risk products or services in respect of money laundering are those where unlimited third-party funds can be freely received from or paid to third parties, without evidence of the identity of the third parties being obtained and the identity being verified.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on high-risk customers .4. Money laundering risks are likely to be increased if a Person is able to hide behind corporate structures such as limited companies, trusts, special purpose vehicles and nominee arrangements. When devising its internal procedures, a Relevant Person should consider how its customers and operational systems impact the capacity of its staff to identify suspicious activities and Transactions. Generally, the lowest risk products in respect of money laundering are those where funds can only be received from a named customer by way of payment from an account held in the customer\\'s name, and similarly where the funds can only be remitted to a named customer.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on low-risk customers \\nWhen assessing the risk factors referred to in \\u200e7.1.3(1), a Relevant Person must bear in mind that the presence or absence of one or more risk factors may not always indicate a high or low risk of money laundering respectively in a particular situation.\\n7.2 Prohibition on establishing business relationships with certain customers\\n7.2.1 A Relevant Person must not establish a business relationship with a prospective customer that is a Legal Person or Legal Arrangement if the ownership or control arrangements of the customer prevents the Relevant Person from identifying one or more of the customer\\'s Beneficial Owners.\\n7.2.2 A Relevant Person must not establish or maintain a business relationship with a Shell Bank.\\n7.2.3 A Relevant Person must not knowingly establish or maintain an anonymous account, an account in a fictitious name, or a nominee account which is held in the name of one Person but which is controlled by or held for the benefit of another Person whose true identity has not been disclosed to the Relevant Person.\\n7.2.3.Guidance\\n7.2.3.Guidance.1. In Rule \\u200e7.2.1, ownership arrangements which may prevent the Relevant Person from identifying one or more Beneficial Owners include bearer shares and other negotiable instruments in which ownership is determined by possession.\\n7.2.3.Guidance.2. A Shell Bank is a bank that has no physical presence in the country in which it is incorporated and licensed, and which is unaffiliated with a regulated financial Group that is subject to effective consolidated supervision. The Regulator does not consider that the existence of a local agent or low-level staff constitutes physical presence.\\n7.2.4 If a Relevant Person uses a numbered account with an abbreviated name, it must ensure that:\\n(a)\\tsuch an account is used only for internal purposes;\\n(b)\\tit has undertaken the same CDD procedures in relation to the account holder as are required for other account holders;\\n(c)\\tit maintains the same information in relation to the account and account holder as is required for other accounts and account holders; and\\n(d)\\tstaff performing AML/TFS functions, including staff responsible for identifying and monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, and staff performing compliance and audit functions, have full access to information about the account and the account holder.\\n7.2.4.Guidance on anonymous accounts \\nA Relevant Person should note that, in addition to the prohibition in Rule 7.2.3 against knowingly establishing anonymous accounts, accounts in a fictitious name or nominee accounts, the Federal AML Legislation also prohibits the opening of accounts held under borrowed, mock or fake names or accounts designated solely with numbers and without the names of account holders.\\n7.2.4.Guidance on Restricted Scope Companies\\n7.2.4.Guidance on Restricted Scope Companies.1. A Restricted Scope Company is a corporate vehicle offering a greater degree of confidentiality than other forms of corporate entity in the ADGM. Restricted Scope Companies are not required to file accounts and are not required to have their accounts audited. Restricted Scope Companies must file an annual return, articles, and details of their registered offices, directors and secretary (if they have one) with the ADGM Registrar of Companies.\\n7.2.4.Guidance on Restricted Scope Companies.2. Relevant Persons will know that Restricted Scope Companies are subject to less onerous corporate disclosure requirements than other forms of corporate entities due to the requirement to have \"(Restricted)\" in a company\\'s name. Given that only the constitution and details of the registered office of a Restricted Scope Company will be available in a public register, a Relevant Person will be required to have a bilateral dialogue with the Restricted Scope Company, in accordance with the RBA, to obtain any other relevant information which it needs to assess the money laundering risks to which it is exposed.\\n7.2.4.Guidance on Restricted Scope Companies.3. Restricted Scope Companies should be forthcoming with relevant information in response to requests by other Persons and entities for the purpose of compliance of the latter with the requirements in the AML Rulebook. The fact that Restricted Scope Companies are not subject to strict standards of disclosure of corporate documentation to a public registry should not be interpreted by Restricted Scope Companies to limit or prohibit their providing of any relevant information to other Persons and entities for AML/TFS purposes.\\n\\n',\n",

CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE\\n8.1 Requirement to undertake Customer Due Diligence\\n8.1.1\\n8.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person that is an Authorised Person or a Recognised Body must undertake CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.1 where the Relevant Person:\\n(a)\\testablishes a business relationship with a customer;\\n(b)\\tcarries out an occasional Transaction for a customer that is of an amount equal to or more than USD15,000;\\n(c)\\tsuspects a customer of, or a Transaction to be for the purposes of, money laundering; or\\n(d)\\tdoubts the veracity or adequacy of any documents or information previously provided by, or obtained for, a customer in relation to (a), (b) or (c) above.\\n8.1.1.(2) A Relevant Person that is a DNFBP must undertake CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.1 where it:\\n(a)\\tis a real estate agency and it prepares for or is involved in a Transaction, or the provision of real estate agency services to a Person, that involves the buying and selling of real property;\\n(b)\\tis a dealer in precious metals or precious stones and it is involved in a Transaction in cash that amounts to USD15,000 or more, whether or not the Transaction is executed in a single operation or in several operations that are or appear to be linked;\\n(c)\\tis a dealer in any saleable item of a price equal to or greater than USD15,000 and it is involved in a Transaction in cash that amounts to USD15,000 or more, whether or not the Transaction is executed in a single operation or in several operations that are or appear to be linked;\\n(d)\\tis an accounting firm, audit firm, insolvency firm or taxation consulting firm and it prepares for or is involved in the provision of accounting, auditing, insolvency or taxation consulting services to a Person;\\n(e)\\tis a law firm, notary firm or other independent legal business and it prepares for or is involved in the provision of legal or notarial services to another Person participating in financial or real property Transactions concerning the following activities:\\n(i)\\tthe buying and selling of real property;\\n(ii)\\tthe managing of client money, securities or other assets;\\n(iii)\\tthe management of bank, savings or securities accounts;\\n(iv)\\tthe organisation of contributions for the creation, operation or management of companies; or\\n(v)\\tthe creation, operation or management of legal persons or arrangements, and buying and selling of business entities;\\n(f)\\tis a Company Service Provider and it prepares for or is involved in the provision of any of the following services to another Person:\\n(i)\\tacting as a formation agent of Legal Persons or Legal Arrangements;\\n(ii)\\tacting as, or arranging for another Person to act as, a director or secretary of a company, a partner of a partnership, or a similar position in relation to other Legal Persons or Legal Arrangements;\\n(iii)\\tproviding a registered office, business address or accommodation, correspondence or administrative address for a company, a partnership or any other Legal Person or Legal Arrangement;\\n(iv)\\tacting as, or arranging for another Person to act as, a trustee of an express trust or performing the equivalent function for another form of Legal Arrangement; or\\n(v)\\tacting as, or arranging for another Person to act as, a nominee shareholder for another Person.\\n8.1.1.(3) In addition to undertaking CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.3.1, a Relevant Person must undertake Enhanced CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.4.1 for each of its customers assigned a high-risk rating;\\n8.1.1.(4) A Relevant Person may undertake Simplified CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.5.1 by modifying the CDD undertaken in accordance with Rule \\u200e\\u200e8.3.1 for any customer assigned a low-risk rating.\\n8.1.1.Guidance\\n8.1.1.Guidance.1. Relevant Persons are reminded that they are required to comply with notices and guidance issued pursuant to Federal AML Legislation in relation to CDD, including those issued by the FIU relating to CDD and filings required in goAML.\\n8.1.1.Guidance.2. The FIU has issued guides that require:\\n(a)\\ta DNFBP that is a dealer in precious metals or precious stones to obtain relevant identification documents, such as passport, emirates ID, trade licence, as applicable, and register the information via goAML for all cash transactions equal to or exceeding USD15,000 with individuals and all cash or wire transfer transactions equal to or exceeding USD15,000 with entities. The Regulator expects a dealer in any saleable item or a price equal to or greater than USD15,000 to also comply with this requirement;\\n(b)\\ta DNFBP that is a real estate agent to obtain relevant identification documents, such as passport, emirates ID, trade licence, as applicable, and register the information via goAML for all sales or purchases of Real Property where:\\n(i)\\tthe payment for the sale/purchase includes a total cash payment of USD15,000 or more whether in a single cash payment or multiple cash payments;\\n(ii)\\tthe payment for any part or all of the sale/purchase amount includes payment(s) using Virtual Assets;\\n(iii)\\tthe payment for any part or all of the sale/purchase amount includes funds that were converted from or to a Virtual Asset.\\n8.1.2\\n8.1.2.(1) A Relevant Person must also apply CDD measures to each existing customer under Rules \\u200e8.3.1, \\u200e8.4.1 or \\u200e8.5.1 as applicable:\\n(a)\\twith a frequency appropriate to the outcome of the risk-based approach taken in relation to each customer; and\\n(b)\\twhen the Relevant Person becomes aware that any circumstances relevant to its risk assessment for a customer have changed.\\n8.1.2.(2) For the purposes of \\u200e8.1.2(1), in determining when it is appropriate to apply CDD measures in relation to existing customers, a Relevant Person must take into account, amongst other things:\\n(a)\\tany indication that the identity of the customer, or the customer’s Beneficial Owners, has changed;\\n(b)\\tany Transactions that are not reasonably consistent with the Relevant Person’s knowledge of the customer;\\n(c)\\tany change in the purpose or intended nature of the Relevant Person’s relationship with the customer; or\\n(d)\\tany other matter that might affect the Relevant Person’s risk assessment of the customer.\\n8.1.2.Guidance\\n8.1.2.Guidance.1. A Relevant Person should undertake appropriate CDD in a manner proportionate to the customer\\'s money laundering risks. This means that all customers are subject to CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.1. However, for high-risk customers, additional Enhanced Customer Due Diligence measures should also be undertaken under Rule \\u200e8.4.1. For customers having a low-risk rating, the requirements under Rule \\u200e8.3.1 may be modified according to the assessed risk, in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.5.1.\\n8.1.2.Guidance.2. The frequency for undertaking CDD for existing customers will be determined by the risk rating assigned to a particular customer. The Regulator expects that customers rated high risk for money laundering should be reviewed more frequently than customers rated lower risk for money laundering.\\n8.1.2.Guidance.3. A Relevant Person should undertake CDD to guard against a range of money laundering risks as well as a range of financial crime risks, including fraud.\\n8.2 Timing of Customer Due Diligence\\n8.2.1\\n8.2.1.(1) For a Relevant Person that is an Authorised Person or Recognised Body:\\n(a)\\tthe appropriate CDD obligations, subject to (1)(b), must be fulfilled before the Relevant Person undertakes any Transaction on behalf of the customer or when undertaking an occasional transaction under \\u200e8.1.1(1)(b).\\n(b)\\tthe Relevant Person does not have to fulfil the verification of the identity of a customer and Beneficial Owners obligations under the AML Rules before undertaking a Transaction for a customer or occasional transaction where it has, on reasonable grounds, established that:\\n(i)\\tthere is little risk of money laundering and that risk is effectively managed; and\\n(ii)\\tdoing so would interrupt or delay the normal course of business in respect of effecting the Transaction.\\n8.2.1.(2) (a)\\tA Relevant Person that is a DNFBP must fulfil the appropriate CDD and reporting obligations where applicable before the Relevant Person prepares for or carries out a Transaction or provision of a service in Rule \\u200e8.1.1(2)(a), (d), (e) or (f).\\n(b)\\tA Relevant Person that is a DNFBP as a result of carrying on one or more of the business activities referred to in Rule \\u200e8.1.1(2)(b) or (c) must fulfil the appropriate CDD and reporting obligations where applicable before the Relevant Person prepares for or carries out a transaction that includes a total cash payment of USD15,000 or more, whether in a single cash payment or multiple cash payments.\\n8.2.1.(3) The Relevant Person does not have to fulfil the verification of the identity of a customer and Beneficial Owners obligations under the AML Rules preparing for or carrying out a Transaction for its customer concerning those business activities referred to in Rule \\u200e8.1.1(2) where it has, on reasonable grounds, established that:\\n(i)\\tthere is little risk of money laundering and that risk is effectively managed; and\\n(ii)\\tdoing so would interrupt or delay the normal course of business in respect of effecting the Transaction.\\n8.2.1.(4) A Relevant Person that has relied on Rule \\u200e8.2.1(1)(b) or \\u200e8.2.1(3) must fulfil its CDD obligations as soon as practicable after effecting the Transaction.\\n8.2.1.(5) Where the Relevant Person, having relied on Rule \\u200e8.2.1(1)(b) or \\u200e8.2.1(3) is unable to complete the verification of the identity of a customer and any Beneficial Owners within twenty Business Days of effecting a Transaction or occasional transaction it must:\\n(a)\\tconsider the circumstances and determine whether to make an internal notification of suspicious activity to the MLRO under Rule \\u200e14.2.2;\\n(b)\\twhere it has determined that it is unnecessary to make such a report, return to the customer any monies associated with the Transaction or occasional transaction, excluding any reasonable costs incurred by the Relevant Person;\\n(c)\\twhere it has determined that it is necessary to make such a report, not return any monies or provide any investments to the customer, unless instructed to do so by the MLRO and otherwise act in accordance with instructions issued by the MLRO; and\\n(d)\\tnot establish any further business relationship with that customer until the verification process has been completed for that customer in accordance with these Rules.\\n8.2.2\\n8.2.2.(1) A Relevant Person must ensure that its AML/TFS systems and controls referred to in Rule \\u200e6.2.1 include risk management policies and procedures concerning the conditions under which business relationships may be established with a customer before completing verification of the identity of a customer and Beneficial Owners.\\n8.2.2.Guidance\\n8.2.2.Guidance.1. Examples of situations that might lead a Relevant Person to have doubts about the veracity or adequacy of documents, data or information previously obtained might be where: there is a suspicion of money laundering in relation to that customer; there is a material change in the way that the customer\\'s account is operated which is not consistent with the customer\\'s business profile; or it appears to the Relevant Person that a Person other than the nominal customer is the real customer.\\n8.2.2.Guidance.2. Situations that the Relevant Person may take into account include, for example, accepting subscription monies during a short offer period or executing a time critical Transaction which, if not executed immediately, would or may cause a customer to incur a financial loss due to price movement or loss of opportunity or when a customer seeks immediate insurance cover.\\n8.2.2.Guidance.3. When complying with Rule \\u200e8.2.1, a Relevant Person should also, where relevant, consider Rule \\u200e8.7.1 regarding failure to conduct or complete CDD and Chapter \\u200e\\u200e14 regarding Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports and tipping off.\\n8.3 Customer Due Diligence requirements\\n8.3.1\\n8.3.1.(1) In undertaking CDD a Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tidentify the customer and verify the customer’s identity including identification and verification of the identity of any Person purporting to act on behalf of the customer;\\n(b)\\tidentify all the Beneficial Owners and take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the Beneficial Owners, such that the Relevant Person is satisfied that it knows who the Beneficial Owners are;\\n(c)\\tassess and understand and, as appropriate, obtain information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship; and\\n(d)\\tconduct ongoing due diligence of the business relationship as required under Rule \\u200e\\u200e8.6.1.\\n8.3.1.(2) In addition to complying with \\u200e(a), for life insurance or other similar policies a Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\trecord the names of any beneficiaries named in the policy;\\n(b)\\tverify the identity of all Persons in all classes of beneficiaries when a payout of the policy is due;\\n(c)\\tundertake the measures referred to in (a) and (b) as soon as the beneficiary of the policy is identified or designated; and\\n(d)\\tverify the identity of beneficiaries and any Beneficial Owners of a beneficiary before it makes a payout under the policy.\\n8.3.1.(3) A Relevant Person must have systems and controls in place and take reasonable measures to determine whether:\\n(a)\\ta customer,\\n(b)\\tany Beneficial Owners of the customer; or\\n(c)\\tfor a life insurance or other similar policy, any beneficiary of the policy, or any Beneficial Owners of a beneficiary;\\nis a PEP.\\n8.3.1.(4) If a PEP is identified under (3), then the Relevant Person must, in addition to CDD under \\u200e8.3.1, undertake Enhanced CDD under \\u200e8.4.1.\\n8.3.2\\n8.3.2.(1) For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(a), a Relevant Person must identify a customer and verify the customer’s identity in accordance with this Rule.\\n8.3.2.(2) If a customer is a Natural Person, a Relevant Person must obtain and verify information about the person’s:\\n(a)\\tfull name (including any alias);\\n(b)\\tdate of birth;\\n(c)\\tnationality;\\n(d)\\tlegal domicile; and\\n(e)\\tcurrent residential address, other than a post office box.\\n8.3.2.(3) If a customer is a Body Corporate, the Relevant Person must obtain and verify:\\n(a)\\tthe full name of the Body Corporate and any trading name;\\n(b)\\tthe address of its registered office and, if different, its principal place of business;\\n(c)\\tthe date and place of incorporation or registration;\\n(d)\\trelevant corporate documents of the customer; and\\n(e)\\tthe full names of the members of its Governing Body and persons exercising a senior management position.\\n8.3.2.(4) If a customer is a foundation, the Relevant Person must obtain and verify:\\n(a)\\ta certified copy of the charter and by-laws of the foundation or any other documents constituting the foundation; and\\n(b)\\tdocumentary evidence of the appointment of the guardian or any other person who may exercise powers in respect of the foundation.\\n8.3.2.(5) If a customer is a trust or other similar Legal Arrangement, the Relevant Person must obtain and verify:\\n(a)\\ta certified copy of the trust deed or other documents that set out the nature, purpose and terms of the trust or arrangement; and\\n(b)\\tdocumentary evidence of the appointment of the trustee or any other person exercising powers under the trust or arrangement.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.1. The information required under \\u200e8.3.2(2)(a) and (b) should be obtained through a review of an original current, valid passport or, where a customer does not own a passport, an official identification document which includes a photograph. For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.2(2)(a) and (b) an official government identification document in digital form and issued by a governmental competent authority is considered valid.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.2. A Relevant Person should ensure that any documents used for the purpose of identification are original documents, whichever format they are in, including digital.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.3. The verification of a customer’s identity, including their address, should be based on official documents. Where that is not possible, a Relevant Person should consider using additional documents or information obtained from different independent sources to verify identity. Any lack of official documents and alternative means of verification should lead the Relevant Person to re-assess the customer’s risk classification and the associated level of due diligence to be undertaken.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.4. For residents of the U.A.E., the UAE Pass may be used to identify and verify the identity of a customer who is a Natural Person, and thereby satisfy the requirement to verify the address of that customer only where the UAE Pass is duly authenticated by the Relevant Person.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.5. The Relevant Person must always verify the address of a customer subject to Enhanced Customer Due Diligence under Rule \\u200e8.4.1.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.6. Where personal identity documents, such as a passport, identity card or other identification documentation cannot be reviewed in original form, the identification documentation provided should be certified as a true copy of the original document by any one of the following:\\n(a)\\ta registered lawyer;\\n(b)\\ta registered notary;\\n(c)\\ta chartered accountant;\\n(d)\\ta government ministry;\\n(e)\\ta post office;\\n(f)\\ta police officer; or\\n(g)\\tan embassy or consulate.\\nThe individual or authority undertaking the certification should be contactable if necessary.\\nWhere a copy of an original identification document is made by a Relevant Person, the copy should be dated, signed and marked with \\'original sighted\\'.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.7. In complying with Rule \\u200e8.3.2(2), a Relevant Person should take reasonable steps to identify whether a customer has more than one nationality or residency rights in jurisdictions other than their jurisdiction of birth. The existence of such residency rights or dual nationality may be a potential risk factor and should be considered as such in the customer risk assessment required by Rule \\u200e7.1.1(3) and Rule \\u200e7.1.2.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.8. Where a Relevant Person uses eKYC for CDD purposes appropriate measures must be adopted to mitigate the risks that may arise from eKYC processes and the use of an eKYC System. A Relevant Person must ensure that eKYC is secure and effective, includes an appropriate combination of authentication factors when verifying the identity of the customer and ensure it is at least as stringent as face-to-face CDD. Measures should be in place to verify the authenticity of any official government identification document and the actual customer. A Relevant Person should also apply guidance on technical standards for biometric authentication issued by the Regulator or a competent authority of the U.A.E., as applicable.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.9. When employing an eKYC System to assist with CDD, a Relevant Person should:\\na.\\tensure that it has a thorough understanding of the eKYC System itself and the risks of eKYC, including those outlined by relevant guidance from FATF and other international standard setting bodies;\\nb.\\tcomply with all the Rules of the Regulator relevant to eKYC including, but not limited to, applicable requirements regarding the business risk assessment, as per Rule \\u200e6.1, and outsourcing, as per Rule \\u200e9.3;\\nc.\\tcombine eKYC with transaction monitoring, anti-fraud and cyber-security measures to support a wider framework preventing applicable Financial Crime; and\\nd.\\ttake appropriate steps to identify, assess and mitigate the risk of the eKYC system being misused for the purposes of Financial Crime.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.10. In undertaking CDD, a Relevant Person that is a Recognised Body should have regard to the provisions of the Market Infrastructure Rulebook (“MIR”) requiring appropriate measures be taken to prevent money laundering, Market Abuse and Financial Crime, including those set out at MIR 2.8.5(c) and MIR 2.9.\\n8.3.3\\n8.3.3.(1) For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(b), and subject to (4), a Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of a Body Corporate in accordance with this Rule.\\n8.3.3.(2) The Relevant Person must identify any Natural Person who:\\n(a)\\towns or controls (in each case whether directly or indirectly) 25% or more of the shares or voting rights in the Body Corporate;\\n(b)\\tcontrols the Body Corporate; or\\n(c)\\texercises ultimate control over the management of the Body Corporate.\\n8.3.3.(3) For the purposes of (2)(b), a Natural Person controls a Body Corporate if such person:\\n(a)\\tholds, directly or indirectly:\\n(i)\\t25% or more of the Body Corporate’s shares;\\n(ii)\\t25% or more of the voting rights in the Body Corporate; or\\n(iii)\\tthe right to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors of the Body Corporate; or\\n(b)\\thas the right to exercise, or actually exercises, significant influence or control over the Body Corporate.\\n8.3.3.(4) A Relevant Person is not required to comply with Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(b) if the customer is:\\n(a)\\ta Listed Body Corporate; or\\n(b)\\ta Body Corporate that is wholly-owned by the Federal Government of the U.A.E., or by any of the governments of the member Emirates of the U.A.E.; or\\n(c)\\ta Body Corporate created by Emiri decree within the U.A.E.\\n8.3.4\\n8.3.4.(1) For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(b), a Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of a Partnership in accordance with this Rule.\\n8.3.4.(2) The Relevant Person must identify any Natural Person who:\\n(a)\\tultimately is entitled to or controls (in each case whether directly or indirectly) a 25% or more share of the capital or profits of the Partnership or 25% or more of the voting rights in the Partnership; or\\n(b)\\totherwise exercises ultimate control over the management of the Partnership.\\n8.3.5\\n8.3.5.(1) For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(b), a Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of a customer that is a trustee of a trust or an equivalent position in respect of a similar Legal Arrangement in accordance with this Rule.\\n8.3.5.(2) The Relevant Person must identify:\\n(a)\\tthe settlor of the trust;\\n(b)\\tany other trustee(s) aside from the customer;\\n(c)\\teach beneficiary of the trust;\\n(d)\\twhere the persons or some of the persons benefiting from the trust have not been determined, the class of persons in whose main interest, in the opinion of the Registrar, the trust has been established or operates; and\\n(e)\\tany Natural Person who has control over the trust.\\n8.3.5.(3) For the purposes of (2)(e) “control” means a power, whether exercisable alone, jointly with another person or with the consent of another person, under the trust instrument or by law to:\\n(a)\\tdispose of, advance, lend, invest, pay or apply trust property;\\n(b)\\tvary or terminate the trust;\\n(c)\\tadd or remove a person as a beneficiary to or from a class of beneficiaries;\\n(d)\\tappoint or remove trustees or give another person control over the trust; and\\n(e)\\tdirect, withhold consent to or veto the exercise of a power mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d).\\n8.3.5.(4) Where any of the persons identified under (2)(a) to (e) are fulfilled by a Body Corporate or Partnership, the Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of Body Corporate or Partnership in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.3.3 and Rule \\u200e8.3.4.\\n8.3.6\\n8.3.6.(1) For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(b), a Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of a customer that is a foundation or other Legal Arrangement similar to a foundation in accordance with this Rule.\\n8.3.6.(2) The Relevant Person must identify:\\n(a)\\tthe founder;\\n(b)\\tthe foundation council members, or otherwise members of the governing body of the foundation;\\n(c)\\tthe guardian, if any;\\n(d)\\tthe beneficiaries, if named, or designee if no beneficiaries are named, in whose main interest, in the opinion of the Relevant Person, the foundation or arrangement has been established or operates; and\\n(e)\\tany Natural Person who has control over the foundation or other Legal Arrangement.\\n8.3.6.(3) For the purposes of (2)(e), a Natural Person shall have “control” over a foundation or a Legal Arrangement if such person:\\n(a)\\tholds, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the voting rights in the conduct and management of the foundation or the Legal Arrangement; or\\n(b)\\tholds the right, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove a majority of the officials of the foundation or the Legal Arrangement.\\n8.3.6.(4) Where any of the persons identified under (2)(a) to (d) are a Body Corporate or Partnership, the Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of Body Corporate or Partnership in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.3.3 and Rule \\u200e8.3.4.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on verification of the identity of Beneficial Owners\\n8.3.6.Guidance on verification of the identity of Beneficial Owners.1. In determining whether an individual meets the definition of Beneficial Owners regard should be had to all the circumstances of the case, in particular the size of an individual\\'s legal engagement or beneficial ownership in a Transaction.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on verification of the identity of Beneficial Owners.2. For a retail investment fund that is widely-held and where the investors invest via pension contributions, the Regulator would not expect the manager of the fund to look through to any underlying investors where there are none with any material control or ownership of the fund. However, for a closely-held fund with a small number of investors, each having a large shareholding or other interest, the Regulator would expect a Relevant Person to identify and verify each of the Beneficial Owners, depending on the risks identified as part of its risk-based assessment of the customer. For a corporate health policy with defined benefits, however, the Regulator would not expect a Relevant Person to identify the Beneficial Owners.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on verification of the identity of Beneficial Owners.3. An eKYC System may be used as part of the identification and verification of Beneficial Owners. When determining whether to use an eKYC System to assist in the CDD of a Beneficial Owner, a Relevant Person should establish if the eKYC System used allows it to comply fully with the relevant Rules in relation to CDD.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.1. Individuals who have, or have had, a high political profile, or hold, or have held, public office, may pose a higher money laundering risks to a Relevant Person as their position may make them prone to corruption. This risk also extends to members of their families and to known close associates. Being a PEP does not, in itself, of course, incriminate individuals or entities.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.2. Generally, a foreign PEP presents a higher risk of money laundering because there is a greater risk that such a Person, if he were undertaking money laundering, would attempt to place his money offshore, away from his home jurisdiction, where he is less likely to be recognised as a PEP and where it would be more difficult for law enforcement agencies in his home jurisdiction to confiscate or freeze his criminal proceeds.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.3. A Relevant Person should be aware that customer relationships with family members or close associates of PEPs involve similar risks to those with PEPs themselves.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.4. The risk of corruption-related money laundering increases where a Relevant Person deals with a PEP. Corruption may involve serious crimes and has become the subject of increasing global concern. Corruption offences are predicate crimes under Federal AML Legislation.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.5. The Regulator considers that after leaving office a PEP remains a higher risk for money laundering if such an individual continues to exert political influence or otherwise poses a risk of being involved in corruption.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.6. The fact that an individual is a PEP does not automatically mean that the individual must be assessed to be a high-risk customer: however, Enhanced CDD still needs to be undertaken on PEPs. A Relevant Person will need to assess the particular circumstances relating to each PEP to determine what risk category is appropriate.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on FATF Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring / Subject to a Call for Action\\n8.3.6.Guidance on FATF Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring / Subject to a Call for Action.1. A Relevant Person should maintain up-to-date lists of Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring and Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action and screen against them for potential exposure as part of CDD. Customer exposure to jurisdictions appearing on these lists should be taken into account when developing and applying risk-based measures relating to CDD. Customers exposed to such jurisdictions may present higher money laundering risks and specific counter-measures including Enhanced CDD may be required.\\n8.4 Enhanced Customer Due Diligence\\n8.4.1 Where a Relevant Person is required to undertake Enhanced CDD, having assigned a customer a high-risk rating or it or its Beneficial Owners is a PEP, then, in addition to CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.1, it must:\\n(a)\\tobtain:\\n(i)\\tadditional identification information on the customer and all Beneficial Owners;\\n(ii)\\tadditional information on the intended nature of the business relationship;\\n(iii)\\tinformation on the reasons for a Transaction;\\n(b)\\tupdate the CDD information which it holds on the customer and any Beneficial Owners more regularly;\\n(c)\\tidentify and verify:\\n(i)\\tthe Source of Funds; and\\n(ii)\\tthe Source of Wealth;\\nof the customer and, if applicable, all Beneficial Owners;\\n(d)\\tconduct enhanced monitoring of the business relationship, by increasing the frequency and intensity of controls applied, and determining which groups of transactions need further examination;\\n(e)\\tobtain the approval of Senior Management to commence a business relationship with the customer;\\n(f)\\trequire the first payment to be carried out through an account in the customer’s name with a financial institution that is subject to AML/TFS regulation and supervision in a jurisdiction that has standards equivalent to those set out in the FATF Recommendations; and\\n(g)\\tfor a customer who is a Natural Person, verify the current residential address (other than a post office box).\\n8.4.1.Guidance\\n8.4.1.Guidance.1. In Rule \\u200e8.4.1, Enhanced CDD measures are mandatory to the extent that they are applicable to the relevant customer or the circumstances of the business relationship and to the extent that the risks would reasonably require it. Therefore, the extent of additional measures to be conducted is a matter for the Relevant Person to determine on a case-by-case basis.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.2. In Rule \\u200e8.4.1(e), Senior Management approval may be given by an individual member of the Relevant Person\\'s Senior Management or by a committee of senior managers appointed to consider high-risk customers. Such approval may also be outsourced within the Group, but only to a suitably qualified individual or committee.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.3. For high-risk customers, a Relevant Person should, in order to mitigate the perceived potential and actual risks, exercise a greater degree of diligence throughout the course of the customer relationship and should endeavour to understand the nature of the customer\\'s business and consider whether it is consistent and reasonable.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.4. A Relevant Person should be satisfied that a customer\\'s use of complex legal structures and/or the use of trust and private investment vehicles, has a genuine and legitimate purpose.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.5. For Enhanced CDD, where there are one or more Beneficial Owners, verification of the customer\\'s Source of Funds and Wealth may require enquiring into the Beneficial Owners’ Source of Funds and Wealth because the Source of the Funds would normally be associated with the Beneficial Owners and not the customer.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.6. The Regulator considers that verification of Source of Funds includes obtaining independent corroborating evidence such as the proof of dividend payments connected to a shareholding, bank statements, salary/bonus certificates, loan documentation and proof of all Transactions which gave rise to payments into the account. A customer should be able to demonstrate and have documented how the relevant funds are connected to a particular event which gave rise to the payment into the account or to the source of the funds for a Transaction.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.7. The Regulator considers that verification of Source of Wealth includes obtaining independent corroborating evidence such as share certificates, publicly available registers of ownership, bank or brokerage account statements, probate documents, audited accounts and financial statements, news items from a reputable source and other similar evidence.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.8. A Relevant Person may commission a report from a third-party vendor to obtain further information on a customer or Transaction or to investigate a customer or Beneficial Owners in very high-risk cases. Such a report may be particularly useful where there is little or no publicly available information on a Person or on a Legal Arrangement or where the Relevant Person has difficulty in obtaining and verifying information.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.9. For Rule \\u200e8.4.1, circumstances where it may be applicable to require the first payment made by a customer in order to open an account with a Relevant Person to be carried out through a bank account in the customer\\'s name include:\\n(a)\\twhere, following the use of other Enhanced Customer Due Diligence measures, the Relevant Person is not satisfied with the results of that due diligence; or\\n(b)\\tas an alternative measure, where one of the measures in Rule \\u200e8.4.1(a) to (e) cannot be carried out.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.10. A Relevant Person should maintain up-to-date lists of Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring and Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action and take these lists into account in developing and applying risk-based measures relating to CDD including the development of compliance procedures.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.11. CDD should include screening for customer exposure to Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring and Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action. Customer exposure to such jurisdictions may present higher money laundering risks and specific risk-based countermeasures may be required. In the case of customer exposure to Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring, this may include undertaking Enhanced CDD. In the case of customer exposure to Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action, Enhanced CDD should always be undertaken.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.12. Pursuant to directives of the NAMLCFTC, Relevant Persons must exercise appropriate levels of due diligence on Transactions originating from, routed through or destined for Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action and any other financial or non-financial engagement involving an individual or entity from such jurisdictions.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.13. Relevant Persons should ensure they are aware of and comply with the requirements of the FIU relating to the filing of a High Risk Country Transaction Report or a High Risk Country Activity Report (as applicable) via goAML. Currently, these must be filed prior to conducting Transactions where the remitter or the beneficiary is an individual or entity associated with a Jurisdiction Subject to a Call for Action. Such Transactions may only be executed in line with guidance issued by the FIU.\\n8.5 Simplified Customer Due Diligence\\n8.5.1\\n8.5.1.(1) Where a Relevant Person is permitted to undertake Simplified CDD under Rule \\u200e8.1.1(4), modification of Rule \\u200e8.3.1 may include:\\n(a)\\tverifying the identity of the customer and any Beneficial Owners after the establishment of the business relationship;\\n(b)\\tdeciding to reduce the frequency of, or as appropriate not undertake, customer identification updates;\\n(c)\\tdeciding not to verify an identification document other than by requesting a copy;\\n(d)\\treducing the degree of ongoing monitoring of Transactions, based on a reasonable monetary threshold or on the nature of the Transaction; and\\n(e)\\tnot collecting specific information or carrying out specific measures to understand the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, but inferring such purpose and nature from the type of Transactions or business relationship established.\\n8.5.1.(2) The modification undertaken under (1) must be proportionate to the customer\\'s money laundering risks.\\n8.5.1.Guidance\\n8.5.1.Guidance.1. A Relevant Person should not use a \"one size fits all\" approach for all of its low-risk customers. Notwithstanding that the risks may be low for all such customers in that category, the extent of CDD undertaken needs to be proportionate to the specific risks identified on a case-by-case basis.\\n8.5.1.Guidance.2. A Relevant Person might reasonably reduce the frequency of or, as appropriate, eliminate customer identification updates where the money laundering risks are low and the service provided does not offer a realistic opportunity for money laundering.\\n8.5.1.Guidance.3. An example of where a Relevant Person might reasonably reduce the degree of ongoing monitoring and scrutinising of Transactions, based on a reasonable monetary threshold or on the nature of the Transaction, would be where the Transaction is a recurring, fixed contribution to a savings scheme, investment portfolio or fund or where the monetary value of the Transaction is not material for money laundering purposes given the nature of the customer and the Transaction type.\\n8.6 Ongoing Customer Due Diligence\\n8.6.1 When undertaking ongoing CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(d), a Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tmonitor Transactions undertaken during the course of its customer relationship to ensure that the Transactions are consistent with the Relevant Person\\'s knowledge of the customer, his business and risk rating;\\n(b)\\tpay particular attention to any complex or unusually large Transactions or unusual patterns of Transactions that have no apparent or visible economic or legitimate purpose;\\n(c)\\tenquire into the background and purpose of the Transactions in (b);\\n(d)\\tperiodically review the adequacy of the CDD information it holds on customers and Beneficial Owners to ensure that the information is kept up to date, particularly for customers with a high-risk rating; and\\n(e)\\tperiodically review each customer to ensure that the risk rating assigned to a customer under Rule \\u200e7.1.1(1)(b) remains appropriate for the customer in light of the money laundering risks.\\n8.6.2 A Relevant Person must apply an intensified and ongoing monitoring programme with respect to higher risk Transactions and customers.\\n8.6.2.Guidance\\n8.6.2.Guidance.1. The customer identification process does not end at the time of establishing a business relationship with a customer or, where relevant, undertaking a specific transaction or business activity on behalf of a customer. Following the start of the customer relationship, a Relevant Person should ensure that all relevant evidence and information is kept up to date including, for example, the list of authorised signatories who can act on behalf of a corporate customer.\\n8.6.2.Guidance.2. In complying with Rule 8.6.1(d), a Relevant Person should undertake a periodic review to ensure that non-static customer identity documentation is accurate and up to date.  A Relevant Person is expected to ensure that the information and the evidence obtained from a customer is valid and has not expired, for example when obtaining copies of identification documentation such as a passport or identification card.  Examples of non-static identity documentation include passport number and residential/business address and, for a Legal Person, its share register or list of partners.\\n8.6.2.Guidance.3. A Relevant Person should undertake a review under Rule \\u200e8.6.1(d) and (e) particularly when:\\n(a)\\tthe Relevant Person changes its CDD documentation requirements;\\n(b)\\tan unusual Transaction with the customer is expected to take place;\\n(c)\\tthere is a material change in the business relationship with the customer; or\\n(d)\\tthere is a material change in the nature or ownership of the customer.\\n8.6.2.Guidance.4. The degree of the ongoing due diligence to be undertaken will depend on the customer risk assessment carried out under Rule \\u200e7.1.1.\\n8.6.2.Guidance.5. A Relevant Person\\'s Transaction monitoring policies, procedures, systems and controls, which may be implemented by manual or automated systems, or a combination thereof, are one of the most important aspects of effective CDD. Whether a Relevant Person should undertake the monitoring by means of a manual or computerised system, or both, will depend on a number of factors, including:\\n(a)\\tthe size and nature of the Relevant Person\\'s business and customer base; and\\n(b)\\tthe complexity and volume of customer Transactions.\\n8.6.3 A Relevant Person must review its customers, their businesses, and Transactions, against Sanctions Lists when complying with Rule \\u200e8.6.1(d).\\n8.7 Failure to conduct or complete Customer Due Diligence\\n8.7.1\\n8.7.1.(1) Where, in relation to a customer, a Relevant Person is unable to conduct or complete the requisite CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.1.1 it must, where appropriate:\\n(a)\\tnot carry out a Transaction with or for the customer through a bank account or in cash;\\n(b)\\tnot open an account or otherwise provide a service;\\n(c)\\tnot otherwise establish a business relationship or carry out a Transaction;\\n(d)\\tterminate or suspend any existing business relationship with the customer;\\n(e)\\treturn any monies or assets received from the customer; and\\n(f)\\tconsider whether the inability to conduct or complete CDD necessitates the making of a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report under Rule \\u200e14.3.1(c).\\n8.7.1.(2) A Relevant Person is not obliged to comply with (1)(a) to (e) if:\\n(a)\\tto do so would amount to \"tipping off\" the customer, in breach of Federal AML Legislation; or\\n(b)\\tthe FIU directs the Relevant Person to act otherwise.\\n8.7.1.Guidance\\n8.7.1.Guidance.1. In complying with Rule \\u200e8.7.1(1) a Relevant Person should apply one or more of the measures in (a) to (f) as appropriate in the circumstances. Where CDD cannot be completed to a significant degree, it may be appropriate not to carry out a Transaction pending completion of CDD. Where CDD cannot be conducted, including where a material part of the CDD such as identifying and verifying Beneficial Owners cannot be undertaken, a Relevant Person should not establish a business relationship with the customer.\\n8.7.1.Guidance.2. A Relevant Person should note that Rule \\u200e8.7.1 applies to both existing and prospective customers. For prospective customers it may be appropriate for a Relevant Person to terminate the business relationship before a product or service is provided. However, for existing customers, while termination of the business relationship should not be ruled out, suspension may be more appropriate depending on the circumstances, whilst further investigations are carried out. Whichever course of action is taken, the Relevant Person should be careful not to tip off the customer.\\n8.7.1.Guidance.3. A Relevant Person should adopt the RBA in order to inform the appropriate level of CDD to be undertaken for existing customers. For example, if a Relevant Person considers that any of its existing customers (which may include customers that it migrates into the ADGM) have not been subject to CDD of a standard equivalent to that required by the AML Rulebook, it should adopt the RBA and take remedial action in a manner proportionate to the risks and within a reasonable period of time whilst complying with Rule \\u200e8.7.\\n8.8 Portability of Customer Due Diligence information\\n8.8.1\\n8.8.1.(1) A Relevant Person “A” that is an Authorised Person or a Recognised Body must provide another Relevant Person, “B”, that is an Authorised Person or a Recognised Body, at the request of B, with the Customer Due Diligence information for customers that has been collected by A under Rules \\u200e8.3 and \\u200e8.4, subject to:\\n(a)\\t\\tthose customers being customers of both A and B at the time that the request is made;\\n(b)\\tB obtaining the written consent of the customers to whom the request relates and providing A with that consent for the release of such information by A;\\n(c)\\t\\tthe request being made solely for the purposes of conducting Customer Due Diligence on the customers to whom the request relates; and\\n(d)\\tin the preceding twelve months B not having requested Customer Due Diligence information from A for the same customers to whom the request relates.\\n8.8.1.(2) Relevant Person A must also provide Relevant Person B with any other information relevant to CDD that has been provided to it by those customers.\\n8.8.2 Following a request made under Rule \\u200e8.8.1, A must transfer to B without undue delay all Customer Due Diligence information in its possession for those customers.\\n8.8.3 Relevant Person A must not charge B a fee for the provision of Customer Due Diligence information provided under Rule \\u200e8.8.1.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  '9. AML/TFS COMPLIANCE AND THIRD PARTIES\\n9.1 Reliance on a third party\\n9.1.1\\n9.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person may rely on the following third parties to conduct one or more of the elements of CDD on its behalf:\\n(a)\\tan Authorised Person or Recognised Body;\\n(b)\\ta law firm, notary, or other independent legal business, accounting firm, audit firm or insolvency practitioner or an equivalent Person in another jurisdiction;\\n(c)\\ta Financial Institution;\\n(d)\\ta member of the Relevant Person\\'s Group; or\\n(e)\\tother specialised utilities for the provision of outsourced AML/TFS services.\\n9.1.1.(2) In (1), a Relevant Person may rely on the information previously obtained by a third party which covers one or more elements of CDD.\\n9.1.1.(3) Where a Relevant Person seeks to rely on a Person in (1) it may only do so if and to the extent that:\\n(a)\\tit immediately obtains the necessary CDD information from the third party in (1);\\n(b)\\tit takes adequate steps to satisfy itself that certified copies of the documents used to undertake the relevant elements of CDD will be available from the third party on request without delay;\\n(c)\\tthe Person in (1)(b) to (d) is subject to regulation, including AML/TFS compliance requirements, by a Non-ADGM Financial Services Regulator or other competent authority in a country with AML/TFS regulations which are equivalent to the standards set out in the FATF Recommendations and it is supervised for compliance with such regulations;\\n(d)\\tthe Person in (1) has not relied on any exception from the requirement to conduct any relevant elements of CDD which the Relevant Person seeks to rely on; and\\n(e)\\tin relation to (2), the information is up to date.\\n9.1.1.(4) Where a Relevant Person relies on a member of its Group to conduct one or more of the elements of CDD on its behalf, such Group member need not meet the condition in (3)(c) if:\\n(a)\\tthe Group is subject to policies and requirements equivalent to FATF standards, either:\\n(i)\\twhere the Group applies and implements a Group-wide policy on CDD and record-keeping which is equivalent to the standards set by FATF; or\\n(ii)\\twhere the effective implementation of those CDD and record-keeping requirements and AML/TFS programmes are supervised at Group level by a Non-ADGM Financial Services Regulator or other competent authority in a jurisdiction with AML/TFS regulations that are equivalent to the standards set out in the FATF Recommendations;\\n(b)\\tno exception from identification obligations has been applied in the original identification process; and\\n(c)\\ta written statement is received from the introducing member of the Relevant Person\\'s Group confirming that:\\n(i)\\tthe customer has been identified in accordance with the relevant standards under (4)(a) and (b);\\n(ii)\\tany identification evidence can be accessed by the Relevant Person without delay; and\\n(iii)\\tthe identification evidence will be kept for at least six years.\\n9.1.1.(5) If a Relevant Person is not reasonably satisfied that a customer or Beneficial Owners has been identified and verified by a third party in a manner consistent with these Rules, the Relevant Person must immediately perform the CDD itself with respect to any deficiencies identified.\\n(6)\\tNotwithstanding the Relevant Person\\'s reliance on a Person in \\u200e9.1.1(1), the Relevant Person remains responsible for compliance with, and liable for any failure to meet the CDD requirements in the AML Rulebook.\\n9.1.2\\n9.1.2.(1) When assessing under Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3) or (4) if AML/TFS regulations in another jurisdiction are equivalent to FATF standards, a Relevant Person must take into account factors including, but not limited to:\\n(a)\\tmutual evaluations, assessment reports or follow-up reports published by FATF, the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD or other International Organisations;\\n(b)\\tmembership of FATF or other international or regional groups such as the MENAFATF or the Gulf Co-operation Council;\\n(c)\\tcontextual factors such as political stability or the level of corruption in the jurisdiction;\\n(d)\\tevidence of recent criticism of the jurisdiction, including in:\\n(i)\\tFATF advisory notices;\\n(ii)\\tpublic assessments of the jurisdiction’s AML/TFS regimes by organisations referred to in (a); or\\n(iii)\\treports by other relevant non-government organisations or specialist commercial organisations;\\n(e)\\twhether adequate arrangements exist for co-operation between the AML/TFS regulator in that jurisdiction and the Regulator.\\n9.1.2.(2) A Relevant Person making an assessment under (1) must rely only on sources of information that are reliable and up to date.\\n9.1.2.(3) A Relevant Person must keep adequate records of how it made its assessment, including the sources and materials considered.\\n9.1.2.Guidance\\n9.1.2.Guidance.1. In complying with Rule \\u200e\\u200e9.1.1(3)(a), \"immediately obtaining the necessary CDD information\" means obtaining all relevant CDD information, and not just basic information such as name and address. However, compliance can be achieved by having the information sent in an email or other appropriate means. For the avoidance of doubt, it does not necessarily require a Relevant Person to immediately obtain the underlying certified documents used by the third party to undertake its CDD because under Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3)(b), these need only be available on request without delay.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.2. The Regulator would expect a Relevant Person, in complying with Rule \\u200e\\u200e9.1.1(5), to fill any gaps in the CDD process as soon as it becomes aware that a customer or Beneficial Owners has not been identified and verified by the third party in a manner consistent with these Rules.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.3. If a Relevant Person acquires another business, either in whole or in substantial part, the Regulator would permit the Relevant Person to rely on the CDD conducted by the business it is acquiring, but would expect the Relevant Person to have done the following:\\n(a)\\tas part of its due diligence for the acquisition, to have taken a reasonable sample of the prospective customers to assess the quality of the CDD undertaken; and\\n(b)\\tto have undertaken CDD on all the customers to cover any deficiencies identified in (a) as soon as possible following the acquisition, prioritising high-risk customers.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.4. Where the legislative framework of a jurisdiction (such as secrecy or data protection legislation) prevents a Relevant Person from having access to CDD information upon request without delay as referred to in Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3)(b), the Relevant Person should undertake the relevant CDD itself and should not seek to rely on the relevant third party.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.5. If a Relevant Person relies on a third party located in a foreign jurisdiction to conduct one or more elements of CDD on its behalf, the Relevant Person must ensure that the foreign jurisdiction has AML/TFS regulations which are equivalent to the standards in the FATF Recommendations (see Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3)(c)).\\n9.1.2.Guidance.6. Relevant Persons should follow directives issued by the NAMLCFTC. For example, Relevant Persons are prohibited from using third parties located in Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action to perform CDD.\\n9.2 Business partner identification\\n9.2.1\\n9.2.1.(1) Prior to establishing the business relationship, a Relevant Person must establish and verify the identity of its business partners by obtaining sufficient and satisfactory evidence of the identity of any business partner it relies upon in carrying on its Regulated Activities.\\n(a)\\tA Relevant Person must maintain accurate and up-to-date information and conduct ongoing due diligence on its business partners, throughout the course of the business relationship.\\n(b)\\tIf at any time a Relevant Person becomes aware that it lacks sufficient information or documentation concerning a business partner\\'s identification, or develops a concern about the accuracy of its current information or documentation, it must promptly obtain appropriate material to verify such business partner\\'s identity.\\n9.2.1.(2) In the context of this Rule, a \\'business partner\\' includes:\\n(a)\\ta third party as specified in Rule \\u200e9.1.1(1);\\n(b)\\ta member of the Relevant Person\\'s Group;\\n(c)\\ta Correspondent Bank; or\\n(d)\\tany other service provider.\\n9.2.1.(3) A Relevant Person that establishes, operates or maintains a Correspondent Account for a Correspondent Banking Client must ensure that it has arrangements to:\\n(a)\\tconduct due diligence in respect of the opening of a Correspondent Account for a Correspondent Banking Client, including measures to identify:\\n(i)\\tits ownership and management structure;\\n(ii)\\tits major business activities and customer base;\\n(iii)\\tits location; and\\n(iv)\\tthe intended purpose of the Correspondent Account;\\n(b)\\tidentify all third parties that will use the Correspondent Account; and\\n(c)\\tmonitor Transactions processed through a Correspondent Account that has been opened by a Correspondent Banking Client, in order to detect and report any suspicion of money laundering.\\n9.2.1.Guidance \\nUnder (2)(d), service providers include agents that directly facilitate the activities of Authorised Persons in servicing their clients, as distinct from other service providers that provide purely ancillary services, such as IT, facilities management etc. to an Authorised Person.\\n9.2.2 A Relevant Person must not:\\n9.2.2.(1) establish a correspondent banking relationship with a Shell Bank;\\n9.2.2.(2) establish or keep anonymous accounts or accounts in false names; or\\n9.2.2.(3) maintain a nominee account which is held in the name of one Person, but controlled by or held for the benefit of another Person whose identity has not been disclosed to the Relevant Person.\\n9.2.2.Guidance\\n9.2.2.Guidance.1. \"Know your business partner\" is as important as \"Know Your Customer\". A Relevant Person is therefore required to verify the identity of a prospective business partner and to obtain evidence of it. The same documentation that is used to identify customers should be obtained from the business partner prior to conducting any business.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.2. A Relevant Person should verify whether any secrecy or data protection law exists in the country of incorporation of the business partner that would prevent access to relevant data.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.3. The requirement to identify the business partner is meant to cover only those business partners who may pose any relevant money laundering risks to the Relevant Person. Hence, a Relevant Person would not be required to establish and verify the identity of, for example, its maintenance or cleaning service.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.4. The Regulator may take into account the identity of a Relevant Person\\'s business partner and the nature of their relationship in considering the fitness and propriety of a Relevant Person.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.5. Before entering into a business relationship, a Relevant Person should conduct a due diligence investigation, which includes ensuring that the business partner is an existing Person authorised to conduct the kind of business in question and, if applicable, verifying that this Person is duly regulated by a Financial Services Regulator or other relevant regulatory authority or regulator. In accordance with \"The Wolfsberg Anti-Money Laundering Principles for Correspondent Banking\", the Relevant Person should take into account, and verify the nature of:\\n(a)\\tthe business to be conducted and the major business activities of the business partner;\\n(b)\\tthe jurisdiction where the business partner is located as well as that of its parent; and\\n(c)\\tthe transparency and the nature of the ownership and the management structure.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.6. A Relevant Person may also gather information about the reputation of the business partner, including whether it has been subject to investigation or regulatory action in relation to money laundering.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.7. A Relevant Person should adopt a risk-based approach when verifying its business partners\\' identities. Depending on the money laundering risks assessment of the Relevant Person\\'s business partner, the Relevant Person should decide the level of detail of the business partner identification and verification process.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.8. A Relevant Person should have in place specific arrangements to ensure that adequate due diligence and identification measures with regard to the business relationship are taken.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.9. The Relevant Person should conduct regular reviews of the relationship with its business partners.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.10. The Senior Management or Governing Body of a Relevant Person should give its approval before it establishes any new correspondent banking relationships.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.11. A Relevant Person should also have arrangements to guard against establishing a business relationship with business partners who permit their accounts to be used by Shell Banks; further details on the definition of Shell Banks are set out in Guidance 2 to Rule \\u200e10.2.2.\\n9.3 Outsourcing and agents\\n9.3.1 A Relevant Person which outsources any one or more elements of its CDD to a service provider (including those within its Group) remains responsible for compliance with, and liable for any failure to meet, such obligations.\\n9.3.1A Prior to appointing a service provider to undertake CDD, a Relevant Person must undertake an initial assurance assessment to evaluate the suitability of the service provider and must ensure that the service provider\\'s obligations are clearly documented in a binding agreement.\\n9.3.1B After engaging a service provider the Relevant Person must undertake periodic assurance assessments to ensure that the services provided meet the obligations recorded in the binding agreement and allow it to meet all the requirements that it is subject to.\\n\\n9.3.1B.Guidance\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.1. The use by a Relevant Person of a service provider’s eKYC System that enables a Relevant Person to undertake eKYC constitutes outsourcing for the purposes of Rule \\u200e9.3.1.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.2. When undertaking an assurance assessment of an eKYC System for the purpose of Rule \\u200e9.3.1A, a Relevant Person should seek to establish that the eKYC System is reliable and independent, and allows the Relevant Person to comply with all applicable Rules of the Regulator. In addition, a Relevant Person should consider applying guidance on assurance standards issued by the Regulator, competent U.A.E. authorities, FATF, and other relevant standard setting bodies.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.3. In limited circumstances, a Relevant Person may place reliance on the assurance assessment of the eKYC System conducted entirely by another entity. Such circumstances comprise the following.\\n(a)\\tWhere an assurance assessment of the eKYC System has been undertaken by a Related entity and specifically addresses the Rules and Regulations applicable to the Relevant Person. In such circumstances, the Relevant Person remains responsible for the eKYC System’s compliance with applicable Rules and Laws and it should maintain a copy of the assessment.\\n(b)\\tWhere the eKYC System has been authorised by a competent authority of the U.A.E. or a competent authority in a jurisdiction with AML/TFS laws equivalent to the U.A.E. In such circumstances, the eKYC system should be authorised for use in CDD. Further, the Relevant Person should undertake its own review to ensure that any use of the relevant eKYC System is appropriate and enables compliance with all Rules and Regulations applicable to the Relevant Person.\\n(c)\\tWhere a Relevant Person chooses to employ a third party to assist in its own assurance assessment of the eKYC System, it should ensure that a competent and independent firm with relevant expertise and resources be employed. The Relevant Person remains wholly responsible for the eKYC System’s compliance with, and any failure to meet, the Rules and Regulations applicable to the Relevant Person.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.4. In complying with Rule \\u200e9.3.1, a Relevant Person should ensure that the service provider can be replaced with minimal disruption in the event the outsourcing arrangement is terminated.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.5. An Authorised Person is also required to comply with the outsourcing obligations in GEN 3.3.31 and 3.3.32 and PRU 6.8. A Recognised Body is also required to comply with the outsourcing obligations in MIR 2.14.\\n9.3.2 Authorised Persons Providing Money Services\\n9.3.2.(1) An Authorised Person that is engaged in Providing Money Services must:\\n(b)\\tmaintain a complete, current and accurate register of all agents and members of its Group it uses to conduct its operations and make that register available to the Regulator upon request;\\n(c)\\tinclude all agents and members of its Group identified in (a) as part of its AML/TFS compliance programme and monitor the compliance of such agents and members of its Group with the requirements of its AML/TFS programme;\\n(d)\\tcomply with all AML/TFS requirements imposed in all jurisdictions within which it operates and ensure the compliance of its agents and members of its Group operating on its behalf with all AML/TFS requirements in the jurisdictions in which they are operating;\\n(e)\\twhen executing a Payment Transaction, assess and consider all relevant information, including information about the Payer and the Payee, including any beneficiary as may be applicable, and require its agents and members of its Group, as appropriate, to determine whether a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report should be filed by it or its agents or a member of its Group; and\\n(f)\\twhere appropriate, ensure that the relevant equivalent of a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report is filed in all other jurisdictions related to a suspicious Payment Transaction and make available to all authorities responsible for AML/TFS compliance all transaction information related to the suspicious transaction.\\n9.3.2.(2) An Authorised Person making an assessment under (1) must rely upon current sources of information when making such assessment and must keep adequate records concerning such assessments, including all sources and materials considered, for a period of at least six years.\\n9.3.2.Guidance \\nAgents directly facilitate the activities of Authorised Persons in servicing their clients, as distinct from other service providers that provide purely ancillary services, such as IT, facilities management etc. to an Authorised Person.\\n\\n',\n",

CORRESPONDENT BANKING, WIRE TRANSFERS, ANONYMOUS ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT\\n10.1 Application\\n10.1.1 This Chapter applies to Recognised Bodies and all Authorised Persons, other than Credit Rating Agencies and Representative Offices.\\n10.2 Correspondent banking\\n10.2.1 An Authorised Person proposing to have a correspondent banking relationship with a respondent bank must:\\n(a)\\tundertake CDD on the respondent bank;\\n(b)\\tas part of (a), gather sufficient information about the respondent bank to understand fully the nature of the business, including making appropriate enquiries as to its management, its major business activities and the countries or jurisdictions in which it operates;\\n(c)\\tdetermine from publicly available information the reputation of the respondent bank and the quality of supervision that is subject to, including whether it has been the subject of a money laundering investigation or relevant regulatory action;\\n(d)\\tassess the respondent bank\\'s AML/TFS controls and ascertain if they are adequate and effective in light of the FATF Recommendations;\\n(e)\\tensure that prior approval of the Authorised Person\\'s Senior Management is obtained before entering into a new correspondent banking relationship;\\n(f)\\tensure that the respective responsibilities of the parties to the correspondent banking relationship are properly documented;\\n(g)\\tbe satisfied that, in respect of any customers of the respondent bank who have direct access to accounts of the Authorised Person, the respondent bank:\\n(i)\\thas undertaken CDD (including ongoing CDD) at least equivalent to that in Rule \\u200e8.3.1 in respect of each customer; and\\n(ii)\\tis able to provide the relevant CDD information in (i) to the Authorised Person upon request; and\\n(h)\\tdocument the basis for its satisfaction that the requirements in (a) to (g) are met.\\n10.2.2 An Authorised Person must:\\n(a)\\tnot enter into a correspondent banking relationship with a Shell Bank; and\\n(b)\\ttake appropriate measures to ensure that it does not enter into, or continue a corresponding banking relationship with, a bank which is known to permit its accounts to be used by Shell Banks.\\n10.2.2.Guidance\\n10.2.2.Guidance.1. The rules and guidance set out in Rule \\u200e9.2 above also apply to correspondent banking business partners. This Rule provides further details on specific requirements applicable to a correspondent banking business relationship.\\n10.2.2.Guidance.2. With regard to Correspondent Banking Clients and, if applicable, other qualified professionals, specific care should be taken to assess their AML/TFS arrangements regarding customer identification, Transaction monitoring, terrorist financing and other relevant elements, and to verify that these business partners comply with the same or equivalent AML/TFS requirements as the Relevant Person. Information on applicable laws and regulations regarding the prevention of money laundering should be obtained.\\n10.2.2.Guidance.3. A Relevant Person should ensure that a Correspondent Banking Client does not use the Relevant Person\\'s products and services to engage in business with Shell Banks. A Shell Bank would be a bank that has no physical presence in the country in which it is incorporated and licensed, and which is unaffiliated with a regulated financial Group that is subject to effective consolidated supervision. The Regulator does not consider that the existence of a local agent or low-level staff constitutes physical presence.\\n10.2.2.Guidance.4. If applicable, information on distribution networks and delegation of duties should be obtained.\\n10.3 Wire transfers and the Travel Rule\\n10.3.1 In this section:\\n(a)\\t“account” includes a digital wallet when the wire transfer is a transfer of Virtual Assets;\\n(b)\\t“account holder” includes a wallet holder when the wire transfer is a transfer of Virtual Assets;\\n(c)\\t“account number” includes a wallet address when the wire transfer is a transfer of Virtual Assets;\\n(d)\\t“batch transfer” means a transfer comprised of a number of individual wire transfers that are bundled for transmission, whether or not the individual wire transfers are intended ultimately for one or more beneficiaries;\\n(e)\\t\"beneficiary\" means the Natural or Legal Person or the Legal Arrangement that is identified by the originator as the receiver of the requested wire transfer;\\n(f)\\t\"originator\" means the account holder who instructs the wire transfer from the relevant account, or where there is no account, the Natural or Legal Person that places the order with the ordering Financial Institution to perform the wire transfer; and\\n(g)\\t\"wire transfer\" includes any value transfer arrangement.\\n10.3.2\\n10.3.2.(1) An Authorised Person and Recognised Body must:\\n(a)\\twhen it sends or receives a wire transfer on behalf of a customer, ensure that the wire transfer and any related messages contain accurate originator and beneficiary information;\\n(b)\\tensure that, while the wire transfer is under its control, the information in (a) remains with the wire transfer and any related message throughout the payment chain;\\n(c)\\tmonitor wire transfers for the purpose of detecting those wire transfers that do not contain both originator and beneficiary information and take appropriate measures to identify any money laundering risks; and\\n(d)\\tnot effect wire transfers without the information required under (3) and (4).\\n10.3.2.(2) The requirement in (1) does not apply to an Authorised Person or Recognised Body which:\\n(a)\\tprovides Financial Institutions with messages or other support systems for wire transfers; or\\n(b)\\tundertakes a wire transfer to another Financial Institution where both the originator and the beneficiary are Financial Institutions acting on their own behalf.\\n10.3.2.(3) An Authorised Person and Recognised Body must ensure that information accompanying all wire transfers contains at a minimum:\\n(a)\\tthe name of the originator;\\n(b)\\tthe originator account number where such an account is used to process the Transaction or a unique Transaction reference number if no originator account number exists;\\n(c)\\tthe originator\\'s address, or national identity number, or travel document number, or customer identification number, or date and place of birth;\\n(d)\\tthe name of the beneficiary; and\\n(e)\\tthe beneficiary account number where such an account is used to process the Transaction or a unique Transaction reference number if no beneficiary account number exists.\\n10.3.2.(4) An Authorised Person and Recognised Body must ensure that for batch transfers:\\n(a)\\tit has verified the originator information required under (3)(a) to (c); and\\n(b)\\tthe batch file contains the beneficiary information required under (3)(d) and (e) for each beneficiary and that the information is fully traceable in the beneficiaries jurisdiction.\\n10.3.2.Guidance\\n10.3.2.Guidance.1. \\'FATF Recommendation Number 16\\' seeks to ensure that national or international electronic payment and message systems, including fund or wire transfer systems such as SWIFT, are not misused as a means to break the money laundering audit trail. Therefore, the information about a customer as the originator of the wire transfer should remain with the payment instruction throughout the payment chain.\\n10.3.2.Guidance.2. Relevant Persons should monitor for, and conduct enhanced scrutiny of, suspicious activities, including incoming wire transfers that do not contain complete originator information, including name, address and account number or unique reference number.\\n10.3.2.Guidance.3. The Regulator considers that concealing or removing in a wire transfer any of the information required by Rule \\u200e10.3.2(3) would be a breach of the requirement to ensure that the wire transfer contains accurate originator and beneficiary information.\\n10.3.2.Guidance.4. The Regulator expects compliance by Authorised Persons and Recognised Bodies with ‘FATF Recommendation Number 15’, FATF’s Interpretative Note (R.15/INR.15) and ‘FATF Recommendation Number 16’ that include requirements to obtain, hold, and transmit originator and beneficiary information and to not allow transfers where such information is lacking including where the value transfer involves Virtual Assets. Authorised Persons and Recognised Bodies should note that, pursuant to section \\u200e10.3, the Regulator does not differentiate between the responsibilities of the originator or the beneficiary when it comes to ensuring that all relevant information accompanies a wire transfer, and that no de minimis threshold is applied to the size of a relevant wire transfer.\\n10.4 Audit\\n10.4.1 An Authorised Person or a Recognised Body must ensure that its internal audit function undertakes regular reviews and assessments of the effectiveness of the Authorised Person or Recognised Body\\'s money laundering policies, procedures, systems and controls, and its compliance with its obligations in the AML Rulebook.\\n10.4.1.Guidance\\n10.4.1.Guidance.1. The review and assessment undertaken for the purposes of Rule \\u200e10.4.1 may be undertaken:\\n(a)\\tinternally by the Authorised Person or Recognised Body\\'s internal audit function; or\\n(b)\\tby a competent firm of independent, external auditors or compliance professionals.\\n10.4.1.Guidance.2. The review and assessment undertaken for the purposes of Rule \\u200e10.4.1 should cover at least the following:\\n(a)\\tsample testing of compliance with the Authorised Person or the Recognised Body\\'s CDD arrangements;\\n(b)\\tan analysis of all notifications made to the MLRO to highlight any area where procedures or training may need to be enhanced; and\\n(c)\\ta review of the nature and frequency of the dialogue between Senior Management and the MLRO.\\n10.5 Anonymous and nominee accounts\\n10.5.1 An Authorised Person or a Recognised Body must not establish or maintain:\\n(a)\\tan anonymous account or an account in a fictitious name; or\\n(b)\\ta nominee account which is held in the name of one Person, but which is controlled by or held for the benefit of another Person whose identity has not been disclosed to the Authorised Person or the Recognised Body.\\n',\n",
       "  '11. TARGETED FINANCIAL SANCTIONS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS\\n11.1 Resolutions and Sanctions\\n11.1.1\\n11.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person must establish and maintain effective systems and controls to ensure that on an ongoing basis it is properly informed as to, and takes reasonable measures to comply with, relevant resolutions or Sanctions which it is required to comply with, under the laws of the ADGM or any other jurisdiction.\\n11.1.1.(2) A Relevant Person must immediately notify the Regulator when it becomes aware that it is, for or on behalf of a Person:\\n(a)\\tcarrying on or about to carry on an activity;\\n(b)\\tholding or about to hold money or other assets; or\\n(c)\\tundertaking or about to undertake any other business whether or not arising from or in connection with (a) or (b);\\nwhere such carrying on, holding or undertaking constitutes or may constitute a contravention of any Sanctions with which the Relevant Person is required to comply, under the laws of the ADGM or any other jurisdiction.\\n11.1.1.(3) A Relevant Person must ensure that the notification stipulated in (2) above includes the following information:\\n(a)\\ta description of the relevant activity in (2)(a), (b) or (c); and\\n(b)\\tthe action proposed to be taken or that has been taken by the Relevant Person with regard to the matters specified in the notification.\\n11.1.1.Guidance\\n11.1.1.Guidance.1. In Rule \\u200e11.1.1(1), taking reasonable measures to comply with resolutions or Sanctions may include, for example, a Relevant Person not undertaking a transaction for or on behalf of a Person without undertaking further due diligence in respect of that Person.\\n11.1.1.Guidance.2. Relevant resolutions or Sanctions mentioned in Rule \\u200e11.1.1 may, among other things, relate to money laundering, terrorist financing or the financing of WMD, or otherwise be relevant to the activities carried on by the Relevant Person. For example:\\n(a)\\ta Relevant Person should exercise due care to ensure that it does not provide services to, or otherwise conduct business with, a Person engaged in money laundering, terrorist financing or the financing of WMD; and\\n(b)\\ta Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House, as a Recognised Body, should additionally exercise due care to ensure that it does not facilitate fund raising activities or listings by Persons engaged in money laundering or terrorist financing or financing of WMD.\\n11.1.1.Guidance.3. A Relevant Person should be proactive in checking for, and taking measures to comply with, relevant resolutions or Sanctions which the Relevant Person is required to comply with, under the laws of the ADGM or any other jurisdiction. This should include measures that enable a Relevant Person to comply with their obligations under Federal AML Legislation. The Regulator expects Relevant Persons to perform checks on an ongoing basis against their customer databases and records for any names appearing in resolutions or Sanctions which the Relevant Person is required to comply with as well as to monitor transactions accordingly.\\n11.1.1.Guidance.4. A Relevant Person may use a database maintained elsewhere for an up-to-date list of resolutions and Sanctions, or to perform checks of customers or transactions against that list. For example, it may wish to use a database maintained by its head office or a Group member. However, the Relevant Person retains responsibility for ensuring that its systems and controls are effective to ensure compliance with this Rulebook.\\n11.1.1.Guidance.5. The systems and controls referred to in Rule \\u200e11.1.1(1) should enable a Relevant Person to comply with the requirements of Article 21 of Cabinet Decision No. (74) of 2020, which include:\\n(a)\\tRegistering on the EOCN website to receive updates on changes to Targeted Financial Sanctions lists.\\n(b)\\tRegularly screening its databases and transactions against Targeted Financial Sanctions lists as required by the screening scope and timings as set out in the Cabinet Decision.\\n(c)\\tImplementing freezing measures without delay or prior notice to the relevant Person(s) if a match is found as a result of the required screening.\\n(d)\\tLifting freezing measures without delay, where necessary.\\n(e)\\tNotifying appropriate regulatory authorities of any of the scenarios set out in the Cabinet Decision including confirmed or partial matches against Targeted Financial Sanctions lists.\\n(f)\\tEstablishing and implementing internal controls and procedures to ensure compliance with the Cabinet Decision.\\n(g)\\tCo-operating with the EOCN and relevant regulatory authorities.\\n11.1.1.Guidance.6. Relevant Persons should ensure they are fully aware of and in compliance with the requirements issued pursuant to Federal AML Legislation by the EOCN and other relevant authorities including the requirement to file PNMRs and FFRs as appropriate. Failure to do so, including failure to file a report relating to a confirmed or partial match with a Targeted Financial Sanctions list, may result in the Regulator taking appropriate action.\\n11.2 Government, regulatory and international findings\\n11.2.1\\n11.2.1.(1) A Relevant Person must establish and maintain systems and controls to ensure that on an ongoing basis it is properly informed as to, and takes reasonable measures to comply with, any findings, recommendations, guidance, directives, resolutions, Sanctions, notices or other conclusions issued by:\\n(a)\\tthe government of the U.A.E. or any government departments in the U.A.E.;\\n(b)\\tthe Central Bank of the U.A.E.;\\n(c)\\tthe FIU;\\n(d)\\tthe EOCN;\\n(e)\\tthe NAMLCFTC;\\n(f)\\tU.A.E. enforcement agencies;\\n(g)\\tthe UNSC;\\n(h)\\tFATF;\\n(i)\\tthe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision;\\n(j)\\tthe Regulator; and\\n(k)\\tany other jurisdiction which promulgates Sanctions to which it is subject,\\nconcerning the matters in (2).\\n11.2.1.(2) For the purposes of (1), the relevant matters are:\\n(a)\\tarrangements for preventing money laundering, terrorist financing or the financing of weapons of mass destruction in a particular country or jurisdiction, including any assessment of material deficiency in adopting international standards against a relevant country or jurisdiction; and\\n(b)\\tthe names of Persons, groups, organisations or entities or any other body where suspicion of money laundering exists.\\n11.2.1.(3) For the purposes of (1), measures that a Relevant Person must undertake when taking reasonable measures to comply with findings, recommendations, guidance, directives, resolutions, Sanctions, notices or other conclusions, include, but are not limited to, countermeasures:\\n(a)\\trequiring specific elements of enhanced CDD;\\n(b)\\trequiring enhanced reporting mechanisms or systematic reporting of financial transactions;\\n(c)\\tlimiting business relationships or financial transactions with specified persons or persons in a specified jurisdiction;\\n(d)\\tprohibiting Relevant Persons from relying on third parties located in a specified jurisdiction to conduct CDD;\\n(e)\\trequiring the review and amendment, or if necessary termination, of correspondent relationships with banks in a specified jurisdiction;\\n(f)\\tprohibiting the execution of specified electronic fund transfers; or\\n(g)\\trequiring increased external audit requirements for financial groups with respect to any of their branches and subsidiaries located in a specified jurisdiction.\\n11.2.1.(4) The systems and controls referred to in (1) must enable the Relevant Person to comply with the requirements of Article 21 of Cabinet Decision No. (74) of 2020.\\n11.2.1.(5) A Relevant Person must immediately notify the Regulator in writing if it becomes aware of non-compliance by a Person with a finding, recommendation, guidance, directive, resolution, Sanction, notice or other conclusion and provide the Regulator with sufficient details of the Person concerned and the nature of the non-compliance.\\n11.2.1.Guidance\\n11.2.1.Guidance.1. The purpose of this Rule is to ensure that a Relevant Person takes into consideration the broad range of tools used by competent authorities and international organisations to communicate AML/TFS risks to stakeholders.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.2. The Regulator may require enhanced CDD or other specific countermeasures to address risks identified in a specific country or jurisdiction. The Regulator may impose such countermeasures either when called upon to do so by FATF or independently of any FATF request.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.3. Relevant Persons considering Transactions or business relationships with Persons located in countries or jurisdictions that have been identified as deficient, or against which the U.A.E. or the Regulator have outstanding advisories, should be aware of the background against which the assessments or the specific recommendations have been made. These circumstances should be taken into account in respect of business introduced from such jurisdictions, and when receiving inward payments for existing customers or in respect of inter-bank transactions. The NAMLCFTC website provides information concerning national AML/TFS initiatives, including countermeasures for high-risk countries and updates on developments for high-risk countries.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.4. The Relevant Person\\'s MLRO is not obliged to report all Transactions from these countries or jurisdictions to the FIU if they do not qualify as suspicious under Federal AML Legislation (see Chapter \\u200e14 on Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports) unless otherwise instructed to do so by the NAMLCFTC.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.5. Transactions with counterparties located in countries or jurisdictions which are no longer identified as deficient or have been relieved from special scrutiny (for example, taken off sources mentioned in this Guidance) may nevertheless require attention which is higher than normal.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.6. In order to assist Relevant Persons, the Regulator may publish findings, guidance, directives or Sanctions from U.A.E. authorities, the FATF or other relevant bodies. However, the Regulator expects a Relevant Person to take its own steps in acquiring relevant information from various available sources. For example, a Relevant Person may obtain relevant information from consolidated lists of financial Sanctions published by the European Union, HM Treasury, and OFAC.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.7. In addition, the systems and controls mentioned in Rule \\u200e11.2.1 should be established and maintained by a Relevant Person taking into account its risk assessment under Chapters \\u200e6 and \\u200e7. In relation to the term \"make appropriate use\" in Rule \\u200e11.2.1, this may mean that a Relevant Person cannot undertake a Transaction for or on behalf of a Person or that it may need to undertake further due diligence in respect of such a Person.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.8. A Relevant Person should be proactive in obtaining and appropriately using available national and international information, for example, suspect lists or databases from credible public or private sources with regard to money laundering, including obtaining relevant information from sources mentioned in Guidance 6 above. The Regulator encourages Relevant Persons to perform checks against their customer databases and records for any names appearing on such lists and databases as well as to monitor Transactions accordingly.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.9. The risk of terrorists entering the financial system can be reduced if Relevant Persons apply effective AML/TFS strategies, particularly with respect to CDD. Relevant Persons should assess which countries carry the highest risks and should conduct an analysis of Transactions from countries or jurisdictions known to be a source of terrorist financing.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.10. The Regulator may require Relevant Persons to take any special measures it may prescribe with respect to certain types of Transactions or accounts where the Regulator reasonably believes that any of the above may pose a money laundering risks to the ADGM.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.11. Relevant Persons are required to have arrangements in place to ensure the ability to comply with all applicable Sanctions in relation to physical delivery of commodities including Spot Commodities.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.12. Relevant Persons are reminded that the U.A.E. has regulations in place relating to controls on the export and import of dual-use goods. Relevant Persons should ensure they are in compliance with such regulations. The EOCN makes a list of dual-use goods that are subject to export and import controls available on its website.\\n\\n',\n",

MONEY LAUNDERING REPORTING OFFICER\\n12.1 Appointment of an MLRO\\n12.1.1\\n12.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person must appoint an individual as the MLRO who has an appropriate level of seniority, experience and independence to act in the role, with responsibility for implementation and oversight of its compliance with the Rules in the AML Rulebook. It must do so by completing and filing with the Regulator the appropriate form specified by the Regulator.\\n12.1.1.(2) The MLRO in (1) and Rule \\u200e12.1.7 must be resident in the U.A.E.\\n12.1.2 The individual appointed as the MLRO of a DNFBP that comprises of one officer, partner or principal can, with the prior approval of the Regulator be the same person as the officer, partner or principal of the DNFBP.\\n12.1.3 The individual appointed as the MLRO of a Representative Office must be the same individual who holds the position of Principal Representative of that Representative Office.\\n12.1.3.Guidance\\n12.1.3.Guidance.1. Authorised Persons are reminded that under GEN Rule 5.5.1 the MLRO function is a mandatory appointment. For the avoidance of doubt, the individual appointed as the MLRO of an Authorised Person, other than a Representative Office, is the same individual who holds the Controlled Function of MLRO of that Authorised Person. Authorised Persons are also reminded that the guidance under GEN Rule 5.5.2 sets out the grounds under which the Regulator will determine whether to grant a waiver from the residence requirements for an MLRO. The same guidance is relevant to other Relevant Persons seeking a waiver from the MLRO residence requirements.\\n12.1.3.Guidance.2. The individual appointed as the MLRO of a Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House is the same individual who holds the position of MLRO of that Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House under the relevant MIR Rule.\\n12.1.4 If the MLRO leaves the employment of the Relevant Person, the Relevant Person must immediately appoint a new MLRO or arrange temporary cover for the MLRO appointment.\\n12.1.5 A Relevant Person, other than a Representative Office, must appoint an individual to act as a deputy MLRO of the Relevant Person to fulfil the role of the MLRO in his absence.\\n12.1.6 A Relevant Person's MLRO and deputy MLRO must deal with the Regulator in an open and co-operative manner and must disclose appropriately any information of which the Regulator would reasonably be expected to be notified.\\n12.1.6.Guidance\\n12.1.6.Guidance.1. The individual appointed as the deputy MLRO need not apply for the Regulator’s approval.\\n12.1.6.Guidance.2. A Relevant Person should make adequate arrangements to ensure that it remains in compliance with the AML Rulebook in the event that its MLRO is absent. Adequate arrangements would include appointing a temporary MLRO for the period of the MLRO's absence or making sure that the Relevant Person's AML/TFS systems and controls allow it to continue to comply with these Rules when the MLRO is absent.\\n12.1.7 A Relevant Person may outsource the role of MLRO to an individual outside the Relevant Person provided that the individual under the outsourcing agreement is and remains suitable to perform the MLRO role.\\n12.1.7.Guidance \\nWhere a Relevant Person outsources specific AML/TFS tasks of its MLRO to another individual or a third-party provider, including the case where they are within its corporate Group, the Relevant Person remains responsible for ensuring that the duties undertaken by the MLRO ensure its compliance with the requirements in the AML Rulebook. The Relevant Person should satisfy itself of the suitability of anyone who acts for it in the role of MLRO.\\n12.2 Qualities of an MLRO\\n12.2.1 A Relevant Person must ensure that its MLRO has:\\n(a)\\tdirect access to the Governing Body and its Senior Management;\\n(b)\\tsufficient and up-to-date qualifications and experience to fulfil the role;\\n(c)\\tsufficient resources including, if necessary, an appropriate number of appropriately trained Employees to assist in the performance of his duties in an effective, objective and independent manner;\\n(d)\\ta level of seniority and independence within the Relevant Person to enable him to act on his own authority;\\n(e)\\ttimely and unrestricted access to information the Relevant Person has about the financial and business circumstances of a customer or any Person on whose behalf the customer is or has been acting sufficient to enable him to carry out his responsibilities in accordance with Rule \\u200e12.3.1; and\\n(f)\\tunrestricted access to relevant information about the features of the Transaction which the Relevant Person has entered into or may have contemplated entering into with or for the customer or a Person on whose behalf a customer is or has been acting.\\n12.2.1.Guidance \\nThe Regulator considers that a Relevant Person will need to consider this Rule most especially when appointing an outsourced MLRO. Any external MLRO that is appointed will need to have the actual or effective level of seniority that the role requires.\\n12.3 Responsibilities of an MLRO\\n12.3.1 A Relevant Person must ensure that its MLRO implements and has oversight of and is responsible for the following matters:\\n(a)\\tthe day-to-day operations for compliance by the Relevant Person with its AML/TFS policies, procedures, systems and controls;\\n(b)\\tacting as the point of contact to receive internal notifications of suspicious activity from the Relevant Person's Employees under Rule \\u200e14.2.2;\\n(c)\\ttaking appropriate action under Rule \\u200e14.3.1 following receipt of a notification from an Employee;\\n(d)\\tmaking, in accordance with Federal AML Legislation, Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports;\\n(e)\\tacting as the point of contact within the Relevant Person for competent U.A.E. authorities and the Regulator regarding money laundering issues;\\n(f)\\tresponding promptly to any request for information made by competent U.A.E. authorities or the Regulator;\\n(g)\\treceiving and acting upon any relevant findings, recommendations, guidance, directives, resolutions, Sanctions, notices or other conclusions described in Chapter \\u200e11; and\\n(h)\\testablishing and maintaining an appropriate money laundering training programme and adequate awareness arrangements under Chapter \\u200e13.\\n12.3.1.Guidance \\nDepending on the size, nature and complexity of the business and operations, Relevant Persons and MLROs should consider whether it is appropriate to screen prospective employees for money laundering risks prior to employment to ensure high standards when hiring.\\n12.4 Reporting\\n12.4.1 The MLRO must report semi-annually to the Governing Body or Senior Management of the Relevant Person on the following matters:\\n(a)\\tthe results of the review under Rule \\u200e4.1.1(4);\\n(b)\\tthe Relevant Person's compliance with Federal AML Legislation and the Regulations and Rules of the Regulator (including this AML Rulebook);\\n(c)\\trelevant findings, recommendations, guidance, directives, resolutions, Sanctions, notices or other conclusions and how the Relevant Person has taken them into account;\\n(d)\\tinternal notification(s) of suspicious activity to the MLRO made under Rule \\u200e14.2.2 by the Relevant Person's Employees, or its agents or members of its Group where acting on its behalf, and action taken in respect of those reports, including the grounds for all decisions;\\n(e)\\tSuspicious Activity/Transaction Reports made by the Relevant Person, or its agents or members of its Group where acting on its behalf,  and action taken in respect of those reports including the grounds for all decisions; and\\n(f)\\tother relevant matters related to AML/TFS as it concerns the Relevant Person's business.\\n12.4.2 A Relevant Person must ensure that its Governing Body or Senior Management promptly:\\n(a)\\tassess the report provided under Rule \\u200e12.4.1;\\n(b)\\ttake action, as required, subsequent to consideration of the findings of the report, in order to resolve any identified deficiencies; and\\n(c)\\tmake a record of their assessment pursuant to paragraph (a) and the action taken pursuant to paragraph (b).\\n12.4.3 The Relevant Person must provide to the Regulator a copy of:\\n(a)\\tthe report provided under Rule \\u200e12.4.1; and\\n(b)\\tthe record made under Rule \\u200e12.4.2(c).\\n\\n\",\n",

AML/TFS TRAINING AND AWARENESS\\n13.1 Training and awareness\\n13.1.1 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tprovide AML/TFS training to all relevant Employees at appropriate and regular intervals;\\n(b)\\tensure that its AML/TFS training enables its Employees to:\\n(i)\\tknow the identity, and understand the responsibilities, of the Relevant Person's MLRO and his deputy;\\n(ii)\\tunderstand the relevant legislation relating to money laundering including Federal AML Legislation;\\n(iii)\\tunderstand its policies, procedures, systems and controls related to money laundering and any changes to these;\\n(iv)\\trecognise and deal with Transactions, risks, trends, techniques and other activities which may be related to money laundering;\\n(v)\\tunderstand the types of activity that may constitute suspicious activity in the context of the business in which an Employee is engaged and that may warrant an internal notification of suspicious activity to the MLRO under Rule \\u200e14.2.2;\\n(vi)\\tunderstand its arrangements regarding the making of an internal notification to the MLRO of suspicious activity under Rule \\u200e14.2.2;\\n(vii)\\tbe aware of the prevailing techniques, methods and trends in money laundering relevant to the business of the Relevant Person;\\n(viii)\\tunderstand the roles and responsibilities of Employees in combatting money laundering; and\\n(ix)\\tunderstand the relevant findings, recommendations, guidance, directives, resolutions, Sanctions, notices or other conclusions described in Chapter \\u200e11;\\n(c)\\tensure that its AML/TFS training:\\n(i)\\tis appropriately tailored to the Relevant Person's activities, including its products, services, customers, distribution channels, business partners and the level and complexity of its Transactions; and\\n(ii)\\tindicates the different levels of money laundering risks and vulnerabilities associated with the matters in (i); and\\n(d)\\tensure that its AML/TFS training is up to date with money laundering trends and techniques.\\n13.2 Frequency\\n13.2.1 A Relevant Person must provide AML/TFS training for all Employees in accordance with Rule \\u200e13.1.1 at least annually.\\n13.3 Record-keeping\\n13.3.1 All relevant details of the Relevant Person's AML/TFS training must be recorded, including:\\n(a)\\tdates when the training was given;\\n(b)\\tthe nature of the training; and\\n(c)\\tthe names of the Employees who received the training.\\n13.3.2 These records must be kept for at least six years from the date on which the training was given.\\n13.3.2.Guidance\\n13.3.2.Guidance.1. The Regulator considers it appropriate that all new relevant Employees of a Relevant Person be given appropriate AML/TFS training as soon as reasonably practicable after commencing employment with the Relevant Person, and thereafter on a periodic basis.\\n13.3.2.Guidance.2. A relevant Employee would include a member of the Senior Management or operational staff, any Employee with customer contact or who handles or may handle customer monies or assets, and any other Employee who might otherwise encounter money laundering in the business.\\n13.3.2.Guidance.3. Relevant Persons should take an RBA to AML/TFS training. The Regulator considers that AML/TFS training should be provided by a Relevant Person to each of its relevant Employees at intervals appropriate to the role and responsibilities of the Employee. In the case of an Authorised Person the Regulator expects that training should be provided to each relevant Employee at least annually.\\n13.3.2.Guidance.4.

       "  '14. SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY/TRANSACTION REPORTS\\n14.1 Application and definitions\\nIn this Chapter \"money laundering\" and “terrorist financing\" means the criminal offences defined in Federal AML Legislation.\\n14.2 Internal reporting requirements\\n14.2.1 A Relevant Person must establish and maintain policies, procedures, systems and controls in order to monitor and detect suspicious activity or Transactions in relation to potential money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.2.2 A Relevant Person must have policies, procedures, systems and controls to ensure that whenever any Employee, acting in the ordinary course of his employment, either:\\n(a)\\tknows;\\n(b)\\tsuspects; or\\n(c)\\thas reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting,\\nthat a Person is engaged in or attempting money laundering or terrorist financing, that Employee promptly notifies the Relevant Person\\'s MLRO and provides the MLRO with all relevant details.\\n14.2.3 A Relevant Person must have policies and procedures to ensure that disciplinary action can be taken against any Employee who fails to make such a report.\\n14.2.3.Guidance\\n14.2.3.Guidance.1. Circumstances that might give rise to suspicion or reasonable grounds for suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing include:\\n(a)\\tTransactions which have no apparent purpose, which make no obvious economic sense, or which are designed or structured to avoid detection;\\n(b)\\tTransactions requested by a Person without reasonable explanation, which are out of the ordinary range of services normally requested or are outside the experience of a Relevant Person in relation to a particular customer;\\n(c)\\twhere the size or pattern of Transactions, without reasonable explanation, is out of line with any pattern that has previously emerged or may have been deliberately structured to avoid detection;\\n(d)\\ta customer\\'s refusal to provide the information requested without reasonable explanation;\\n(e)\\twhere a customer who has just entered into a business relationship uses the relationship for a single Transaction or for only a very short period of time;\\n(f)\\textensive use of offshore accounts, companies or structures in circumstances where the customer\\'s economic needs do not support such requirements;\\n(g)\\tunnecessary routing of funds through third-party accounts; or\\n(h)\\tunusual Transactions without an apparently profitable motive.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.2. CDD measures form the basis for recognising suspicious activity or Transactions. Sufficient guidance must therefore be given to the Relevant Person\\'s Employees to enable them to form a suspicion or to recognise when they have reasonable grounds to suspect that money laundering or terrorist financing is taking place. This should involve training that will enable relevant Employees to seek and assess the information that is required for them to judge whether a Person is involved in suspicious activity or Transactions related to money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.3. Where appropriate, a Relevant Person should also utilise the methods described in paragraph 1 above to detect a range of Financial Crimes, including fraud. Bearing in mind the evolving nature of Financial Crime and the methods used to further it, a Relevant Person should apply best practice when determining which behaviours would be considered suspicious and what measures are required to detect suspicious activity and Transactions. Such practices may include, but are not limited to, incorporating the analysis of customer behaviour metrics into the monitoring of suspicious activity and Transactions.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.4. The requirement for Employees to notify the Relevant Person\\'s MLRO should include situations when no business relationship was developed because the circumstances were suspicious.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.5. A Relevant Person may allow its Employees to consult with their line managers before sending a report to the MLRO. The Regulator would expect that such consultation does not prevent making a report whenever an Employee has stated that he has knowledge, suspicion or reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that a Person may be involved in money laundering. Whether or not an Employee consults with his line manager or other Employees, the responsibility remains with the Employee to decide for himself whether a notification to the MLRO should be made.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.6. An Employee, including the MLRO, who considers that a Person has engaged in or is engaging in activity or Transactions that he knows or suspects to be suspicious would not be expected to know the exact nature of the criminal offence or that the particular funds were definitely those arising from the crime of money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.7. Activity or Transactions that appear unusual are not necessarily suspicious. Even customers with a stable and predictable Transaction profile will have periodic Transactions that are unusual for them. Many customers will, for perfectly good reasons, have an erratic pattern of Transactions or account activity. So the unusual is, in the first instance, only a basis for further inquiry, which may in turn require judgement as to whether it is suspicious. A Transaction or activity may not be suspicious at the time, but if suspicions are raised later, an obligation to report it then arises.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.8. Effective CDD measures may provide the basis for recognising unusual and suspicious activity and Transactions. Refusal to provide documentation to support CDD or refusal to disclose a beneficial owner may be considered suspicious activity. Where there is a customer relationship, suspicious activity will often be one that is inconsistent with a customer\\'s known legitimate activity, or with the normal business activities for that type of account or customer. Therefore, the key to recognising \"suspicious activity\" is knowing enough about the customer and the customer\\'s normal expected activities to recognise when their activity is abnormal.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.9. A Relevant Person may consider implementing policies and procedures whereby disciplinary action is taken against an Employee who fails to notify the Relevant Person\\'s MLRO.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.10. Relevant Persons should comply with guidance issued by the EOCN with regard to identifying and reporting suspicious activity and Transactions relating to money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.\\n14.3 Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports\\n14.3.1 A Relevant Person must ensure that where the Relevant Person\\'s MLRO receives an internal notification of suspicious activity under Rule \\u200e14.2.2, the MLRO, without delay:\\n(a)\\tinvestigates and documents the circumstances in relation to which the notification made under Rule \\u200e14.2.2 was made;\\n(b)\\tdetermines whether in accordance with Federal AML Legislation a SAR/STR must be made and documents such determination; and\\n(c)\\tif required, make a SAR/STR as soon as practicable.\\n14.3.2 The MLRO must, following receipt of an internal notification of suspicious activity under Rule \\u200e14.2.2, document:\\n(a)\\tthe steps taken to investigate the circumstances in relation to which the internal notification is made; and\\n(b)\\twhere no external SAR/STR is made, the reasons why no such report was made.\\n14.3.3 Where, following a notification to the MLRO of suspicious activity under \\u200e14.2.2, no SAR/STR is made, a Relevant Person must record the reasons for not making a SAR/STR.\\n14.3.4 A Relevant Person must ensure that if the MLRO decides to make a SAR/STR, his decision is made independently and is not subject to the consent or approval of any other Person.\\n14.3.5 Relevant Persons are required to register on goAML upon receipt of their Financial Services Permission, Recognition Order or registration licence in order to submit SAR/STRs.\\n14.3.5.Guidance\\n14.3.5.Guidance.1. Relevant Persons are reminded that the failure to report suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing may constitute a criminal offence that is punishable under the laws of the U.A.E.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.2. Relevant Persons should comply with guidance issued by the EOCN regarding reporting suspicious activity and Transactions relating to money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.3. SARs/STRs under Federal AML Legislation should be submitted to the FIU via goAML. The dedicated mechanism for registering and reporting on goAML is available on the Regulator’s website. Failure to register on goAML may lead to the Regulator taking action.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.4. In the preparation of a SAR/STR, if a Relevant Person knows or assumes that the funds which form the subject of the report do not belong to a customer but to a third party, this fact and the details of the Relevant Person\\'s proposed course of further action in relation to the case should be included in the report.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.5. If a Relevant Person has filed a SAR/STR, the FIU may instruct the Relevant Person on how to continue its business relationship, including effecting any Transaction with a Person. If the customer in question expresses his wish to move the funds before the Relevant Person receives instruction from the FIU on how to proceed, the Relevant Person should immediately contact the FIU for further instructions.\\n14.4 Suspension of Transactions and “no tipping-off” requirement\\n14.4.1 A Relevant Person must not carry out Transactions that it knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting to be related to money laundering or terrorist financing until it has informed the FIU pursuant to Rule \\u200e14.3.1.\\n14.4.1.Guidance\\n14.4.1.Guidance.1. Relevant Persons are reminded that in accordance with Federal AML Legislation, Relevant Persons or any of their Employees must not tip off any Person, that is, inform any Person that he is being scrutinised, or investigated by any other competent authority, for possible involvement in suspicious Transactions or activity related to money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.4.1.Guidance.2. If a Relevant Person reasonably believes that performing CDD measures will tip off a customer or potential customer, it may choose not to pursue that process and should file a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report. Relevant Persons should ensure that their Employees are aware of and sensitive to these issues when considering the CDD measures.\\n14.5 Record-keeping\\n14.5.1 All relevant details of any notification to the MLRO under Rule \\u200e14.2 or Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports filed pursuant to Rule \\u200e14.3 must be kept for at least six years from the date on which the report was made.\\n14.6 Freezing of assets\\n14.6.Guidance \\nThe Regulator has certain powers under FSMR to impose a requirement restricting an Authorised Person or Recognised Body from disposing of or transferring property including, for example, assets or other funds suspected of relating to money laundering. It may also apply to the ADGM Courts for an order restraining a Person from transferring or disposing of any assets suspected of relating to money laundering or terrorist financing. In cases involving suspected money laundering or terrorist financing, the Regulator will usually take such action in coordination with the FIU.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  '15. DNFBP REGISTRATION AND SUPERVISION\\n15.Guidance\\n15.Guidance.1. FSMR gives the Regulator the power to supervise DNFBPs’ compliance with relevant Federal AML Legislation. FSMR also gives the Regulator a number of other powers in relation to DNFBPs, including powers of enforcement. This includes the power to obtain information and to conduct investigations into possible breaches of FSMR. The Regulator may also impose fines for breaches of FSMR or the Rules. It may also suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP in various circumstances.\\n15.Guidance.2. The Regulator takes a risk-based approach to regulation of persons which it supervises. Generally, the Regulator will work with DNFBPs to identify, assess, mitigate and control relevant risks where appropriate. The Guidance & Policies Manual (“GPM”) describes the Regulator’s enforcement powers under FSMR and outlines its policy for using these powers.\\n15.Guidance.3. Rule \\u200e15.1.1 requires a DNFBP to be registered by the Regulator to conduct its activities in the ADGM. Rule \\u200e15.2.1 sets out the criteria a DNFBP must meet to be registered. The Regulator may suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP where the DNFBP no longer meets the criteria for registration.\\n15.Guidance.4. A DNFBP is defined in Rule \\u200e3.2.1 and includes the following class of persons whose business is carried out in the ADGM:\\n(a)\\ta real estate agency which carries out transactions with other Persons that involve the acquiring or disposing of real property;\\n(b)\\ta dealer in precious metals or precious stones;\\n(c)\\ta dealer in any saleable item of a price equal to or greater than USD15,000;\\n(d)\\tan accounting firm, audit firm, insolvency firm or taxation consulting firm;\\n(e)\\ta law firm, notary firm or other independent legal business; or\\n(f)\\ta Company Service Provider.\\n15.Guidance.5. In determining if a Person is a DNFPB the Regulator will adopt a ‘substance over form’ approach. That is, it will consider what business or profession is in fact being carried on, and its main characteristics, and not just what business or profession the Person purports, or is licensed, to carry on in the ADGM.\\n15.Guidance.6. The Regulator considers that a “law firm, notary firm or other independent legal business, includes any business or profession that involves a legal service, including advice or services related to laws in the U.A.E. The Regulator does not consider it necessary for the purposes of the definition that the:\\n(a)\\tPerson is licensed to provide legal services in the U.A.E.; or\\n(b)\\tthe individuals or employees providing the legal service are qualified or authorised to do so.\\n15.Guidance.7. The Regulator considers that “accounting firm, audit firm, insolvency firm or taxation consulting firm”, includes forensic accounting services that use accounting skills, principles and techniques to investigate suspected illegal activity or to analyse financial information for use in legal proceedings.\\n15.1 DNFBP prohibition\\n15.1.1 A Person who is a DNFBP must not carry on any activities in or from the ADGM unless that Person is registered under AML 15.4 by the Regulator as a DNFBP.\\n15.1.2 The Regulator may delegate its powers for the registration, suspension and cancellation of a DNFBP’s registration to the Registrar of Companies.\\n15.2 Criteria for registration as a DNFBP\\n15.2.1\\n15.2.1.(1) To be registered as a DNFBP, an applicant must demonstrate to the Regulator’s satisfaction that:\\n(a)\\tit is fit and proper to perform AML/TFS functions; and\\n(b)\\tit has adequate resources, systems and controls, including policies and procedures, to comply with all applicable AML/TFS requirements under Federal AML Legislation, FSMR and these Rules;\\n15.2.1.(2) In assessing if an applicant is fit and proper under (1)(a), the Regulator may, without limiting the matters it may take into account under that paragraph, consider the applicant, its senior management, its Beneficial Owners, other entities in its Group and any other Person with whom it has a relationship.\\n15.2.1.(3) The Regulator will in assessing if an applicant is fit and proper, consider the cumulative effect of matters that, if considered individually, may be regarded as insufficient to give reasonable cause to doubt the fitness and propriety of the applicant.\\n15.3 Application for registration as a DNFBP\\n15.3.1 A Person may apply to the Regulator to be registered as a DNFBP by completing and submitting the appropriate form.\\n15.3.2 The Regulator may require an applicant to provide additional information or documents reasonably required by the Regulator for it to be able to consider an application for registration including, but not limited to, information or documents relating to the activities, ownership, group structure, financial and other resources of the applicant.\\n15.3.3 Where, at any time between filing an application and the grant or refusal of registration as a DNFBP, an applicant becomes aware of a material change in its circumstances that is reasonably likely to be relevant to its application it shall inform the Regulator in writing of the change without delay.\\n15.3.4 Any Person who is a DNFBP upon the making of this Chapter and was previously a Relevant Person prior to the making of this Chapter:\\n(a)\\tis deemed to be registered as a DNFBP at the time of the making of this Chapter;

or\\n(f)\\tBeneficial ownership.\\n15.6.2\\n15.6.2.(1) A DNFBP must notify the Regulator in writing at least ten Business Days in advance of it ceasing to carry on the business activities that establish it as a DNFBP.\\n15.6.2.(2) The notice must include a request to cancel its registration, an explanation of the reason for the DNFBP ceasing business, the planned date of the cessation of its activities, and copies of any relevant documents must be submitted with the notice.\\n15.7 Suspension and withdrawal of DNFBP registration\\n15.7.1\\n15.7.1.(1) The Regulator may suspend the registration of a DNFBP at the request of the DNFBP or on its own initiative.\\n15.7.1.(2) The Regulator may withdraw the registration of a DNFBP:\\n(a)\\tat the request of the DNFBP;\\n(b)\\t if the Registrar of Companies notifies it that the DNFBP no longer holds the relevant commercial licence to operate in the ADGM; or\\n(c)\\ton its own initiative.\\n15.7.2\\n15.7.2.(1) The Regulator may exercise its power on its own initiative under Rule 15.7.1 (1) or (2)(c) where:\\n(a)\\tthe DNFBP no longer meets the criteria for DNFBP registration;\\n(b)\\tthe DNFBP is in breach of, or has been in breach of, the Law or Rules or other Federal AML Legislation;\\n(c)\\tthe DNFBP is insolvent or entering into administration;\\n(d)\\tthe DNFBP is no longer carrying on business in the ADGM; or\\n(e)\\tthe Regulator considers that exercising the power is necessary or desirable in the pursuit of its objectives in section 1(3) of FSMR.\\n15.7.2.Guidance\\n15.7.2.Guidance.1. A DNFBP may request the withdrawal of its registration because, for example, it no longer meets the definition of a DNFBP, becomes insolvent or enters into administration, or proposes to leave the ADGM.\\n15.7.2.Guidance.2. In addition to being able to withdraw registration at the request of a DNFBP, the Regulator may, on its own initiative, suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP in various circumstances.\\n15.8 Disclosure of regulatory status\\n15.8.1 A DNFBP must not:\\n(a)\\tmisrepresent its regulatory status with respect to the Regulator expressly or by implication; or\\n(b)\\tuse or reproduce the logo of the Regulator without express written permission from the Regulator and in accordance with any conditions for use imposed by the Regulator.\\n15.9 Co-ordination between the Regulator and the Registrar of Companies\\n15.9.1\\n15.9.1.(1) The Registrar of Companies shall not grant a Person who is a DNFBP a commercial licence to operate in the ADGM until the Regulator has confirmed to the Registrar of Companies that it intends to register the Person as a DNFBP.\\n15.9.1.(2) The Regulator shall as soon as is practicable notify the Registrar of Companies where it suspends or withdraws the registration of a DNFBP.\\n15.9.1.(3) The Registrar of Companies shall as soon as is practicable suspend or withdraw (as the case may be) the commercial licence of the DNFBP where it receives a notification under (2).\\n',\n",

OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE OF THE AML RULEBOOK\\n2.Guidance\\n2.Guidance.1. Under Section 15A of FSMR, the Regulator has jurisdiction for the regulation of AML/TFS in the ADGM. The AML Rulebook sets out the requirements imposed by the Regulator. The U.A.E. criminal law applies in the ADGM and, therefore, Persons in the ADGM must be aware of their obligations in respect of the criminal law as well as these Rules. Relevant U.A.E. criminal laws include Federal AML Legislation and Federal Law No. (31) of 2021 (the Penal Code of the United Arab Emirates (“U.A.E.”)). The Rules in the AML Rulebook should not be relied upon to interpret or determine the application of the criminal laws of the U.A.E.\\n2.Guidance.2. Federal AML Legislation applies in the ADGM.  It is amended as required and new legislation is also published. Persons in the ADGM must ensure they have a current understanding of their obligations under Federal AML Legislation.  The definition of Federal AML Legislation is broad.  It includes all federal legislation as may be in force relating to money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing, the financing of unlawful organisations and sanctions compliance including Targeted Financial Sanctions.  Particular pieces of legislation to be aware of include:\\n(a)\\tFederal Law No. (7) of 2014 regarding Combatting Terrorism Offences;\\n(b)\\tFederal Decree Law No. (20) of 2018 on Anti-Money Laundering, Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations;\\n(c)\\tCabinet Decision No. (10) of 2019 concerning the Implementing Regulation of Decree Law No. (20) of 2018;\\n(d)\\tCabinet Decision No. (74) of 2020 concerning the Terrorism Lists Regulation and Implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions on the Suppression and Combatting of Terrorism, Terrorist Financing, Countering the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and its Financing and Relevant Resolutions.\\n2.Guidance.3. The AML Rulebook has been designed to provide a primary reference point for Relevant Persons that are supervised by the Regulator for AML/TFS compliance in accordance with the scope of application outlined in Rule \\u200e1.2.1. Accordingly it applies to all Relevant Persons, but to different degrees as provided in Rule \\u200e1.2.1(2). The AML Rulebook takes into consideration the fact that Relevant Persons have differing money laundering risk profiles. A Relevant Person should familiarise itself with the AML Rulebook and assess the extent to which the Chapters and sections apply to it. Relevant Persons should also ensure they are aware of, and take into account, all notices issued by the Regulator as well as relevant guidance and guidelines issued by governmental authorities in the U.A.E.\\n2.Guidance.4. The AML Rulebook is not intended to be read in isolation from other U.A.E. relevant legislation or developments in international policy and best practice. To the extent applicable, Relevant Persons need to be aware of, and take into account, how these may impact the Relevant Person\\'s day-to-day operations. This is particularly relevant when considering the Local Terrorist List and the United Nations Security Council (\"UNSC\") Resolutions which apply in the ADGM, and Sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions which may apply to a Relevant Person depending on the Relevant Person\\'s jurisdiction of origin, its business and/or customer base.\\n2.Guidance.5. Chapter \\u200e1 specifies who is ultimately responsible for a Relevant Person\\'s compliance with the AML Rulebook. The Regulator expects the Governing Body and Senior Management of a Relevant Person to establish a robust and effective AML/TFS compliance culture for the business.\\n2.Guidance.6. Chapter \\u200e2 provides an overview of the AML Rulebook and Chapter \\u200e3 sets out the key definitions in the AML Rulebook.\\n2.Guidance.7. Chapter \\u200e4 outlines the general compliance requirements including Group policies, notifications, record-keeping requirements and the annual AML Return.\\n2.Guidance.8. Chapter \\u200e5 explains the meaning of the risk-based approach (\"RBA\"), which should be applied when complying with the AML Rulebook. The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person\\'s business, in Chapter \\u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \\u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \\u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \\u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \\u200e8. This overlap may occur at the initial stages of onboarding of customers but may also occur when undertaking ongoing CDD.\\n2.Guidance.9. Chapter \\u200e9 sets out where a Relevant Person may rely on a third party to undertake all or some of its CDD obligations. Reliance on third-party CDD reduces the need to duplicate CDD already performed for a customer. Alternatively, a Relevant Person may outsource some or all of its CDD obligations to a service provider.\\n2.Guidance.10. Chapter \\u200e10 sets out certain obligations in relation to correspondent banking, wire transfers and other matters which are limited to Authorised Persons, other than a Credit Rating Agency, and Recognised Bodies and, in particular, to banks.\\n2.Guidance.11. Chapter \\u200e11 sets out a Relevant Person\\'s obligations in relation to both Sanctions issued by the UNSC and other Sanctions, and government, regulatory and international findings in relation to money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of weapons of mass destruction (“WMD”).\\n2.Guidance.12. Chapter \\u200e12 sets out the obligation for a Relevant Person to appoint an MLRO and the responsibilities of such a Person.\\n2.Guidance.13. Chapter \\u200e13 sets out the requirements for AML/TFS training and awareness. A Relevant Person should adopt the RBA when complying with Chapter \\u200e13, so as to make its training and awareness proportionate to the money laundering risks of the business and the role of the relevant Employee(s).\\n2.Guidance.14. Chapter \\u200e14 contains the obligations applying to all Relevant Persons concerning Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports, which are required to be made under Federal AML Legislation.\\n2.Guidance.15. Chapter \\u200e15 sets out additional obligations applying to DNFBPs, including registration and notification requirements.\\n2.Guidance.16. Chapter \\u200e16 sets out the obligations applying to Relevant Persons that are NPOs.\\n\\n\\n2.Guidance.17. The U.A.E. criminal law. Under Article 3 of Federal Decree By Law No. 20 of 2018, a Relevant Person may be criminally liable for the offence of money laundering if such an activity is intentionally committed in its name or for its account. Relevant Persons are also reminded that:\\n(a)\\tthe failure to report suspicions of money laundering;\\n(b)\\t\"tipping off\"; and\\n(c)\\tassisting in the commission of money laundering,\\nmay each constitute a criminal offence that is punishable under the laws of the U.A.E.\\n2.Guidance.18. The U.A.E. criminal law. Under Article 27 of Federal Decree Law No. (20) of 2018 on Anti-Money Laundering, Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations, Relevant Persons and their Directors and Employees are protected from criminal, civil or administrative penalty or sanction when providing any information, including confidential information, as part of a good faith report made pursuant to Federal AML Legislation to relevant regulatory bodies.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.Guidance.19. Financial Action Task Force Standards. The Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) is an inter-governmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of international standards to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\\n2.Guidance.20. Financial Action Task Force Standards. The Regulator has had regard to the FATF Recommendations in making these Rules and has determined to closely align these Rules with the FATF Recommendations, where that is deemed to be necessary and appropriate. A Relevant Person may wish to refer to the FATF Recommendations and Interpretive Notes to assist it in complying with these Rules. However, in the event that a FATF Recommendation or Interpretive Note conflicts with a Rule in the AML Rulebook, the relevant Rule takes precedence.\\n2.Guidance.21. Financial Action Task Force Standards. A Relevant Person may also wish to refer to the FATF typology reports, which may assist in identifying new money laundering threats and provide information on money laundering and terrorist and proliferation financing methods. The FATF typology reports cover many pertinent topics for Relevant Persons, including corruption, new payment methods, money laundering using trusts and Company Service Providers, and vulnerabilities of free trade zones. These typology reports can be found on the FATF website www.fatf-gafi.org.\\n\\n2.Guidance.22. Basel Committee Standards. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has published a set of guidelines for banks (Sound Management of Risks related to Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, January 2014) which are intended to supplement FATF Recommendations. Banks operating in the ADGM should read the Basel Committee guidelines in conjunction with FATF Recommendations and in complying with these Rules.\\n2.Guidance.23. Basel Committee Standards. In the event that any of the Basel Committee guidelines conflict with a Rule in the AML Rulebook, the relevant Rule takes precedence.\\n\\n2.Guidance.24. Wolfsberg Group. The Wolfsberg Group is an association of thirteen global banks that has published guidance aimed at assisting financial institutions in managing money laundering risks (Wolfsberg Statement Guidance on a Risk Based Approach for Managing Money Laundering Risks, March 2006) and in preventing terrorist financing (Wolfsberg Statement on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, January 2002). Banks operating in the ADGM should be familiar with relevant Wolfsberg Group published guidance in conjunction with the FATF Recommendations and in complying with these Rules.\\n2.Guidance.25. Wolfsberg Group. In the event that any part of the Wolfsberg Group published guidance conflicts with a Rule in the AML Rulebook, the relevant Rule takes precedence.\\n\\n2.Guidance.26. Sanctions. The U.A.E., as a member of the United Nations, is required to comply with all Sanctions issued by the UNSC. The U.A.E. also periodically publicises its own Sanctions. Targeted Financial Sanctions (“TFS”) are Sanctions issued by the UNSC or the U.A.E. involving asset freezing and other financial prohibitions targeted at individuals, entities or groups with the aim of combatting terrorism and terrorist financing, and countering the proliferation of WMD.\\n2.Guidance.27. Sanctions. UNSC Sanctions and Sanctions issued or administered by the U.A.E., including Targeted Financial Sanctions, apply in the ADGM.  Relevant Persons must comply with Targeted Financial Sanctions. Sanctions compliance is emphasised by specific obligations contained in the AML Rulebook requiring Relevant Persons to establish and maintain effective systems and controls to comply with applicable Sanctions, including in particular Targeted Financial Sanctions, as set out in Chapter \\u200e11.\\n2.Guidance.28. Sanctions. The FATF has issued guidance on Targeted Financial Sanctions.  Such guidance has been issued to assist in implementing the Targeted Financial Sanctions and activity-based financial prohibitions. This guidance can be found on the FATF website www.fatf-gafi.org.\\n2.Guidance.29. Sanctions. Sanctions and the import and export controls imposed or administered by other national and supranational bodies may apply or be relevant to a Relevant Person or its operations and the conduct of its business. In particular, Sanctions administered by the European Union, the U.K. (“HM Treasury”) and the U.S. (Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)) may need to be carefully considered. The Regulator expects a Relevant Person to consider and take positive steps to ensure compliance where required or appropriate.\\n\\n3. INTERPRETATION AND TERMINOLOGY\\n3.1 Interpretation\\n3.1.1 A reference in the AML Rulebook to \"money laundering\" in lower case includes terrorist financing, proliferation financing, the financing of unlawful organisations and sanctions non-compliance including non-compliance with Targeted Financial Sanctions, unless the context provides or implies otherwise.\\n3.2 Glossary for AML\\n3.2.Guidance Guidance on the term \"customer\"\\n3.2.Guidance.1. The point at which a Person becomes a customer will vary from business to business. However, the Regulator considers that it would usually occur at or prior to the business relationship being formalised, for example, by the signing of a client agreement or the acceptance by the customer of terms of business.\\n3.2.Guidance.2. The Regulator does not consider that a Person would be a customer of a Relevant Person merely because such Person receives marketing information from a Relevant Person or where a Relevant Person refers a Person who is not a customer to a third party, including a Group member.\\n3.2.Guidance.3. The Regulator considers that a Counterparty would generally be a customer for the purposes of the AML Rulebook and would therefore require a Relevant Person to undertake CDD on such a Person. However, this would not include a counterparty in a Transaction undertaken on a Regulated Exchange. Nor would it include suppliers of ancillary business services for consumption by the Relevant Person such as cleaning, catering, stationery, IT or other similar services.\\n3.2.Guidance.4. A Representative Office should not have any customers in relation to its ADGM operations.\\n3.2.1 The following terms and abbreviations bear the following meanings for the purposes of these Rules.\\n\\n/Table Start\\nTerm\\tDefinition\\nADGM\\tMeans the Abu Dhabi Global Market.\\nADGM Entity\\tMeans a Legal Person which is incorporated or registered in the ADGM, excluding a registered Branch.\\nAML Rulebook \\tMeans the Anti Money Laundering and Sanctions Rules and Guidance Rulebook.\\nAML Return\\tMeans the return which is required to be completed by Relevant Persons in accordance with AML \\u200e4.6.\\n\\nAML/TFS\\tMeans anti-money laundering, including measures undertaken against terrorist financing, proliferation financing, financing of unlawful organisations and sanctions non-compliance, and the observance of and compliance with applicable Sanctions including Targeted Financial Sanctions.\\nAuthorised Person\\tMeans a Person, other than a Recognised Body, who is authorised under the FSMR.\\nBeneficial Owners\\tMeans, in relation to a customer, a Natural Person who ultimately owns or controls the customer or a Natural Person on whose behalf a transaction is conducted or a business relationship is established and includes:\\n(a) \\tin relation to a body corporate, a Person referred to in Rule \\u200e8.3.3(2);\\n(b) \\tin relation to a Partnership, a Person referred to in Rule \\u200e8.3.4(2);\\n(c) \\tin relation to a trust or other similar Legal Arrangement, a Person referred to in Rule \\u200e8.3.5(2); and\\n(d) \\tin relation to a foundation, a Person referred to in Rule \\u200e8.3.6(2).\\n\\nBody Corporate\\tMeans any body corporate, including limited liability partnership and a body corporate constituted under the law of a country or territory outside of the ADGM.\\nClient\\tMeans a Retail Client, Professional Client or Market Counterparty as defined in COBS 2.\\nClient Agreement\\tMeans an agreement between an Authorised Person and a Client which is made or entered into in accordance with COBS 3.3.\\nClient Money\\tMeans money of any currency which an Authorised Person holds on behalf of a Client, including any receivables of the Authorised Person in respect of bank accounts or clearing or brokerage accounts, or which an Authorised Person treats as Client Money, subject to the exclusions in COBS 14.2.6.\\nCOBS\\tMeans the Conduct of Business Rulebook.\\nCompany\\tIncludes:\\n(a) \\tany Body Corporate wherever incorporated; and\\n(b) \\tany unincorporated body constituted under the law of a country, territory or jurisdiction outside the ADGM.\\nCompany Service Provider\\tMeans a Person that, carries out the following services on behalf of a customer:\\n(a) \\tacting as a formation agent of Legal Persons;\\n(b) \\tacting as, or arranging for another Person to act as, a director or secretary of a company, a partner of a partnership or a similar position in relation to other Legal Persons or Legal Arrangements;\\n(c) \\tproviding a registered office, business address or accommodation, correspondence or administrative address for a company, a partnership or any other Legal Person or Legal Arrangement;\\n(d) \\tacting as, or arranging for another Person to act as, a trustee of an express trust or performing the equivalent function for another form of Legal Arrangement; or\\n(e) \\tacting as, or arranging for another Person to act as, a nominee shareholder for another Person.\\nContract of Insurance \\tHas the meaning given in Part 4 of Schedule 1 of FSMR.\\nContravention\\tMeans a contravention of any Regulations or Rules made by the ADGM Board and the Regulator, as the case may be.\\nCorrespondent Account\\tMeans an account opened on behalf of a Correspondent Banking Client to receive deposits from, to make payments on behalf of or to otherwise handle financial transactions for or on behalf of the Correspondent Banking Client.\\nCorrespondent Bank\\tMeans a bank in a jurisdiction other than the ADGM where an Authorised Person opens a Correspondent Account.\\nCorrespondent Banking Client\\tMeans a Client of an Authorised Person which uses the firm\\'s correspondent banking services account to clear transactions for its own customer base.\\nCounterparty\\tMeans any Person with or for whom an Authorised Person carries on, or intends to carry on, any regulated business or associated business.

or\\n(d)\\tbecomes aware of a significant breach of a Rule in the AML Rulebook or breach of relevant Federal AML Legislation.\\n4.4.2 A Relevant Person must inform the Regulator in writing as soon as possible if, in the course of its activities carried on in or from the ADGM, it suspects or becomes aware that another Person outside of its business is engaged in:\\n(a)\\tmoney laundering, contrary to relevant Federal AML Legislation;\\n(b)\\ta breach of Sanctions; or\\n(c)\\tacts amounting to bribery under the OECD Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.\\nThis requirement does not apply to information or documents that are legally privileged or in the public domain.\\n4.5 Record keeping\\n4.5.1 A Relevant Person must, where relevant, maintain the following records:\\n(a)\\ta copy of all documents and information obtained in undertaking initial and ongoing CDD or due diligence on business partners;\\n(b)\\trecords, consisting of the original documents or certified copies, in respect of the customer business relationship, including:\\n(i)\\tbusiness correspondence and other information relating to a customer’s account;\\n(ii)\\tsufficient records of transactions to enable individual transactions to be reconstructed;

This includes the obligation for the Relevant Person to maintain a copy of all documents obtained during initial and ongoing CDD. Where using eKYC for CDD, the Relevant Person should retain all the necessary data gathered during biometric authentication to ensure compliance with applicable Rules.\\n4.5.2 A Relevant Person must immediately provide to the Regulator, upon request, or a law enforcement agency, pursuant to a valid and enforceable request or requirement, a copy of the record referred to in Rule 4.5.1.\\n4.5.2.Guidance \\nThe Regulator expects that a Relevant Person will be able to ordinarily provide the records within one Business Day of a request from the Regulator.\\n4.5.3 A Relevant Person must document, and provide to the Regulator immediately, any of the following:\\n(a)\\tthe risk assessment of its business as required by Rule \\u200e\\u200e6.1.1;\\n(b)\\thow the assessment in (a) was used for the purposes of complying with Rule \\u200e6.1.2;\\n(c)\\tthe risk assessment of the customer undertaken under Rule \\u200e\\u200e7.1.1(1)(a); and\\n(d)\\tthe determination made under Rule \\u200e\\u200e7.1.1(1)(b).\\n4.5.4 The records maintained by a Relevant Person must be kept in such a manner that:\\n(a)\\tthe Regulator or another competent third party is able to assess the Relevant Person\\'s compliance with legislation applicable in the ADGM;\\n(b)\\tany Transaction which was processed by or through the Relevant Person on behalf of a customer or other third party can be reconstructed;\\n(c)\\tany customer or third party can be identified;\\n(d)\\tall internal notifications of suspicious activity made to its MLRO under Rule \\u200e14.2.2, and all Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports, can be identified; and\\n(e)\\tthe Relevant Person can satisfy, within an appropriate time, any regulatory enquiry or court order to disclose information.\\n4.5.4.Guidance\\n4.5.4.Guidance.1. The records required to be kept under Rule 4.5.1 may be kept in electronic format, provided that such records are readily accessible and available to respond promptly to any requests from the Regulator for information.\\n4.5.4.Guidance.2. If the date on which the business relationship with a customer ended is unclear, it may be taken to have ended on the date of the completion of the last Transaction.\\n4.5.5 Where the records referred to in Rule 4.5.1 are kept by a Relevant Person outside the ADGM, a Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\ttake reasonable steps to ensure that the records are held in a manner consistent with these Rules;\\n(b)\\tensure that the records are easily accessible to the Relevant Person; and\\n(c)\\tupon request by the Regulator, ensure that the records are immediately available for inspection.\\n4.5.6 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tidentify where there is secrecy or data protection legislation that might restrict access without delay to the records referred to in Rule \\u200e4.6.1 by the Relevant Person, the Regulator or the law enforcement agencies of the U.A.E.; and\\n(b)\\twhere such legislation exists, obtain without delay certified copies of the relevant records and keep such copies in a jurisdiction which allows access by those persons in (a).\\n4.5.7 A Relevant Person must be able to demonstrate that it has complied with the training and awareness requirements in Chapter \\u200e13 through appropriate measures, including the maintenance of relevant training records.\\n4.5.7.Guidance \\nThe Regulator considers that \"appropriate measures\" in Rule 4.5.7 may include the maintenance of a training log setting out details of:\\n(a)\\tthe dates when the training was given;\\n(b)\\tthe nature of the training; and\\n(c)\\tthe names of Employees who received the training.\\n4.6 Annual AML Return\\n4.6.1 A Relevant Person must complete the prescribed AML Return form and submit it to the Regulator by the end of April each year. The AML Return must cover the period from 1 January to 31 December of the preceding year.\\n4.6.1.Guidance\\n4.6.1.Guidance.1. The Regulator may grant a Waiver where a Relevant Person was licensed or authorised, as applicable, on or after 1 November of the relevant reporting year.\\n4.6.1.Guidance.2. FEES 1.2.7 sets out the fees payable for late submission of Regulatory Filings. In addition to the imposition of a fee, the Regulator may take further action.\\n4.7 Co-operation with the Regulator\\n4.7.1 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tbe open and co-operative in all its dealings with the Regulator; and\\n(b)\\tensure that any communication with the Regulator is conducted in the English language.\\n4.8 Employee disclosures\\n4.8.1 A Relevant Person must ensure that it does not prejudice an Employee who discloses any information regarding money laundering to the Regulator or to any other relevant body involved in the prevention of money laundering.\\n4.8.1.Guidance \\nThe Regulator considers that a \"relevant body\" in Rule 4.8.1 would include the FIU, any other financial intelligence unit, the police, or an Abu Dhabi or Federal ministry or authority.\\n\\n\\n5. APPLYING A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO AML/TFS\\n5.1 The risk-based approach\\n5.1.1 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tassess and address its money laundering risks under the AML Rulebook by reviewing the risks to which the Relevant Person is exposed as a result of the nature of its business, customers, products, services and any other matters which are relevant in the context of money laundering; and\\n(b)\\tensure that any risk-based assessment undertaken for the purposes of complying with a requirement in the AML Rulebook is:\\n(i)\\tobjective and proportionate to the risks;\\n(ii)\\tbased on reasonable grounds;\\n(iii)\\tproperly documented; and\\n(iv)\\tupdated at appropriate intervals.\\n5.1.1.Guidance\\n5.1.1.Guidance.1. Rule \\u200e5.1.1 requires a Relevant Person to adopt an approach to AML/TFS which is proportionate to the risks. This is called the \"risk-based approach\" (\"RBA\"). The Regulator expects the RBA to be a key part of the Relevant Person\\'s AML/TFS compliance culture and to cascade down from the Senior Management to the rest of the organisation. Embedding the RBA within its business allows a Relevant Person to make decisions and allocate AML/TFS resources in the most efficient and effective way.\\n5.1.1.Guidance.2. In implementing the RBA, a Relevant Person is expected to have in place processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate money laundering risks. The general principle is that where there are higher risks of money laundering, a Relevant Person is required to take enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks. Correspondingly, when the risks are lower, simplified measures are permitted. Simplified measures are not permitted where there is a suspicion of money laundering.\\n5.1.1.Guidance.3. The RBA should not be seen as a \"tick-box\" approach to AML/TFS. Instead a Relevant Person is required to assess relevant money laundering risks and adopt a proportionate response to such risks, however, even where a customer is assessed through the RBA as being low-risk a minimum of simplified CDD must be undertaken in relation to that customer.\\n5.1.1.Guidance.4. In adopting an RBA, a Relevant Person should continue to meet the requirements that are mandated under the AML Rulebook including:\\n(a)\\tassessing the relevant money laundering risks in accordance with Chapter \\u200e6 or Chapter \\u200e7 of AML (as applicable);\\n(b)\\tundertaking CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.3.1;\\n(c)\\tundertaking Enhanced CDD pursuant to Rule \\u200e8.1.1(3) in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.4.1; and\\n(d)\\tundertaking Simplified CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.5.1 where permissible pursuant to Rule \\u200e8.1.1(4).\\n5.1.1.Guidance.5. Section 4.5 sets out the requirements regarding record-keeping for the purposes of the AML Rulebook. These Rules apply in relation to Rule \\u200e5.1.1(b)(iii).\\n\\n\\n6. BUSINESS RISK ASSESSMENT\\n6.1 Assessing the money laundering risks of a business\\n6.1.1 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\ttake appropriate steps to identify and assess money laundering risks to which its business is exposed, taking into consideration the nature, size and complexity of its activities. Relevant Persons must take into account that money laundering risks include the risk of terrorist financing, proliferation financing, the financing of unlawful organisations and sanctions non-compliance including non-compliance with Targeted Financial Sanctions.\\n(b)\\twhen identifying and assessing the risks in (a), take into account, to the extent relevant, any vulnerabilities relating to:\\n(i)\\tits type of customers and their activities;\\n(ii)\\tthe countries or geographic areas in which it does business;\\n(iii)\\tits products, services and activity profiles;\\n(iv)\\tits distribution channels and business partners;\\n(v)\\tthe complexity and volume of its Transactions;\\n(vi)\\tthe development of new products and business practices including new delivery mechanisms, channels and partners;\\n(vii)\\tthe use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre existing products and services; and\\n(c)\\ttake appropriate measures to ensure that any risk identified as part of the assessment in (a) is taken into account in its day-to-day operations and is mitigated, including in relation to:\\n(i)\\tthe development of new products;\\n(ii)\\tthe taking on of new customers; and\\n(iii)\\tchanges to its business profile.\\n6.1.2 A Relevant Person must use the information obtained in undertaking its business risk assessment to:\\n(a)\\tdevelop and maintain its AML/TFS policies, procedures, systems and controls as required by Rule \\u200e6.2.1;\\n(b)\\tensure that its AML/TFS policies, procedures, systems and controls adequately mitigate the risks identified as part of the assessment in Rule \\u200e6.1.1;\\n(c)\\tassess the effectiveness of its AML/TFS policies, procedures, systems and controls as required by Rule \\u200e6.2.1(c);\\n(d)\\tassist in the allocation and prioritisation of AML/TFS resources; and\\n(e)\\tassist in the carrying out of the customer risk assessment under Chapter \\u200e7.\\n6.1.3 Without limiting compliance with Rules \\u200e6.1.1 and \\u200e6.1.2, prior to launching any new product, service, or business practice, or using a new or developing technology, a Relevant Person must take reasonable steps to ensure that it has:\\n(a)\\tassessed and identified the money laundering risks relating to the product, service, business practice or technology; and\\n(b)\\ttaken appropriate steps to mitigate or eliminate the risks identified under (a).\\n6.1.3.Guidance\\n6.1.3.Guidance.1. Unless a Relevant Person understands the money laundering risks to which it is exposed, it cannot take appropriate steps to prevent its business from being used for the purposes of money laundering. Money laundering risks vary from business to business depending on the nature of the business, the type of customers a business has, the nature of the products and services sold, and the geographical operations in which it operates.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.2. Using the RBA, a Relevant Person should assess its own vulnerabilities to money laundering and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks. The results of this assessment will also feed into the Relevant Person\\'s risk assessment of its customers under Chapter \\u200e7.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.3. In addition to assessing risk arising from money laundering, a business risk assessment should assess the potential exposure of a Relevant Person to other Financial Crime, such as fraud and the theft of personal data. The business risk assessment should also address the Relevant Person’s potential exposure to cyber security risk, as this risk may have a material impact on the Relevant Person’s ability to prevent Financial Crime.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.4. A Relevant Person should, as a separate and distinct element of its business risk assessment, undertake a Targeted Financial Sanctions risk assessment in order to identify, understand, assess and mitigate those risks. This should include conducting a proliferation financing and terrorist financing risk assessment.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.5. A Relevant Person should, prior to launching any new product, service or business practice, pay specific attention to assessing the potential for risks associated with all applicable aspects of Financial Crime. This is especially important given the innovative nature of any such new offering as the Relevant Person may be less familiar with the functioning of the offering, compared to existing offerings.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.6. Similarly, in using a new or developing technology, such as those associated with the Regulated Activity of Developing Financial Technology Services within the RegLab or when undertaking NFTF business, a Relevant Person should pay specific attention to assessing the potential for risks associated with Financial Crime that might arise as a result of implementing that innovative technology. For example, while the use of eKYC Systems may reduce the risk of impersonation fraud at customer onboarding, NFTF interaction with the customer may increase the risk of Financial Crime after a business relationship has been established, through transaction fraud, money laundering or theft of digitally stored CDD documentation.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.7. A business risk assessment under Rule \\u200e6.1.1(b) should include an assessment of the risks associated with the carrying on of NFTF business, particularly the use of eKYC Systems. The assessment should consider incorporating any relevant mitigation measures identified by the Regulator, a competent authority of the U.A.E., FATF, and any other relevant bodies.\\n\\n\\n6.2 AML/TFS systems and controls\\n6.2.1 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\testablish and maintain effective policies, procedures, systems and controls to prevent opportunities for money laundering in relation to the Relevant Person and its activities;\\n(b)\\tensure that its systems and controls in (a):\\n(i)\\tinclude the provision to the Relevant Person\\'s Senior Management of regular management information on the operation and effectiveness of its AML/TFS systems and controls necessary to identify, measure, manage and control the Relevant Person\\'s money laundering risks;\\n(ii)\\tenable it to determine whether a customer or a Beneficial Owner is a PEP;\\n(iii)\\tenable the Relevant Person to comply with these Rules and Federal AML Legislation; and\\n(iv)\\tenable the Relevant Person to comply with the Penal Code; and\\n(c)\\tensure that regular risk assessments are carried out on the adequacy of the Relevant Person\\'s AML/TFS systems and controls to ensure that they continue to enable it to identify, assess, monitor and manage money laundering risk adequately, and are comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of its activities.\\n6.2.1.Guidance\\n6.2.1.Guidance.1. In Rule \\u200e6.2.1(c) the frequency of risk assessments will depend on the nature, size and complexity of the Relevant Person\\'s business and also on when any material changes are made to its business. The risk assessments should also take into account a range of financial crime, including fraud, bribery and corruption.\\n6.2.1.Guidance.2. The risk assessment under Rule \\u200e6.2.1(c) should identify actions to mitigate risks associated with undertaking NFTF business generally, and the use of eKYC specifically. This is because distinct risks are often likely to arise where business is conducted entirely in an NFTF manner, compared to when the business relationship includes a mix of face-to-face and NFTF interactions. The assessment should make reference to risk mitigation measures recommended by the Regulator, a competent authority of the U.A.E., FATF, and other relevant bodies.\\n\\n\\n7. CUSTOMER RISK ASSESSMENT\\n7.Guidance\\n7.Guidance.1. This Chapter prescribes the risk-based assessment that must be undertaken by a Relevant Person on a customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product. The outcome of this process is to produce a risk rating for a customer, which determines the level of CDD that must be undertaken in relation to that customer under Chapter \\u200e8. Chapter \\u200e8 prescribes the requirements of CDD, Enhanced CDD for high-risk customers and, where appropriate, Simplified CDD for low-risk customers.\\n7.Guidance.2. CDD in the context of AML/TFS refers to the process of identifying a customer, verifying such identification and monitoring the customer\\'s business and the potential for any money laundering risk on an ongoing basis. CDD is required to be completed following a risk-based assessment of the customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product.\\n7.Guidance.3. Relevant Persons should note that the ongoing CDD requirements in Rule \\u200e\\u200e8.6.1 require a Relevant Person to review a customer\\'s risk rating to ensure that it remains appropriate in light of the potential money laundering risks.\\n7.Guidance.4. The risk-based assessment of the customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product required under this Chapter is required to be undertaken prior to the establishment of a business relationship with a customer. Because the risk rating assigned to a customer resulting from this assessment determines the level of CDD that must be undertaken for that customer, this process must be completed before the CDD is completed for the customer. The Regulator is aware that in practice there will often be some degree of overlap between the customer risk assessment and CDD. For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment. Where information obtained as part of CDD of a customer affects the risk rating of a customer, the change in risk rating should be reflected in the degree of CDD undertaken.\\n7.1 Assessing the money laundering risks of a customer\\n7.1.1\\n7.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tundertake a risk-based assessment of every customer; and\\n(b)\\tassign the customer a risk rating proportionate to the assessed money laundering risks associated with the customer.\\n7.1.1.(2) The customer risk assessment in (1) must be completed:\\n(a)\\tprior to establishing a business relationship with a customer;\\n(b)\\ton a periodic basis, in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.6.1(e); and\\n(c)\\twhenever it is otherwise appropriate for existing customers, including where the Relevant Person becomes aware of any change to the risk factors associated with the customer that might contribute to the potential for money laundering risk to increase materially.\\n7.1.1.(3) When undertaking a risk-based assessment of a customer under \\u200e7.1.1(1)\\u200e(a), a Relevant Person must identify, assess and consider:\\n(a)\\tthe customer and any Beneficial Owners;\\n(b)\\tthe purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, and the nature of the customer’s business;\\n(c)\\tthe nature, ownership and control structure of the customer, its beneficial ownership (if any) and its business;\\n(d)\\tthe customer\\'s country of origin, residence, nationality, place of incorporation or place of business;\\n(e)\\tthe relevant product, service or Transaction;\\n(f)\\tin relation to life insurance or other similar insurance policies, the beneficiary of the policy and Beneficial Owners of the beneficiary;

and\\n(B)\\teffectively implement FATF Recommendations.\\n7.1.3.(2) For the purposes of \\u200e7.1.3(1)(c), a credible source includes, but is not limited to, mutual evaluations, detailed assessment reports or follow-up reports issued by FATF, the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD and other International Organisations.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on the customer risk assessment\\n7.1.3.Guidance on the customer risk assessment.1. The risk assessment of a customer requires a Relevant Person to allocate an appropriate risk rating to the customer. Risk ratings should be either descriptive, such as \"low”, “medium” or \"high\", or a sliding, ordinal numeric scale such as 1 for the lowest risk to 10 for the highest, with at least three differentiated risk ratings. All the factors set out in both \\u200e7.1.2 and \\u200e7.1.3 should be considered in order to assess and allocate the appropriate risk rating to the customer.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on the customer risk assessment.2. Depending on the outcome of a Relevant Person\\'s assessment of its customer\\'s money laundering risk, a Relevant Person should decide to what degree CDD will need to be performed. For a customer exhibiting significant potential risk for money laundering the Relevant Person is required to carry out Enhanced CDD under Rule \\u200e8.4, in addition to the normal CDD required under Rule \\u200e8.3. For a customer rated low risk, the Relevant Person may be able to carry out Simplified CDD under Rule \\u200e8.5. For any other customer, the Relevant Person must undertake CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on the customer risk assessment.3. Using the RBA, a Relevant Person could, when assessing two customers with near identical risk profiles, consider that one is high-risk and the other low-risk. This may occur, for example, where both customers may be undertaking the same high-risk activity, but one customer may be a customer in relation to a low-risk product, or may be a long-standing customer of a Group company which has been introduced to the Relevant Person.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on high-risk customers\\n7.1.3.Guidance on high-risk customers .1. When assessing the risk factors referred to in \\u200e7.1.2(1), the presence of one or more risk factors may not always indicate a high risk of money laundering in a particular situation.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on high-risk customers .2. An example of a business relationship conducted in unusual circumstances, for the purposes of Rule \\u200e7.1.2(1)(a)(i), would include, but is not limited to a business relationship or proposed business relationship that involves, or would involve, significant unexplained geographic distance between the location of the Relevant Person and the customer or proposed customer.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on high-risk customers .3. The highest risk products or services in respect of money laundering are those where unlimited third-party funds can be freely received from or paid to third parties, without evidence of the identity of the third parties being obtained and the identity being verified.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on high-risk customers .4. Money laundering risks are likely to be increased if a Person is able to hide behind corporate structures such as limited companies, trusts, special purpose vehicles and nominee arrangements. When devising its internal procedures, a Relevant Person should consider how its customers and operational systems impact the capacity of its staff to identify suspicious activities and Transactions. Generally, the lowest risk products in respect of money laundering are those where funds can only be received from a named customer by way of payment from an account held in the customer\\'s name, and similarly where the funds can only be remitted to a named customer.\\n7.1.3.Guidance on low-risk customers \\nWhen assessing the risk factors referred to in \\u200e7.1.3(1), a Relevant Person must bear in mind that the presence or absence of one or more risk factors may not always indicate a high or low risk of money laundering respectively in a particular situation.\\n7.2 Prohibition on establishing business relationships with certain customers\\n7.2.1 A Relevant Person must not establish a business relationship with a prospective customer that is a Legal Person or Legal Arrangement if the ownership or control arrangements of the customer prevents the Relevant Person from identifying one or more of the customer\\'s Beneficial Owners.\\n7.2.2 A Relevant Person must not establish or maintain a business relationship with a Shell Bank.\\n7.2.3 A Relevant Person must not knowingly establish or maintain an anonymous account, an account in a fictitious name, or a nominee account which is held in the name of one Person but which is controlled by or held for the benefit of another Person whose true identity has not been disclosed to the Relevant Person.\\n7.2.3.Guidance\\n7.2.3.Guidance.1. In Rule \\u200e7.2.1, ownership arrangements which may prevent the Relevant Person from identifying one or more Beneficial Owners include bearer shares and other negotiable instruments in which ownership is determined by possession.\\n7.2.3.Guidance.2. A Shell Bank is a bank that has no physical presence in the country in which it is incorporated and licensed, and which is unaffiliated with a regulated financial Group that is subject to effective consolidated supervision. The Regulator does not consider that the existence of a local agent or low-level staff constitutes physical presence.\\n7.2.4 If a Relevant Person uses a numbered account with an abbreviated name, it must ensure that:\\n(a)\\tsuch an account is used only for internal purposes;\\n(b)\\tit has undertaken the same CDD procedures in relation to the account holder as are required for other account holders;\\n(c)\\tit maintains the same information in relation to the account and account holder as is required for other accounts and account holders; and\\n(d)\\tstaff performing AML/TFS functions, including staff responsible for identifying and monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, and staff performing compliance and audit functions, have full access to information about the account and the account holder.\\n7.2.4.Guidance on anonymous accounts \\nA Relevant Person should note that, in addition to the prohibition in Rule 7.2.3 against knowingly establishing anonymous accounts, accounts in a fictitious name or nominee accounts, the Federal AML Legislation also prohibits the opening of accounts held under borrowed, mock or fake names or accounts designated solely with numbers and without the names of account holders.\\n7.2.4.Guidance on Restricted Scope Companies\\n7.2.4.Guidance on Restricted Scope Companies.1. A Restricted Scope Company is a corporate vehicle offering a greater degree of confidentiality than other forms of corporate entity in the ADGM. Restricted Scope Companies are not required to file accounts and are not required to have their accounts audited. Restricted Scope Companies must file an annual return, articles, and details of their registered offices, directors and secretary (if they have one) with the ADGM Registrar of Companies.\\n7.2.4.Guidance on Restricted Scope Companies.2. Relevant Persons will know that Restricted Scope Companies are subject to less onerous corporate disclosure requirements than other forms of corporate entities due to the requirement to have \"(Restricted)\" in a company\\'s name. Given that only the constitution and details of the registered office of a Restricted Scope Company will be available in a public register, a Relevant Person will be required to have a bilateral dialogue with the Restricted Scope Company, in accordance with the RBA, to obtain any other relevant information which it needs to assess the money laundering risks to which it is exposed.\\n7.2.4.Guidance on Restricted Scope Companies.3. Restricted Scope Companies should be forthcoming with relevant information in response to requests by other Persons and entities for the purpose of compliance of the latter with the requirements in the AML Rulebook. The fact that Restricted Scope Companies are not subject to strict standards of disclosure of corporate documentation to a public registry should not be interpreted by Restricted Scope Companies to limit or prohibit their providing of any relevant information to other Persons and entities for AML/TFS purposes.\\n\\n\\n8. CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE\\n8.1 Requirement to undertake Customer Due Diligence\\n8.1.1\\n8.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person that is an Authorised Person or a Recognised Body must undertake CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.1 where the Relevant Person:\\n(a)\\testablishes a business relationship with a customer;\\n(b)\\tcarries out an occasional Transaction for a customer that is of an amount equal to or more than USD15,000;\\n(c)\\tsuspects a customer of, or a Transaction to be for the purposes of, money laundering; or\\n(d)\\tdoubts the veracity or adequacy of any documents or information previously provided by, or obtained for, a customer in relation to (a), (b) or (c) above.\\n8.1.1.(2) A Relevant Person that is a DNFBP must undertake CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.1 where it:\\n(a)\\tis a real estate agency and it prepares for or is involved in a Transaction, or the provision of real estate agency services to a Person, that involves the buying and selling of real property;\\n(b)\\tis a dealer in precious metals or precious stones and it is involved in a Transaction in cash that amounts to USD15,000 or more, whether or not the Transaction is executed in a single operation or in several operations that are or appear to be linked;\\n(c)\\tis a dealer in any saleable item of a price equal to or greater than USD15,000 and it is involved in a Transaction in cash that amounts to USD15,000 or more, whether or not the Transaction is executed in a single operation or in several operations that are or appear to be linked;\\n(d)\\tis an accounting firm, audit firm, insolvency firm or taxation consulting firm and it prepares for or is involved in the provision of accounting, auditing, insolvency or taxation consulting services to a Person;\\n(e)\\tis a law firm, notary firm or other independent legal business and it prepares for or is involved in the provision of legal or notarial services to another Person participating in financial or real property Transactions concerning the following activities:\\n(i)\\tthe buying and selling of real property;\\n(ii)\\tthe managing of client money, securities or other assets;\\n(iii)\\tthe management of bank, savings or securities accounts;\\n(iv)\\tthe organisation of contributions for the creation, operation or management of companies; or\\n(v)\\tthe creation, operation or management of legal persons or arrangements, and buying and selling of business entities;\\n(f)\\tis a Company Service Provider and it prepares for or is involved in the provision of any of the following services to another Person:\\n(i)\\tacting as a formation agent of Legal Persons or Legal Arrangements;\\n(ii)\\tacting as, or arranging for another Person to act as, a director or secretary of a company, a partner of a partnership, or a similar position in relation to other Legal Persons or Legal Arrangements;\\n(iii)\\tproviding a registered office, business address or accommodation, correspondence or administrative address for a company, a partnership or any other Legal Person or Legal Arrangement;\\n(iv)\\tacting as, or arranging for another Person to act as, a trustee of an express trust or performing the equivalent function for another form of Legal Arrangement; or\\n(v)\\tacting as, or arranging for another Person to act as, a nominee shareholder for another Person.\\n8.1.1.(3) In addition to undertaking CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.3.1, a Relevant Person must undertake Enhanced CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.4.1 for each of its customers assigned a high-risk rating;\\n8.1.1.(4) A Relevant Person may undertake Simplified CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.5.1 by modifying the CDD undertaken in accordance with Rule \\u200e\\u200e8.3.1 for any customer assigned a low-risk rating.\\n8.1.1.Guidance\\n8.1.1.Guidance.1. Relevant Persons are reminded that they are required to comply with notices and guidance issued pursuant to Federal AML Legislation in relation to CDD, including those issued by the FIU relating to CDD and filings required in goAML.\\n8.1.1.Guidance.2. The FIU has issued guides that require:\\n(a)\\ta DNFBP that is a dealer in precious metals or precious stones to obtain relevant identification documents, such as passport, emirates ID, trade licence, as applicable, and register the information via goAML for all cash transactions equal to or exceeding USD15,000 with individuals and all cash or wire transfer transactions equal to or exceeding USD15,000 with entities. The Regulator expects a dealer in any saleable item or a price equal to or greater than USD15,000 to also comply with this requirement;\\n(b)\\ta DNFBP that is a real estate agent to obtain relevant identification documents, such as passport, emirates ID, trade licence, as applicable, and register the information via goAML for all sales or purchases of Real Property where:\\n(i)\\tthe payment for the sale/purchase includes a total cash payment of USD15,000 or more whether in a single cash payment or multiple cash payments;\\n(ii)\\tthe payment for any part or all of the sale/purchase amount includes payment(s) using Virtual Assets;\\n(iii)\\tthe payment for any part or all of the sale/purchase amount includes funds that were converted from or to a Virtual Asset.\\n8.1.2\\n8.1.2.(1) A Relevant Person must also apply CDD measures to each existing customer under Rules \\u200e8.3.1, \\u200e8.4.1 or \\u200e8.5.1 as applicable:\\n(a)\\twith a frequency appropriate to the outcome of the risk-based approach taken in relation to each customer; and\\n(b)\\twhen the Relevant Person becomes aware that any circumstances relevant to its risk assessment for a customer have changed.\\n8.1.2.(2) For the purposes of \\u200e8.1.2(1), in determining when it is appropriate to apply CDD measures in relation to existing customers, a Relevant Person must take into account, amongst other things:\\n(a)\\tany indication that the identity of the customer, or the customer’s Beneficial Owners, has changed;\\n(b)\\tany Transactions that are not reasonably consistent with the Relevant Person’s knowledge of the customer;\\n(c)\\tany change in the purpose or intended nature of the Relevant Person’s relationship with the customer; or\\n(d)\\tany other matter that might affect the Relevant Person’s risk assessment of the customer.\\n8.1.2.Guidance\\n8.1.2.Guidance.1. A Relevant Person should undertake appropriate CDD in a manner proportionate to the customer\\'s money laundering risks. This means that all customers are subject to CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.1. However, for high-risk customers, additional Enhanced Customer Due Diligence measures should also be undertaken under Rule \\u200e8.4.1. For customers having a low-risk rating, the requirements under Rule \\u200e8.3.1 may be modified according to the assessed risk, in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.5.1.\\n8.1.2.Guidance.2. The frequency for undertaking CDD for existing customers will be determined by the risk rating assigned to a particular customer. The Regulator expects that customers rated high risk for money laundering should be reviewed more frequently than customers rated lower risk for money laundering.\\n8.1.2.Guidance.3. A Relevant Person should undertake CDD to guard against a range of money laundering risks as well as a range of financial crime risks, including fraud.\\n8.2 Timing of Customer Due Diligence\\n8.2.1\\n8.2.1.(1) For a Relevant Person that is an Authorised Person or Recognised Body:\\n(a)\\tthe appropriate CDD obligations, subject to (1)(b), must be fulfilled before the Relevant Person undertakes any Transaction on behalf of the customer or when undertaking an occasional transaction under \\u200e8.1.1(1)(b).\\n(b)\\tthe Relevant Person does not have to fulfil the verification of the identity of a customer and Beneficial Owners obligations under the AML Rules before undertaking a Transaction for a customer or occasional transaction where it has, on reasonable grounds, established that:\\n(i)\\tthere is little risk of money laundering and that risk is effectively managed; and\\n(ii)\\tdoing so would interrupt or delay the normal course of business in respect of effecting the Transaction.\\n8.2.1.(2) (a)\\tA Relevant Person that is a DNFBP must fulfil the appropriate CDD and reporting obligations where applicable before the Relevant Person prepares for or carries out a Transaction or provision of a service in Rule \\u200e8.1.1(2)(a), (d), (e) or (f).\\n(b)\\tA Relevant Person that is a DNFBP as a result of carrying on one or more of the business activities referred to in Rule \\u200e8.1.1(2)(b) or (c) must fulfil the appropriate CDD and reporting obligations where applicable before the Relevant Person prepares for or carries out a transaction that includes a total cash payment of USD15,000 or more, whether in a single cash payment or multiple cash payments.\\n8.2.1.(3) The Relevant Person does not have to fulfil the verification of the identity of a customer and Beneficial Owners obligations under the AML Rules preparing for or carrying out a Transaction for its customer concerning those business activities referred to in Rule \\u200e8.1.1(2) where it has, on reasonable grounds, established that:\\n(i)\\tthere is little risk of money laundering and that risk is effectively managed; and\\n(ii)\\tdoing so would interrupt or delay the normal course of business in respect of effecting the Transaction.\\n8.2.1.(4) A Relevant Person that has relied on Rule \\u200e8.2.1(1)(b) or \\u200e8.2.1(3) must fulfil its CDD obligations as soon as practicable after effecting the Transaction.\\n8.2.1.(5) Where the Relevant Person, having relied on Rule \\u200e8.2.1(1)(b) or \\u200e8.2.1(3) is unable to complete the verification of the identity of a customer and any Beneficial Owners within twenty Business Days of effecting a Transaction or occasional transaction it must:\\n(a)\\tconsider the circumstances and determine whether to make an internal notification of suspicious activity to the MLRO under Rule \\u200e14.2.2;\\n(b)\\twhere it has determined that it is unnecessary to make such a report, return to the customer any monies associated with the Transaction or occasional transaction, excluding any reasonable costs incurred by the Relevant Person;\\n(c)\\twhere it has determined that it is necessary to make such a report, not return any monies or provide any investments to the customer, unless instructed to do so by the MLRO and otherwise act in accordance with instructions issued by the MLRO; and\\n(d)\\tnot establish any further business relationship with that customer until the verification process has been completed for that customer in accordance with these Rules.\\n8.2.2\\n8.2.2.(1) A Relevant Person must ensure that its AML/TFS systems and controls referred to in Rule \\u200e6.2.1 include risk management policies and procedures concerning the conditions under which business relationships may be established with a customer before completing verification of the identity of a customer and Beneficial Owners.\\n8.2.2.Guidance\\n8.2.2.Guidance.1. Examples of situations that might lead a Relevant Person to have doubts about the veracity or adequacy of documents, data or information previously obtained might be where: there is a suspicion of money laundering in relation to that customer; there is a material change in the way that the customer\\'s account is operated which is not consistent with the customer\\'s business profile; or it appears to the Relevant Person that a Person other than the nominal customer is the real customer.\\n8.2.2.Guidance.2. Situations that the Relevant Person may take into account include, for example, accepting subscription monies during a short offer period or executing a time critical Transaction which, if not executed immediately, would or may cause a customer to incur a financial loss due to price movement or loss of opportunity or when a customer seeks immediate insurance cover.\\n8.2.2.Guidance.3. When complying with Rule \\u200e8.2.1, a Relevant Person should also, where relevant, consider Rule \\u200e8.7.1 regarding failure to conduct or complete CDD and Chapter \\u200e\\u200e14 regarding Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports and tipping off.\\n8.3 Customer Due Diligence requirements\\n8.3.1\\n8.3.1.(1) In undertaking CDD a Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tidentify the customer and verify the customer’s identity including identification and verification of the identity of any Person purporting to act on behalf of the customer;\\n(b)\\tidentify all the Beneficial Owners and take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the Beneficial Owners, such that the Relevant Person is satisfied that it knows who the Beneficial Owners are;\\n(c)\\tassess and understand and, as appropriate, obtain information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship; and\\n(d)\\tconduct ongoing due diligence of the business relationship as required under Rule \\u200e\\u200e8.6.1.\\n8.3.1.(2) In addition to complying with \\u200e(a), for life insurance or other similar policies a Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\trecord the names of any beneficiaries named in the policy;\\n(b)\\tverify the identity of all Persons in all classes of beneficiaries when a payout of the policy is due;\\n(c)\\tundertake the measures referred to in (a) and (b) as soon as the beneficiary of the policy is identified or designated; and\\n(d)\\tverify the identity of beneficiaries and any Beneficial Owners of a beneficiary before it makes a payout under the policy.\\n8.3.1.(3) A Relevant Person must have systems and controls in place and take reasonable measures to determine whether:\\n(a)\\ta customer,\\n(b)\\tany Beneficial Owners of the customer; or\\n(c)\\tfor a life insurance or other similar policy, any beneficiary of the policy, or any Beneficial Owners of a beneficiary;\\nis a PEP.\\n8.3.1.(4) If a PEP is identified under (3), then the Relevant Person must, in addition to CDD under \\u200e8.3.1, undertake Enhanced CDD under \\u200e8.4.1.\\n8.3.2\\n8.3.2.(1) For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(a), a Relevant Person must identify a customer and verify the customer’s identity in accordance with this Rule.\\n8.3.2.(2) If a customer is a Natural Person, a Relevant Person must obtain and verify information about the person’s:\\n(a)\\tfull name (including any alias);\\n(b)\\tdate of birth;\\n(c)\\tnationality;\\n(d)\\tlegal domicile; and\\n(e)\\tcurrent residential address, other than a post office box.\\n8.3.2.(3) If a customer is a Body Corporate, the Relevant Person must obtain and verify:\\n(a)\\tthe full name of the Body Corporate and any trading name;\\n(b)\\tthe address of its registered office and, if different, its principal place of business;\\n(c)\\tthe date and place of incorporation or registration;\\n(d)\\trelevant corporate documents of the customer; and\\n(e)\\tthe full names of the members of its Governing Body and persons exercising a senior management position.\\n8.3.2.(4) If a customer is a foundation, the Relevant Person must obtain and verify:\\n(a)\\ta certified copy of the charter and by-laws of the foundation or any other documents constituting the foundation; and\\n(b)\\tdocumentary evidence of the appointment of the guardian or any other person who may exercise powers in respect of the foundation.\\n8.3.2.(5) If a customer is a trust or other similar Legal Arrangement, the Relevant Person must obtain and verify:\\n(a)\\ta certified copy of the trust deed or other documents that set out the nature, purpose and terms of the trust or arrangement; and\\n(b)\\tdocumentary evidence of the appointment of the trustee or any other person exercising powers under the trust or arrangement.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.1. The information required under \\u200e8.3.2(2)(a) and (b) should be obtained through a review of an original current, valid passport or, where a customer does not own a passport, an official identification document which includes a photograph. For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.2(2)(a) and (b) an official government identification document in digital form and issued by a governmental competent authority is considered valid.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.2. A Relevant Person should ensure that any documents used for the purpose of identification are original documents, whichever format they are in, including digital.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.3. The verification of a customer’s identity, including their address, should be based on official documents. Where that is not possible, a Relevant Person should consider using additional documents or information obtained from different independent sources to verify identity. Any lack of official documents and alternative means of verification should lead the Relevant Person to re-assess the customer’s risk classification and the associated level of due diligence to be undertaken.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.4. For residents of the U.A.E., the UAE Pass may be used to identify and verify the identity of a customer who is a Natural Person, and thereby satisfy the requirement to verify the address of that customer only where the UAE Pass is duly authenticated by the Relevant Person.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.5. The Relevant Person must always verify the address of a customer subject to Enhanced Customer Due Diligence under Rule \\u200e8.4.1.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.6. Where personal identity documents, such as a passport, identity card or other identification documentation cannot be reviewed in original form, the identification documentation provided should be certified as a true copy of the original document by any one of the following:\\n(a)\\ta registered lawyer;\\n(b)\\ta registered notary;\\n(c)\\ta chartered accountant;\\n(d)\\ta government ministry;\\n(e)\\ta post office;\\n(f)\\ta police officer; or\\n(g)\\tan embassy or consulate.\\nThe individual or authority undertaking the certification should be contactable if necessary.\\nWhere a copy of an original identification document is made by a Relevant Person, the copy should be dated, signed and marked with \\'original sighted\\'.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.7. In complying with Rule \\u200e8.3.2(2), a Relevant Person should take reasonable steps to identify whether a customer has more than one nationality or residency rights in jurisdictions other than their jurisdiction of birth. The existence of such residency rights or dual nationality may be a potential risk factor and should be considered as such in the customer risk assessment required by Rule \\u200e7.1.1(3) and Rule \\u200e7.1.2.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.8. Where a Relevant Person uses eKYC for CDD purposes appropriate measures must be adopted to mitigate the risks that may arise from eKYC processes and the use of an eKYC System. A Relevant Person must ensure that eKYC is secure and effective, includes an appropriate combination of authentication factors when verifying the identity of the customer and ensure it is at least as stringent as face-to-face CDD. Measures should be in place to verify the authenticity of any official government identification document and the actual customer. A Relevant Person should also apply guidance on technical standards for biometric authentication issued by the Regulator or a competent authority of the U.A.E., as applicable.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.9. When employing an eKYC System to assist with CDD, a Relevant Person should:\\na.\\tensure that it has a thorough understanding of the eKYC System itself and the risks of eKYC, including those outlined by relevant guidance from FATF and other international standard setting bodies;\\nb.\\tcomply with all the Rules of the Regulator relevant to eKYC including, but not limited to, applicable requirements regarding the business risk assessment, as per Rule \\u200e6.1, and outsourcing, as per Rule \\u200e9.3;\\nc.\\tcombine eKYC with transaction monitoring, anti-fraud and cyber-security measures to support a wider framework preventing applicable Financial Crime; and\\nd.\\ttake appropriate steps to identify, assess and mitigate the risk of the eKYC system being misused for the purposes of Financial Crime.\\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.10. In undertaking CDD, a Relevant Person that is a Recognised Body should have regard to the provisions of the Market Infrastructure Rulebook (“MIR”) requiring appropriate measures be taken to prevent money laundering, Market Abuse and Financial Crime, including those set out at MIR 2.8.5(c) and MIR 2.9.\\n8.3.3\\n8.3.3.(1) For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(b), and subject to (4), a Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of a Body Corporate in accordance with this Rule.\\n8.3.3.(2) The Relevant Person must identify any Natural Person who:\\n(a)\\towns or controls (in each case whether directly or indirectly) 25% or more of the shares or voting rights in the Body Corporate;\\n(b)\\tcontrols the Body Corporate; or\\n(c)\\texercises ultimate control over the management of the Body Corporate.\\n8.3.3.(3) For the purposes of (2)(b), a Natural Person controls a Body Corporate if such person:\\n(a)\\tholds, directly or indirectly:\\n(i)\\t25% or more of the Body Corporate’s shares;\\n(ii)\\t25% or more of the voting rights in the Body Corporate; or\\n(iii)\\tthe right to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors of the Body Corporate; or\\n(b)\\thas the right to exercise, or actually exercises, significant influence or control over the Body Corporate.\\n8.3.3.(4) A Relevant Person is not required to comply with Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(b) if the customer is:\\n(a)\\ta Listed Body Corporate; or\\n(b)\\ta Body Corporate that is wholly-owned by the Federal Government of the U.A.E., or by any of the governments of the member Emirates of the U.A.E.; or\\n(c)\\ta Body Corporate created by Emiri decree within the U.A.E.\\n8.3.4\\n8.3.4.(1) For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(b), a Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of a Partnership in accordance with this Rule.\\n8.3.4.(2) The Relevant Person must identify any Natural Person who:\\n(a)\\tultimately is entitled to or controls (in each case whether directly or indirectly) a 25% or more share of the capital or profits of the Partnership or 25% or more of the voting rights in the Partnership; or\\n(b)\\totherwise exercises ultimate control over the management of the Partnership.\\n8.3.5\\n8.3.5.(1) For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(b), a Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of a customer that is a trustee of a trust or an equivalent position in respect of a similar Legal Arrangement in accordance with this Rule.\\n8.3.5.(2) The Relevant Person must identify:\\n(a)\\tthe settlor of the trust;\\n(b)\\tany other trustee(s) aside from the customer;\\n(c)\\teach beneficiary of the trust;\\n(d)\\twhere the persons or some of the persons benefiting from the trust have not been determined, the class of persons in whose main interest, in the opinion of the Registrar, the trust has been established or operates; and\\n(e)\\tany Natural Person who has control over the trust.\\n8.3.5.(3) For the purposes of (2)(e) “control” means a power, whether exercisable alone, jointly with another person or with the consent of another person, under the trust instrument or by law to:\\n(a)\\tdispose of, advance, lend, invest, pay or apply trust property;\\n(b)\\tvary or terminate the trust;\\n(c)\\tadd or remove a person as a beneficiary to or from a class of beneficiaries;\\n(d)\\tappoint or remove trustees or give another person control over the trust; and\\n(e)\\tdirect, withhold consent to or veto the exercise of a power mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d).\\n8.3.5.(4) Where any of the persons identified under (2)(a) to (e) are fulfilled by a Body Corporate or Partnership, the Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of Body Corporate or Partnership in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.3.3 and Rule \\u200e8.3.4.\\n8.3.6\\n8.3.6.(1) For the purposes of Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(b), a Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of a customer that is a foundation or other Legal Arrangement similar to a foundation in accordance with this Rule.\\n8.3.6.(2) The Relevant Person must identify:\\n(a)\\tthe founder;\\n(b)\\tthe foundation council members, or otherwise members of the governing body of the foundation;\\n(c)\\tthe guardian, if any;\\n(d)\\tthe beneficiaries, if named, or designee if no beneficiaries are named, in whose main interest, in the opinion of the Relevant Person, the foundation or arrangement has been established or operates; and\\n(e)\\tany Natural Person who has control over the foundation or other Legal Arrangement.\\n8.3.6.(3) For the purposes of (2)(e), a Natural Person shall have “control” over a foundation or a Legal Arrangement if such person:\\n(a)\\tholds, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the voting rights in the conduct and management of the foundation or the Legal Arrangement; or\\n(b)\\tholds the right, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove a majority of the officials of the foundation or the Legal Arrangement.\\n8.3.6.(4) Where any of the persons identified under (2)(a) to (d) are a Body Corporate or Partnership, the Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of Body Corporate or Partnership in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.3.3 and Rule \\u200e8.3.4.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on verification of the identity of Beneficial Owners\\n8.3.6.Guidance on verification of the identity of Beneficial Owners.1. In determining whether an individual meets the definition of Beneficial Owners regard should be had to all the circumstances of the case, in particular the size of an individual\\'s legal engagement or beneficial ownership in a Transaction.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on verification of the identity of Beneficial Owners.2. For a retail investment fund that is widely-held and where the investors invest via pension contributions, the Regulator would not expect the manager of the fund to look through to any underlying investors where there are none with any material control or ownership of the fund. However, for a closely-held fund with a small number of investors, each having a large shareholding or other interest, the Regulator would expect a Relevant Person to identify and verify each of the Beneficial Owners, depending on the risks identified as part of its risk-based assessment of the customer. For a corporate health policy with defined benefits, however, the Regulator would not expect a Relevant Person to identify the Beneficial Owners.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on verification of the identity of Beneficial Owners.3. An eKYC System may be used as part of the identification and verification of Beneficial Owners. When determining whether to use an eKYC System to assist in the CDD of a Beneficial Owner, a Relevant Person should establish if the eKYC System used allows it to comply fully with the relevant Rules in relation to CDD.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.1. Individuals who have, or have had, a high political profile, or hold, or have held, public office, may pose a higher money laundering risks to a Relevant Person as their position may make them prone to corruption. This risk also extends to members of their families and to known close associates. Being a PEP does not, in itself, of course, incriminate individuals or entities.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.2. Generally, a foreign PEP presents a higher risk of money laundering because there is a greater risk that such a Person, if he were undertaking money laundering, would attempt to place his money offshore, away from his home jurisdiction, where he is less likely to be recognised as a PEP and where it would be more difficult for law enforcement agencies in his home jurisdiction to confiscate or freeze his criminal proceeds.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.3. A Relevant Person should be aware that customer relationships with family members or close associates of PEPs involve similar risks to those with PEPs themselves.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.4. The risk of corruption-related money laundering increases where a Relevant Person deals with a PEP. Corruption may involve serious crimes and has become the subject of increasing global concern. Corruption offences are predicate crimes under Federal AML Legislation.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.5. The Regulator considers that after leaving office a PEP remains a higher risk for money laundering if such an individual continues to exert political influence or otherwise poses a risk of being involved in corruption.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.6. The fact that an individual is a PEP does not automatically mean that the individual must be assessed to be a high-risk customer: however, Enhanced CDD still needs to be undertaken on PEPs. A Relevant Person will need to assess the particular circumstances relating to each PEP to determine what risk category is appropriate.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on FATF Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring / Subject to a Call for Action\\n8.3.6.Guidance on FATF Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring / Subject to a Call for Action.1. A Relevant Person should maintain up-to-date lists of Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring and Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action and screen against them for potential exposure as part of CDD. Customer exposure to jurisdictions appearing on these lists should be taken into account when developing and applying risk-based measures relating to CDD. Customers exposed to such jurisdictions may present higher money laundering risks and specific counter-measures including Enhanced CDD may be required.\\n8.4 Enhanced Customer Due Diligence\\n8.4.1 Where a Relevant Person is required to undertake Enhanced CDD, having assigned a customer a high-risk rating or it or its Beneficial Owners is a PEP, then, in addition to CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.1, it must:\\n(a)\\tobtain:\\n(i)\\tadditional identification information on the customer and all Beneficial Owners;\\n(ii)\\tadditional information on the intended nature of the business relationship;\\n(iii)\\tinformation on the reasons for a Transaction;\\n(b)\\tupdate the CDD information which it holds on the customer and any Beneficial Owners more regularly;\\n(c)\\tidentify and verify:\\n(i)\\tthe Source of Funds; and\\n(ii)\\tthe Source of Wealth;\\nof the customer and, if applicable, all Beneficial Owners;\\n(d)\\tconduct enhanced monitoring of the business relationship, by increasing the frequency and intensity of controls applied, and determining which groups of transactions need further examination;\\n(e)\\tobtain the approval of Senior Management to commence a business relationship with the customer;\\n(f)\\trequire the first payment to be carried out through an account in the customer’s name with a financial institution that is subject to AML/TFS regulation and supervision in a jurisdiction that has standards equivalent to those set out in the FATF Recommendations; and\\n(g)\\tfor a customer who is a Natural Person, verify the current residential address (other than a post office box).\\n8.4.1.Guidance\\n8.4.1.Guidance.1. In Rule \\u200e8.4.1, Enhanced CDD measures are mandatory to the extent that they are applicable to the relevant customer or the circumstances of the business relationship and to the extent that the risks would reasonably require it. Therefore, the extent of additional measures to be conducted is a matter for the Relevant Person to determine on a case-by-case basis.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.2. In Rule \\u200e8.4.1(e), Senior Management approval may be given by an individual member of the Relevant Person\\'s Senior Management or by a committee of senior managers appointed to consider high-risk customers. Such approval may also be outsourced within the Group, but only to a suitably qualified individual or committee.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.3. For high-risk customers, a Relevant Person should, in order to mitigate the perceived potential and actual risks, exercise a greater degree of diligence throughout the course of the customer relationship and should endeavour to understand the nature of the customer\\'s business and consider whether it is consistent and reasonable.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.4. A Relevant Person should be satisfied that a customer\\'s use of complex legal structures and/or the use of trust and private investment vehicles, has a genuine and legitimate purpose.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.5. For Enhanced CDD, where there are one or more Beneficial Owners, verification of the customer\\'s Source of Funds and Wealth may require enquiring into the Beneficial Owners’ Source of Funds and Wealth because the Source of the Funds would normally be associated with the Beneficial Owners and not the customer.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.6. The Regulator considers that verification of Source of Funds includes obtaining independent corroborating evidence such as the proof of dividend payments connected to a shareholding, bank statements, salary/bonus certificates, loan documentation and proof of all Transactions which gave rise to payments into the account. A customer should be able to demonstrate and have documented how the relevant funds are connected to a particular event which gave rise to the payment into the account or to the source of the funds for a Transaction.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.7. The Regulator considers that verification of Source of Wealth includes obtaining independent corroborating evidence such as share certificates, publicly available registers of ownership, bank or brokerage account statements, probate documents, audited accounts and financial statements, news items from a reputable source and other similar evidence.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.8. A Relevant Person may commission a report from a third-party vendor to obtain further information on a customer or Transaction or to investigate a customer or Beneficial Owners in very high-risk cases. Such a report may be particularly useful where there is little or no publicly available information on a Person or on a Legal Arrangement or where the Relevant Person has difficulty in obtaining and verifying information.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.9. For Rule \\u200e8.4.1, circumstances where it may be applicable to require the first payment made by a customer in order to open an account with a Relevant Person to be carried out through a bank account in the customer\\'s name include:\\n(a)\\twhere, following the use of other Enhanced Customer Due Diligence measures, the Relevant Person is not satisfied with the results of that due diligence; or\\n(b)\\tas an alternative measure, where one of the measures in Rule \\u200e8.4.1(a) to (e) cannot be carried out.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.10. A Relevant Person should maintain up-to-date lists of Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring and Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action and take these lists into account in developing and applying risk-based measures relating to CDD including the development of compliance procedures.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.11. CDD should include screening for customer exposure to Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring and Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action. Customer exposure to such jurisdictions may present higher money laundering risks and specific risk-based countermeasures may be required. In the case of customer exposure to Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring, this may include undertaking Enhanced CDD. In the case of customer exposure to Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action, Enhanced CDD should always be undertaken.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.12. Pursuant to directives of the NAMLCFTC, Relevant Persons must exercise appropriate levels of due diligence on Transactions originating from, routed through or destined for Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action and any other financial or non-financial engagement involving an individual or entity from such jurisdictions.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.13. Relevant Persons should ensure they are aware of and comply with the requirements of the FIU relating to the filing of a High Risk Country Transaction Report or a High Risk Country Activity Report (as applicable) via goAML. Currently, these must be filed prior to conducting Transactions where the remitter or the beneficiary is an individual or entity associated with a Jurisdiction Subject to a Call for Action. Such Transactions may only be executed in line with guidance issued by the FIU.\\n8.5 Simplified Customer Due Diligence\\n8.5.1\\n8.5.1.(1) Where a Relevant Person is permitted to undertake Simplified CDD under Rule \\u200e8.1.1(4), modification of Rule \\u200e8.3.1 may include:\\n(a)\\tverifying the identity of the customer and any Beneficial Owners after the establishment of the business relationship;\\n(b)\\tdeciding to reduce the frequency of, or as appropriate not undertake, customer identification updates;\\n(c)\\tdeciding not to verify an identification document other than by requesting a copy;\\n(d)\\treducing the degree of ongoing monitoring of Transactions, based on a reasonable monetary threshold or on the nature of the Transaction; and\\n(e)\\tnot collecting specific information or carrying out specific measures to understand the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, but inferring such purpose and nature from the type of Transactions or business relationship established.\\n8.5.1.(2) The modification undertaken under (1) must be proportionate to the customer\\'s money laundering risks.\\n8.5.1.Guidance\\n8.5.1.Guidance.1. A Relevant Person should not use a \"one size fits all\" approach for all of its low-risk customers. Notwithstanding that the risks may be low for all such customers in that category, the extent of CDD undertaken needs to be proportionate to the specific risks identified on a case-by-case basis.\\n8.5.1.Guidance.2. A Relevant Person might reasonably reduce the frequency of or, as appropriate, eliminate customer identification updates where the money laundering risks are low and the service provided does not offer a realistic opportunity for money laundering.\\n8.5.1.Guidance.3. An example of where a Relevant Person might reasonably reduce the degree of ongoing monitoring and scrutinising of Transactions, based on a reasonable monetary threshold or on the nature of the Transaction, would be where the Transaction is a recurring, fixed contribution to a savings scheme, investment portfolio or fund or where the monetary value of the Transaction is not material for money laundering purposes given the nature of the customer and the Transaction type.\\n8.6 Ongoing Customer Due Diligence\\n8.6.1 When undertaking ongoing CDD under Rule \\u200e8.3.1(1)(d), a Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tmonitor Transactions undertaken during the course of its customer relationship to ensure that the Transactions are consistent with the Relevant Person\\'s knowledge of the customer, his business and risk rating;\\n(b)\\tpay particular attention to any complex or unusually large Transactions or unusual patterns of Transactions that have no apparent or visible economic or legitimate purpose;\\n(c)\\tenquire into the background and purpose of the Transactions in (b);\\n(d)\\tperiodically review the adequacy of the CDD information it holds on customers and Beneficial Owners to ensure that the information is kept up to date, particularly for customers with a high-risk rating; and\\n(e)\\tperiodically review each customer to ensure that the risk rating assigned to a customer under Rule \\u200e7.1.1(1)(b) remains appropriate for the customer in light of the money laundering risks.\\n8.6.2 A Relevant Person must apply an intensified and ongoing monitoring programme with respect to higher risk Transactions and customers.\\n8.6.2.Guidance\\n8.6.2.Guidance.1. The customer identification process does not end at the time of establishing a business relationship with a customer or, where relevant, undertaking a specific transaction or business activity on behalf of a customer. Following the start of the customer relationship, a Relevant Person should ensure that all relevant evidence and information is kept up to date including, for example, the list of authorised signatories who can act on behalf of a corporate customer.\\n8.6.2.Guidance.2. In complying with Rule 8.6.1(d), a Relevant Person should undertake a periodic review to ensure that non-static customer identity documentation is accurate and up to date.  A Relevant Person is expected to ensure that the information and the evidence obtained from a customer is valid and has not expired, for example when obtaining copies of identification documentation such as a passport or identification card.  Examples of non-static identity documentation include passport number and residential/business address and, for a Legal Person, its share register or list of partners.\\n8.6.2.Guidance.3. A Relevant Person should undertake a review under Rule \\u200e8.6.1(d) and (e) particularly when:\\n(a)\\tthe Relevant Person changes its CDD documentation requirements;\\n(b)\\tan unusual Transaction with the customer is expected to take place;\\n(c)\\tthere is a material change in the business relationship with the customer; or\\n(d)\\tthere is a material change in the nature or ownership of the customer.\\n8.6.2.Guidance.4. The degree of the ongoing due diligence to be undertaken will depend on the customer risk assessment carried out under Rule \\u200e7.1.1.\\n8.6.2.Guidance.5. A Relevant Person\\'s Transaction monitoring policies, procedures, systems and controls, which may be implemented by manual or automated systems, or a combination thereof, are one of the most important aspects of effective CDD. Whether a Relevant Person should undertake the monitoring by means of a manual or computerised system, or both, will depend on a number of factors, including:\\n(a)\\tthe size and nature of the Relevant Person\\'s business and customer base; and\\n(b)\\tthe complexity and volume of customer Transactions.\\n8.6.3 A Relevant Person must review its customers, their businesses, and Transactions, against Sanctions Lists when complying with Rule \\u200e8.6.1(d).\\n8.7 Failure to conduct or complete Customer Due Diligence\\n8.7.1\\n8.7.1.(1) Where, in relation to a customer, a Relevant Person is unable to conduct or complete the requisite CDD in accordance with Rule \\u200e8.1.1 it must, where appropriate:\\n(a)\\tnot carry out a Transaction with or for the customer through a bank account or in cash;\\n(b)\\tnot open an account or otherwise provide a service;\\n(c)\\tnot otherwise establish a business relationship or carry out a Transaction;\\n(d)\\tterminate or suspend any existing business relationship with the customer;\\n(e)\\treturn any monies or assets received from the customer; and\\n(f)\\tconsider whether the inability to conduct or complete CDD necessitates the making of a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report under Rule \\u200e14.3.1(c).\\n8.7.1.(2) A Relevant Person is not obliged to comply with (1)(a) to (e) if:\\n(a)\\tto do so would amount to \"tipping off\" the customer, in breach of Federal AML Legislation; or\\n(b)\\tthe FIU directs the Relevant Person to act otherwise.\\n8.7.1.Guidance\\n8.7.1.Guidance.1. In complying with Rule \\u200e8.7.1(1) a Relevant Person should apply one or more of the measures in (a) to (f) as appropriate in the circumstances. Where CDD cannot be completed to a significant degree, it may be appropriate not to carry out a Transaction pending completion of CDD. Where CDD cannot be conducted, including where a material part of the CDD such as identifying and verifying Beneficial Owners cannot be undertaken, a Relevant Person should not establish a business relationship with the customer.\\n8.7.1.Guidance.2. A Relevant Person should note that Rule \\u200e8.7.1 applies to both existing and prospective customers. For prospective customers it may be appropriate for a Relevant Person to terminate the business relationship before a product or service is provided. However, for existing customers, while termination of the business relationship should not be ruled out, suspension may be more appropriate depending on the circumstances, whilst further investigations are carried out. Whichever course of action is taken, the Relevant Person should be careful not to tip off the customer.\\n8.7.1.Guidance.3. A Relevant Person should adopt the RBA in order to inform the appropriate level of CDD to be undertaken for existing customers. For example, if a Relevant Person considers that any of its existing customers (which may include customers that it migrates into the ADGM) have not been subject to CDD of a standard equivalent to that required by the AML Rulebook, it should adopt the RBA and take remedial action in a manner proportionate to the risks and within a reasonable period of time whilst complying with Rule \\u200e8.7.\\n8.8 Portability of Customer Due Diligence information\\n8.8.1\\n8.8.1.(1) A Relevant Person “A” that is an Authorised Person or a Recognised Body must provide another Relevant Person, “B”, that is an Authorised Person or a Recognised Body, at the request of B, with the Customer Due Diligence information for customers that has been collected by A under Rules \\u200e8.3 and \\u200e8.4, subject to:\\n(a)\\t\\tthose customers being customers of both A and B at the time that the request is made;\\n(b)\\tB obtaining the written consent of the customers to whom the request relates and providing A with that consent for the release of such information by A;\\n(c)\\t\\tthe request being made solely for the purposes of conducting Customer Due Diligence on the customers to whom the request relates; and\\n(d)\\tin the preceding twelve months B not having requested Customer Due Diligence information from A for the same customers to whom the request relates.\\n8.8.1.(2) Relevant Person A must also provide Relevant Person B with any other information relevant to CDD that has been provided to it by those customers.\\n8.8.2 Following a request made under Rule \\u200e8.8.1, A must transfer to B without undue delay all Customer Due Diligence information in its possession for those customers.\\n8.8.3 Relevant Person A must not charge B a fee for the provision of Customer Due Diligence information provided under Rule \\u200e8.8.1.\\n\\n\\n9. AML/TFS COMPLIANCE AND THIRD PARTIES\\n9.1 Reliance on a third party\\n9.1.1\\n9.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person may rely on the following third parties to conduct one or more of the elements of CDD on its behalf:\\n(a)\\tan Authorised Person or Recognised Body;\\n(b)\\ta law firm, notary, or other independent legal business, accounting firm, audit firm or insolvency practitioner or an equivalent Person in another jurisdiction;\\n(c)\\ta Financial Institution;\\n(d)\\ta member of the Relevant Person\\'s Group; or\\n(e)\\tother specialised utilities for the provision of outsourced AML/TFS services.\\n9.1.1.(2) In (1), a Relevant Person may rely on the information previously obtained by a third party which covers one or more elements of CDD.\\n9.1.1.(3) Where a Relevant Person seeks to rely on a Person in (1) it may only do so if and to the extent that:\\n(a)\\tit immediately obtains the necessary CDD information from the third party in (1);\\n(b)\\tit takes adequate steps to satisfy itself that certified copies of the documents used to undertake the relevant elements of CDD will be available from the third party on request without delay;\\n(c)\\tthe Person in (1)(b) to (d) is subject to regulation, including AML/TFS compliance requirements, by a Non-ADGM Financial Services Regulator or other competent authority in a country with AML/TFS regulations which are equivalent to the standards set out in the FATF Recommendations and it is supervised for compliance with such regulations;\\n(d)\\tthe Person in (1) has not relied on any exception from the requirement to conduct any relevant elements of CDD which the Relevant Person seeks to rely on; and\\n(e)\\tin relation to (2), the information is up to date.\\n9.1.1.(4) Where a Relevant Person relies on a member of its Group to conduct one or more of the elements of CDD on its behalf, such Group member need not meet the condition in (3)(c) if:\\n(a)\\tthe Group is subject to policies and requirements equivalent to FATF standards, either:\\n(i)\\twhere the Group applies and implements a Group-wide policy on CDD and record-keeping which is equivalent to the standards set by FATF; or\\n(ii)\\twhere the effective implementation of those CDD and record-keeping requirements and AML/TFS programmes are supervised at Group level by a Non-ADGM Financial Services Regulator or other competent authority in a jurisdiction with AML/TFS regulations that are equivalent to the standards set out in the FATF Recommendations;\\n(b)\\tno exception from identification obligations has been applied in the original identification process; and\\n(c)\\ta written statement is received from the introducing member of the Relevant Person\\'s Group confirming that:\\n(i)\\tthe customer has been identified in accordance with the relevant standards under (4)(a) and (b);\\n(ii)\\tany identification evidence can be accessed by the Relevant Person without delay; and\\n(iii)\\tthe identification evidence will be kept for at least six years.\\n9.1.1.(5) If a Relevant Person is not reasonably satisfied that a customer or Beneficial Owners has been identified and verified by a third party in a manner consistent with these Rules, the Relevant Person must immediately perform the CDD itself with respect to any deficiencies identified.\\n(6)\\tNotwithstanding the Relevant Person\\'s reliance on a Person in \\u200e9.1.1(1), the Relevant Person remains responsible for compliance with, and liable for any failure to meet the CDD requirements in the AML Rulebook.\\n9.1.2\\n9.1.2.(1) When assessing under Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3) or (4) if AML/TFS regulations in another jurisdiction are equivalent to FATF standards, a Relevant Person must take into account factors including, but not limited to:\\n(a)\\tmutual evaluations, assessment reports or follow-up reports published by FATF, the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD or other International Organisations;\\n(b)\\tmembership of FATF or other international or regional groups such as the MENAFATF or the Gulf Co-operation Council;\\n(c)\\tcontextual factors such as political stability or the level of corruption in the jurisdiction;\\n(d)\\tevidence of recent criticism of the jurisdiction, including in:\\n(i)\\tFATF advisory notices;\\n(ii)\\tpublic assessments of the jurisdiction’s AML/TFS regimes by organisations referred to in (a); or\\n(iii)\\treports by other relevant non-government organisations or specialist commercial organisations;\\n(e)\\twhether adequate arrangements exist for co-operation between the AML/TFS regulator in that jurisdiction and the Regulator.\\n9.1.2.(2) A Relevant Person making an assessment under (1) must rely only on sources of information that are reliable and up to date.\\n9.1.2.(3) A Relevant Person must keep adequate records of how it made its assessment, including the sources and materials considered.\\n9.1.2.Guidance\\n9.1.2.Guidance.1. In complying with Rule \\u200e\\u200e9.1.1(3)(a), \"immediately obtaining the necessary CDD information\" means obtaining all relevant CDD information, and not just basic information such as name and address. However, compliance can be achieved by having the information sent in an email or other appropriate means. For the avoidance of doubt, it does not necessarily require a Relevant Person to immediately obtain the underlying certified documents used by the third party to undertake its CDD because under Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3)(b), these need only be available on request without delay.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.2. The Regulator would expect a Relevant Person, in complying with Rule \\u200e\\u200e9.1.1(5), to fill any gaps in the CDD process as soon as it becomes aware that a customer or Beneficial Owners has not been identified and verified by the third party in a manner consistent with these Rules.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.3. If a Relevant Person acquires another business, either in whole or in substantial part, the Regulator would permit the Relevant Person to rely on the CDD conducted by the business it is acquiring, but would expect the Relevant Person to have done the following:\\n(a)\\tas part of its due diligence for the acquisition, to have taken a reasonable sample of the prospective customers to assess the quality of the CDD undertaken; and\\n(b)\\tto have undertaken CDD on all the customers to cover any deficiencies identified in (a) as soon as possible following the acquisition, prioritising high-risk customers.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.4. Where the legislative framework of a jurisdiction (such as secrecy or data protection legislation) prevents a Relevant Person from having access to CDD information upon request without delay as referred to in Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3)(b), the Relevant Person should undertake the relevant CDD itself and should not seek to rely on the relevant third party.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.5. If a Relevant Person relies on a third party located in a foreign jurisdiction to conduct one or more elements of CDD on its behalf, the Relevant Person must ensure that the foreign jurisdiction has AML/TFS regulations which are equivalent to the standards in the FATF Recommendations (see Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3)(c)).\\n9.1.2.Guidance.6. Relevant Persons should follow directives issued by the NAMLCFTC. For example, Relevant Persons are prohibited from using third parties located in Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action to perform CDD.\\n9.2 Business partner identification\\n9.2.1\\n9.2.1.(1) Prior to establishing the business relationship, a Relevant Person must establish and verify the identity of its business partners by obtaining sufficient and satisfactory evidence of the identity of any business partner it relies upon in carrying on its Regulated Activities.\\n(a)\\tA Relevant Person must maintain accurate and up-to-date information and conduct ongoing due diligence on its business partners, throughout the course of the business relationship.\\n(b)\\tIf at any time a Relevant Person becomes aware that it lacks sufficient information or documentation concerning a business partner\\'s identification, or develops a concern about the accuracy of its current information or documentation, it must promptly obtain appropriate material to verify such business partner\\'s identity.\\n9.2.1.(2) In the context of this Rule, a \\'business partner\\' includes:\\n(a)\\ta third party as specified in Rule \\u200e9.1.1(1);\\n(b)\\ta member of the Relevant Person\\'s Group;\\n(c)\\ta Correspondent Bank; or\\n(d)\\tany other service provider.\\n9.2.1.(3) A Relevant Person that establishes, operates or maintains a Correspondent Account for a Correspondent Banking Client must ensure that it has arrangements to:\\n(a)\\tconduct due diligence in respect of the opening of a Correspondent Account for a Correspondent Banking Client, including measures to identify:\\n(i)\\tits ownership and management structure;\\n(ii)\\tits major business activities and customer base;\\n(iii)\\tits location; and\\n(iv)\\tthe intended purpose of the Correspondent Account;\\n(b)\\tidentify all third parties that will use the Correspondent Account; and\\n(c)\\tmonitor Transactions processed through a Correspondent Account that has been opened by a Correspondent Banking Client, in order to detect and report any suspicion of money laundering.\\n9.2.1.Guidance \\nUnder (2)(d), service providers include agents that directly facilitate the activities of Authorised Persons in servicing their clients, as distinct from other service providers that provide purely ancillary services, such as IT, facilities management etc. to an Authorised Person.\\n9.2.2 A Relevant Person must not:\\n9.2.2.(1) establish a correspondent banking relationship with a Shell Bank;\\n9.2.2.(2) establish or keep anonymous accounts or accounts in false names; or\\n9.2.2.(3) maintain a nominee account which is held in the name of one Person, but controlled by or held for the benefit of another Person whose identity has not been disclosed to the Relevant Person.\\n9.2.2.Guidance\\n9.2.2.Guidance.1. \"Know your business partner\" is as important as \"Know Your Customer\". A Relevant Person is therefore required to verify the identity of a prospective business partner and to obtain evidence of it. The same documentation that is used to identify customers should be obtained from the business partner prior to conducting any business.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.2. A Relevant Person should verify whether any secrecy or data protection law exists in the country of incorporation of the business partner that would prevent access to relevant data.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.3. The requirement to identify the business partner is meant to cover only those business partners who may pose any relevant money laundering risks to the Relevant Person. Hence, a Relevant Person would not be required to establish and verify the identity of, for example, its maintenance or cleaning service.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.4. The Regulator may take into account the identity of a Relevant Person\\'s business partner and the nature of their relationship in considering the fitness and propriety of a Relevant Person.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.5. Before entering into a business relationship, a Relevant Person should conduct a due diligence investigation, which includes ensuring that the business partner is an existing Person authorised to conduct the kind of business in question and, if applicable, verifying that this Person is duly regulated by a Financial Services Regulator or other relevant regulatory authority or regulator. In accordance with \"The Wolfsberg Anti-Money Laundering Principles for Correspondent Banking\", the Relevant Person should take into account, and verify the nature of:\\n(a)\\tthe business to be conducted and the major business activities of the business partner;\\n(b)\\tthe jurisdiction where the business partner is located as well as that of its parent; and\\n(c)\\tthe transparency and the nature of the ownership and the management structure.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.6. A Relevant Person may also gather information about the reputation of the business partner, including whether it has been subject to investigation or regulatory action in relation to money laundering.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.7. A Relevant Person should adopt a risk-based approach when verifying its business partners\\' identities. Depending on the money laundering risks assessment of the Relevant Person\\'s business partner, the Relevant Person should decide the level of detail of the business partner identification and verification process.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.8. A Relevant Person should have in place specific arrangements to ensure that adequate due diligence and identification measures with regard to the business relationship are taken.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.9. The Relevant Person should conduct regular reviews of the relationship with its business partners.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.10. The Senior Management or Governing Body of a Relevant Person should give its approval before it establishes any new correspondent banking relationships.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.11. A Relevant Person should also have arrangements to guard against establishing a business relationship with business partners who permit their accounts to be used by Shell Banks; further details on the definition of Shell Banks are set out in Guidance 2 to Rule \\u200e10.2.2.\\n9.3 Outsourcing and agents\\n9.3.1 A Relevant Person which outsources any one or more elements of its CDD to a service provider (including those within its Group) remains responsible for compliance with, and liable for any failure to meet, such obligations.\\n9.3.1A Prior to appointing a service provider to undertake CDD, a Relevant Person must undertake an initial assurance assessment to evaluate the suitability of the service provider and must ensure that the service provider\\'s obligations are clearly documented in a binding agreement.\\n9.3.1B After engaging a service provider the Relevant Person must undertake periodic assurance assessments to ensure that the services provided meet the obligations recorded in the binding agreement and allow it to meet all the requirements that it is subject to.\\n\\n9.3.1B.Guidance\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.1. The use by a Relevant Person of a service provider’s eKYC System that enables a Relevant Person to undertake eKYC constitutes outsourcing for the purposes of Rule \\u200e9.3.1.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.2. When undertaking an assurance assessment of an eKYC System for the purpose of Rule \\u200e9.3.1A, a Relevant Person should seek to establish that the eKYC System is reliable and independent, and allows the Relevant Person to comply with all applicable Rules of the Regulator. In addition, a Relevant Person should consider applying guidance on assurance standards issued by the Regulator, competent U.A.E. authorities, FATF, and other relevant standard setting bodies.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.3. In limited circumstances, a Relevant Person may place reliance on the assurance assessment of the eKYC System conducted entirely by another entity. Such circumstances comprise the following.\\n(a)\\tWhere an assurance assessment of the eKYC System has been undertaken by a Related entity and specifically addresses the Rules and Regulations applicable to the Relevant Person. In such circumstances, the Relevant Person remains responsible for the eKYC System’s compliance with applicable Rules and Laws and it should maintain a copy of the assessment.\\n(b)\\tWhere the eKYC System has been authorised by a competent authority of the U.A.E. or a competent authority in a jurisdiction with AML/TFS laws equivalent to the U.A.E. In such circumstances, the eKYC system should be authorised for use in CDD. Further, the Relevant Person should undertake its own review to ensure that any use of the relevant eKYC System is appropriate and enables compliance with all Rules and Regulations applicable to the Relevant Person.\\n(c)\\tWhere a Relevant Person chooses to employ a third party to assist in its own assurance assessment of the eKYC System, it should ensure that a competent and independent firm with relevant expertise and resources be employed. The Relevant Person remains wholly responsible for the eKYC System’s compliance with, and any failure to meet, the Rules and Regulations applicable to the Relevant Person.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.4. In complying with Rule \\u200e9.3.1, a Relevant Person should ensure that the service provider can be replaced with minimal disruption in the event the outsourcing arrangement is terminated.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.5. An Authorised Person is also required to comply with the outsourcing obligations in GEN 3.3.31 and 3.3.32 and PRU 6.8. A Recognised Body is also required to comply with the outsourcing obligations in MIR 2.14.\\n9.3.2 Authorised Persons Providing Money Services\\n9.3.2.(1) An Authorised Person that is engaged in Providing Money Services must:\\n(b)\\tmaintain a complete, current and accurate register of all agents and members of its Group it uses to conduct its operations and make that register available to the Regulator upon request;\\n(c)\\tinclude all agents and members of its Group identified in (a) as part of its AML/TFS compliance programme and monitor the compliance of such agents and members of its Group with the requirements of its AML/TFS programme;\\n(d)\\tcomply with all AML/TFS requirements imposed in all jurisdictions within which it operates and ensure the compliance of its agents and members of its Group operating on its behalf with all AML/TFS requirements in the jurisdictions in which they are operating;\\n(e)\\twhen executing a Payment Transaction, assess and consider all relevant information, including information about the Payer and the Payee, including any beneficiary as may be applicable, and require its agents and members of its Group, as appropriate, to determine whether a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report should be filed by it or its agents or a member of its Group; and\\n(f)\\twhere appropriate, ensure that the relevant equivalent of a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report is filed in all other jurisdictions related to a suspicious Payment Transaction and make available to all authorities responsible for AML/TFS compliance all transaction information related to the suspicious transaction.\\n9.3.2.(2) An Authorised Person making an assessment under (1) must rely upon current sources of information when making such assessment and must keep adequate records concerning such assessments, including all sources and materials considered, for a period of at least six years.\\n9.3.2.Guidance \\nAgents directly facilitate the activities of Authorised Persons in servicing their clients, as distinct from other service providers that provide purely ancillary services, such as IT, facilities management etc. to an Authorised Person.\\n\\n\\n10. CORRESPONDENT BANKING, WIRE TRANSFERS, ANONYMOUS ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT\\n10.1 Application\\n10.1.1 This Chapter applies to Recognised Bodies and all Authorised Persons, other than Credit Rating Agencies and Representative Offices.\\n10.2 Correspondent banking\\n10.2.1 An Authorised Person proposing to have a correspondent banking relationship with a respondent bank must:\\n(a)\\tundertake CDD on the respondent bank;\\n(b)\\tas part of (a), gather sufficient information about the respondent bank to understand fully the nature of the business, including making appropriate enquiries as to its management, its major business activities and the countries or jurisdictions in which it operates;\\n(c)\\tdetermine from publicly available information the reputation of the respondent bank and the quality of supervision that is subject to, including whether it has been the subject of a money laundering investigation or relevant regulatory action;\\n(d)\\tassess the respondent bank\\'s AML/TFS controls and ascertain if they are adequate and effective in light of the FATF Recommendations;\\n(e)\\tensure that prior approval of the Authorised Person\\'s Senior Management is obtained before entering into a new correspondent banking relationship;\\n(f)\\tensure that the respective responsibilities of the parties to the correspondent banking relationship are properly documented;\\n(g)\\tbe satisfied that, in respect of any customers of the respondent bank who have direct access to accounts of the Authorised Person, the respondent bank:\\n(i)\\thas undertaken CDD (including ongoing CDD) at least equivalent to that in Rule \\u200e8.3.1 in respect of each customer; and\\n(ii)\\tis able to provide the relevant CDD information in (i) to the Authorised Person upon request; and\\n(h)\\tdocument the basis for its satisfaction that the requirements in (a) to (g) are met.\\n10.2.2 An Authorised Person must:\\n(a)\\tnot enter into a correspondent banking relationship with a Shell Bank; and\\n(b)\\ttake appropriate measures to ensure that it does not enter into, or continue a corresponding banking relationship with, a bank which is known to permit its accounts to be used by Shell Banks.\\n10.2.2.Guidance\\n10.2.2.Guidance.1. The rules and guidance set out in Rule \\u200e9.2 above also apply to correspondent banking business partners. This Rule provides further details on specific requirements applicable to a correspondent banking business relationship.\\n10.2.2.Guidance.2. With regard to Correspondent Banking Clients and, if applicable, other qualified professionals, specific care should be taken to assess their AML/TFS arrangements regarding customer identification, Transaction monitoring, terrorist financing and other relevant elements, and to verify that these business partners comply with the same or equivalent AML/TFS requirements as the Relevant Person. Information on applicable laws and regulations regarding the prevention of money laundering should be obtained.\\n10.2.2.Guidance.3. A Relevant Person should ensure that a Correspondent Banking Client does not use the Relevant Person\\'s products and services to engage in business with Shell Banks. A Shell Bank would be a bank that has no physical presence in the country in which it is incorporated and licensed, and which is unaffiliated with a regulated financial Group that is subject to effective consolidated supervision. The Regulator does not consider that the existence of a local agent or low-level staff constitutes physical presence.\\n10.2.2.Guidance.4. If applicable, information on distribution networks and delegation of duties should be obtained.\\n10.3 Wire transfers and the Travel Rule\\n10.3.1 In this section:\\n(a)\\t“account” includes a digital wallet when the wire transfer is a transfer of Virtual Assets;\\n(b)\\t“account holder” includes a wallet holder when the wire transfer is a transfer of Virtual Assets;\\n(c)\\t“account number” includes a wallet address when the wire transfer is a transfer of Virtual Assets;\\n(d)\\t“batch transfer” means a transfer comprised of a number of individual wire transfers that are bundled for transmission, whether or not the individual wire transfers are intended ultimately for one or more beneficiaries;\\n(e)\\t\"beneficiary\" means the Natural or Legal Person or the Legal Arrangement that is identified by the originator as the receiver of the requested wire transfer;\\n(f)\\t\"originator\" means the account holder who instructs the wire transfer from the relevant account, or where there is no account, the Natural or Legal Person that places the order with the ordering Financial Institution to perform the wire transfer; and\\n(g)\\t\"wire transfer\" includes any value transfer arrangement.\\n10.3.2\\n10.3.2.(1) An Authorised Person and Recognised Body must:\\n(a)\\twhen it sends or receives a wire transfer on behalf of a customer, ensure that the wire transfer and any related messages contain accurate originator and beneficiary information;\\n(b)\\tensure that, while the wire transfer is under its control, the information in (a) remains with the wire transfer and any related message throughout the payment chain;\\n(c)\\tmonitor wire transfers for the purpose of detecting those wire transfers that do not contain both originator and beneficiary information and take appropriate measures to identify any money laundering risks; and\\n(d)\\tnot effect wire transfers without the information required under (3) and (4).\\n10.3.2.(2) The requirement in (1) does not apply to an Authorised Person or Recognised Body which:\\n(a)\\tprovides Financial Institutions with messages or other support systems for wire transfers; or\\n(b)\\tundertakes a wire transfer to another Financial Institution where both the originator and the beneficiary are Financial Institutions acting on their own behalf.\\n10.3.2.(3) An Authorised Person and Recognised Body must ensure that information accompanying all wire transfers contains at a minimum:\\n(a)\\tthe name of the originator;\\n(b)\\tthe originator account number where such an account is used to process the Transaction or a unique Transaction reference number if no originator account number exists;\\n(c)\\tthe originator\\'s address, or national identity number, or travel document number, or customer identification number, or date and place of birth;\\n(d)\\tthe name of the beneficiary; and\\n(e)\\tthe beneficiary account number where such an account is used to process the Transaction or a unique Transaction reference number if no beneficiary account number exists.\\n10.3.2.(4) An Authorised Person and Recognised Body must ensure that for batch transfers:\\n(a)\\tit has verified the originator information required under (3)(a) to (c); and\\n(b)\\tthe batch file contains the beneficiary information required under (3)(d) and (e) for each beneficiary and that the information is fully traceable in the beneficiaries jurisdiction.\\n10.3.2.Guidance\\n10.3.2.Guidance.1. \\'FATF Recommendation Number 16\\' seeks to ensure that national or international electronic payment and message systems, including fund or wire transfer systems such as SWIFT, are not misused as a means to break the money laundering audit trail. Therefore, the information about a customer as the originator of the wire transfer should remain with the payment instruction throughout the payment chain.\\n10.3.2.Guidance.2. Relevant Persons should monitor for, and conduct enhanced scrutiny of, suspicious activities, including incoming wire transfers that do not contain complete originator information, including name, address and account number or unique reference number.\\n10.3.2.Guidance.3. The Regulator considers that concealing or removing in a wire transfer any of the information required by Rule \\u200e10.3.2(3) would be a breach of the requirement to ensure that the wire transfer contains accurate originator and beneficiary information.\\n10.3.2.Guidance.4. The Regulator expects compliance by Authorised Persons and Recognised Bodies with ‘FATF Recommendation Number 15’, FATF’s Interpretative Note (R.15/INR.15) and ‘FATF Recommendation Number 16’ that include requirements to obtain, hold, and transmit originator and beneficiary information and to not allow transfers where such information is lacking including where the value transfer involves Virtual Assets. Authorised Persons and Recognised Bodies should note that, pursuant to section \\u200e10.3, the Regulator does not differentiate between the responsibilities of the originator or the beneficiary when it comes to ensuring that all relevant information accompanies a wire transfer, and that no de minimis threshold is applied to the size of a relevant wire transfer.\\n10.4 Audit\\n10.4.1 An Authorised Person or a Recognised Body must ensure that its internal audit function undertakes regular reviews and assessments of the effectiveness of the Authorised Person or Recognised Body\\'s money laundering policies, procedures, systems and controls, and its compliance with its obligations in the AML Rulebook.\\n10.4.1.Guidance\\n10.4.1.Guidance.1. The review and assessment undertaken for the purposes of Rule \\u200e10.4.1 may be undertaken:\\n(a)\\tinternally by the Authorised Person or Recognised Body\\'s internal audit function; or\\n(b)\\tby a competent firm of independent, external auditors or compliance professionals.\\n10.4.1.Guidance.2. The review and assessment undertaken for the purposes of Rule \\u200e10.4.1 should cover at least the following:\\n(a)\\tsample testing of compliance with the Authorised Person or the Recognised Body\\'s CDD arrangements;\\n(b)\\tan analysis of all notifications made to the MLRO to highlight any area where procedures or training may need to be enhanced; and\\n(c)\\ta review of the nature and frequency of the dialogue between Senior Management and the MLRO.\\n10.5 Anonymous and nominee accounts\\n10.5.1 An Authorised Person or a Recognised Body must not establish or maintain:\\n(a)\\tan anonymous account or an account in a fictitious name; or\\n(b)\\ta nominee account which is held in the name of one Person, but which is controlled by or held for the benefit of another Person whose identity has not been disclosed to the Authorised Person or the Recognised Body.\\n\\n11. TARGETED FINANCIAL SANCTIONS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS\\n11.1 Resolutions and Sanctions\\n11.1.1\\n11.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person must establish and maintain effective systems and controls to ensure that on an ongoing basis it is properly informed as to, and takes reasonable measures to comply with, relevant resolutions or Sanctions which it is required to comply with, under the laws of the ADGM or any other jurisdiction.\\n11.1.1.(2) A Relevant Person must immediately notify the Regulator when it becomes aware that it is, for or on behalf of a Person:\\n(a)\\tcarrying on or about to carry on an activity;\\n(b)\\tholding or about to hold money or other assets; or\\n(c)\\tundertaking or about to undertake any other business whether or not arising from or in connection with (a) or (b);\\nwhere such carrying on, holding or undertaking constitutes or may constitute a contravention of any Sanctions with which the Relevant Person is required to comply, under the laws of the ADGM or any other jurisdiction.\\n11.1.1.(3) A Relevant Person must ensure that the notification stipulated in (2) above includes the following information:\\n(a)\\ta description of the relevant activity in (2)(a), (b) or (c); and\\n(b)\\tthe action proposed to be taken or that has been taken by the Relevant Person with regard to the matters specified in the notification.\\n11.1.1.Guidance\\n11.1.1.Guidance.1. In Rule \\u200e11.1.1(1), taking reasonable measures to comply with resolutions or Sanctions may include, for example, a Relevant Person not undertaking a transaction for or on behalf of a Person without undertaking further due diligence in respect of that Person.\\n11.1.1.Guidance.2. Relevant resolutions or Sanctions mentioned in Rule \\u200e11.1.1 may, among other things, relate to money laundering, terrorist financing or the financing of WMD, or otherwise be relevant to the activities carried on by the Relevant Person. For example:\\n(a)\\ta Relevant Person should exercise due care to ensure that it does not provide services to, or otherwise conduct business with, a Person engaged in money laundering, terrorist financing or the financing of WMD; and\\n(b)\\ta Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House, as a Recognised Body, should additionally exercise due care to ensure that it does not facilitate fund raising activities or listings by Persons engaged in money laundering or terrorist financing or financing of WMD.\\n11.1.1.Guidance.3. A Relevant Person should be proactive in checking for, and taking measures to comply with, relevant resolutions or Sanctions which the Relevant Person is required to comply with, under the laws of the ADGM or any other jurisdiction. This should include measures that enable a Relevant Person to comply with their obligations under Federal AML Legislation. The Regulator expects Relevant Persons to perform checks on an ongoing basis against their customer databases and records for any names appearing in resolutions or Sanctions which the Relevant Person is required to comply with as well as to monitor transactions accordingly.\\n11.1.1.Guidance.4. A Relevant Person may use a database maintained elsewhere for an up-to-date list of resolutions and Sanctions, or to perform checks of customers or transactions against that list. For example, it may wish to use a database maintained by its head office or a Group member. However, the Relevant Person retains responsibility for ensuring that its systems and controls are effective to ensure compliance with this Rulebook.\\n11.1.1.Guidance.5. The systems and controls referred to in Rule \\u200e11.1.1(1) should enable a Relevant Person to comply with the requirements of Article 21 of Cabinet Decision No. (74) of 2020, which include:\\n(a)\\tRegistering on the EOCN website to receive updates on changes to Targeted Financial Sanctions lists.\\n(b)\\tRegularly screening its databases and transactions against Targeted Financial Sanctions lists as required by the screening scope and timings as set out in the Cabinet Decision.\\n(c)\\tImplementing freezing measures without delay or prior notice to the relevant Person(s) if a match is found as a result of the required screening.\\n(d)\\tLifting freezing measures without delay, where necessary.\\n(e)\\tNotifying appropriate regulatory authorities of any of the scenarios set out in the Cabinet Decision including confirmed or partial matches against Targeted Financial Sanctions lists.\\n(f)\\tEstablishing and implementing internal controls and procedures to ensure compliance with the Cabinet Decision.\\n(g)\\tCo-operating with the EOCN and relevant regulatory authorities.\\n11.1.1.Guidance.6. Relevant Persons should ensure they are fully aware of and in compliance with the requirements issued pursuant to Federal AML Legislation by the EOCN and other relevant authorities including the requirement to file PNMRs and FFRs as appropriate. Failure to do so, including failure to file a report relating to a confirmed or partial match with a Targeted Financial Sanctions list, may result in the Regulator taking appropriate action.\\n11.2 Government, regulatory and international findings\\n11.2.1\\n11.2.1.(1) A Relevant Person must establish and maintain systems and controls to ensure that on an ongoing basis it is properly informed as to, and takes reasonable measures to comply with, any findings, recommendations, guidance, directives, resolutions, Sanctions, notices or other conclusions issued by:\\n(a)\\tthe government of the U.A.E. or any government departments in the U.A.E.;\\n(b)\\tthe Central Bank of the U.A.E.;\\n(c)\\tthe FIU;\\n(d)\\tthe EOCN;\\n(e)\\tthe NAMLCFTC;\\n(f)\\tU.A.E. enforcement agencies;\\n(g)\\tthe UNSC;\\n(h)\\tFATF;\\n(i)\\tthe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision;\\n(j)\\tthe Regulator; and\\n(k)\\tany other jurisdiction which promulgates Sanctions to which it is subject,\\nconcerning the matters in (2).\\n11.2.1.(2) For the purposes of (1), the relevant matters are:\\n(a)\\tarrangements for preventing money laundering, terrorist financing or the financing of weapons of mass destruction in a particular country or jurisdiction, including any assessment of material deficiency in adopting international standards against a relevant country or jurisdiction; and\\n(b)\\tthe names of Persons, groups, organisations or entities or any other body where suspicion of money laundering exists.\\n11.2.1.(3) For the purposes of (1), measures that a Relevant Person must undertake when taking reasonable measures to comply with findings, recommendations, guidance, directives, resolutions, Sanctions, notices or other conclusions, include, but are not limited to, countermeasures:\\n(a)\\trequiring specific elements of enhanced CDD;\\n(b)\\trequiring enhanced reporting mechanisms or systematic reporting of financial transactions;\\n(c)\\tlimiting business relationships or financial transactions with specified persons or persons in a specified jurisdiction;\\n(d)\\tprohibiting Relevant Persons from relying on third parties located in a specified jurisdiction to conduct CDD;\\n(e)\\trequiring the review and amendment, or if necessary termination, of correspondent relationships with banks in a specified jurisdiction;\\n(f)\\tprohibiting the execution of specified electronic fund transfers; or\\n(g)\\trequiring increased external audit requirements for financial groups with respect to any of their branches and subsidiaries located in a specified jurisdiction.\\n11.2.1.(4) The systems and controls referred to in (1) must enable the Relevant Person to comply with the requirements of Article 21 of Cabinet Decision No. (74) of 2020.\\n11.2.1.(5) A Relevant Person must immediately notify the Regulator in writing if it becomes aware of non-compliance by a Person with a finding, recommendation, guidance, directive, resolution, Sanction, notice or other conclusion and provide the Regulator with sufficient details of the Person concerned and the nature of the non-compliance.\\n11.2.1.Guidance\\n11.2.1.Guidance.1. The purpose of this Rule is to ensure that a Relevant Person takes into consideration the broad range of tools used by competent authorities and international organisations to communicate AML/TFS risks to stakeholders.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.2. The Regulator may require enhanced CDD or other specific countermeasures to address risks identified in a specific country or jurisdiction. The Regulator may impose such countermeasures either when called upon to do so by FATF or independently of any FATF request.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.3. Relevant Persons considering Transactions or business relationships with Persons located in countries or jurisdictions that have been identified as deficient, or against which the U.A.E. or the Regulator have outstanding advisories, should be aware of the background against which the assessments or the specific recommendations have been made. These circumstances should be taken into account in respect of business introduced from such jurisdictions, and when receiving inward payments for existing customers or in respect of inter-bank transactions. The NAMLCFTC website provides information concerning national AML/TFS initiatives, including countermeasures for high-risk countries and updates on developments for high-risk countries.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.4. The Relevant Person\\'s MLRO is not obliged to report all Transactions from these countries or jurisdictions to the FIU if they do not qualify as suspicious under Federal AML Legislation (see Chapter \\u200e14 on Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports) unless otherwise instructed to do so by the NAMLCFTC.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.5. Transactions with counterparties located in countries or jurisdictions which are no longer identified as deficient or have been relieved from special scrutiny (for example, taken off sources mentioned in this Guidance) may nevertheless require attention which is higher than normal.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.6. In order to assist Relevant Persons, the Regulator may publish findings, guidance, directives or Sanctions from U.A.E. authorities, the FATF or other relevant bodies. However, the Regulator expects a Relevant Person to take its own steps in acquiring relevant information from various available sources. For example, a Relevant Person may obtain relevant information from consolidated lists of financial Sanctions published by the European Union, HM Treasury, and OFAC.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.7. In addition, the systems and controls mentioned in Rule \\u200e11.2.1 should be established and maintained by a Relevant Person taking into account its risk assessment under Chapters \\u200e6 and \\u200e7. In relation to the term \"make appropriate use\" in Rule \\u200e11.2.1, this may mean that a Relevant Person cannot undertake a Transaction for or on behalf of a Person or that it may need to undertake further due diligence in respect of such a Person.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.8. A Relevant Person should be proactive in obtaining and appropriately using available national and international information, for example, suspect lists or databases from credible public or private sources with regard to money laundering, including obtaining relevant information from sources mentioned in Guidance 6 above. The Regulator encourages Relevant Persons to perform checks against their customer databases and records for any names appearing on such lists and databases as well as to monitor Transactions accordingly.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.9. The risk of terrorists entering the financial system can be reduced if Relevant Persons apply effective AML/TFS strategies, particularly with respect to CDD. Relevant Persons should assess which countries carry the highest risks and should conduct an analysis of Transactions from countries or jurisdictions known to be a source of terrorist financing.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.10. The Regulator may require Relevant Persons to take any special measures it may prescribe with respect to certain types of Transactions or accounts where the Regulator reasonably believes that any of the above may pose a money laundering risks to the ADGM.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.11. Relevant Persons are required to have arrangements in place to ensure the ability to comply with all applicable Sanctions in relation to physical delivery of commodities including Spot Commodities.\\n11.2.1.Guidance.12. Relevant Persons are reminded that the U.A.E. has regulations in place relating to controls on the export and import of dual-use goods. Relevant Persons should ensure they are in compliance with such regulations. The EOCN makes a list of dual-use goods that are subject to export and import controls available on its website.\\n\\n\\n12. MONEY LAUNDERING REPORTING OFFICER\\n12.1 Appointment of an MLRO\\n12.1.1\\n12.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person must appoint an individual as the MLRO who has an appropriate level of seniority, experience and independence to act in the role, with responsibility for implementation and oversight of its compliance with the Rules in the AML Rulebook. It must do so by completing and filing with the Regulator the appropriate form specified by the Regulator.\\n12.1.1.(2) The MLRO in (1) and Rule \\u200e12.1.7 must be resident in the U.A.E.\\n12.1.2 The individual appointed as the MLRO of a DNFBP that comprises of one officer, partner or principal can, with the prior approval of the Regulator be the same person as the officer, partner or principal of the DNFBP.\\n12.1.3 The individual appointed as the MLRO of a Representative Office must be the same individual who holds the position of Principal Representative of that Representative Office.\\n12.1.3.Guidance\\n12.1.3.Guidance.1. Authorised Persons are reminded that under GEN Rule 5.5.1 the MLRO function is a mandatory appointment. For the avoidance of doubt, the individual appointed as the MLRO of an Authorised Person, other than a Representative Office, is the same individual who holds the Controlled Function of MLRO of that Authorised Person. Authorised Persons are also reminded that the guidance under GEN Rule 5.5.2 sets out the grounds under which the Regulator will determine whether to grant a waiver from the residence requirements for an MLRO. The same guidance is relevant to other Relevant Persons seeking a waiver from the MLRO residence requirements.\\n12.1.3.Guidance.2. The individual appointed as the MLRO of a Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House is the same individual who holds the position of MLRO of that Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House under the relevant MIR Rule.\\n12.1.4 If the MLRO leaves the employment of the Relevant Person, the Relevant Person must immediately appoint a new MLRO or arrange temporary cover for the MLRO appointment.\\n12.1.5 A Relevant Person, other than a Representative Office, must appoint an individual to act as a deputy MLRO of the Relevant Person to fulfil the role of the MLRO in his absence.\\n12.1.6 A Relevant Person\\'s MLRO and deputy MLRO must deal with the Regulator in an open and co-operative manner and must disclose appropriately any information of which the Regulator would reasonably be expected to be notified.\\n12.1.6.Guidance\\n12.1.6.Guidance.1. The individual appointed as the deputy MLRO need not apply for the Regulator’s approval.\\n12.1.6.Guidance.2. A Relevant Person should make adequate arrangements to ensure that it remains in compliance with the AML Rulebook in the event that its MLRO is absent. Adequate arrangements would include appointing a temporary MLRO for the period of the MLRO\\'s absence or making sure that the Relevant Person\\'s AML/TFS systems and controls allow it to continue to comply with these Rules when the MLRO is absent.\\n12.1.7 A Relevant Person may outsource the role of MLRO to an individual outside the Relevant Person provided that the individual under the outsourcing agreement is and remains suitable to perform the MLRO role.\\n12.1.7.Guidance \\nWhere a Relevant Person outsources specific AML/TFS tasks of its MLRO to another individual or a third-party provider, including the case where they are within its corporate Group, the Relevant Person remains responsible for ensuring that the duties undertaken by the MLRO ensure its compliance with the requirements in the AML Rulebook. The Relevant Person should satisfy itself of the suitability of anyone who acts for it in the role of MLRO.\\n12.2 Qualities of an MLRO\\n12.2.1 A Relevant Person must ensure that its MLRO has:\\n(a)\\tdirect access to the Governing Body and its Senior Management;\\n(b)\\tsufficient and up-to-date qualifications and experience to fulfil the role;\\n(c)\\tsufficient resources including, if necessary, an appropriate number of appropriately trained Employees to assist in the performance of his duties in an effective, objective and independent manner;\\n(d)\\ta level of seniority and independence within the Relevant Person to enable him to act on his own authority;\\n(e)\\ttimely and unrestricted access to information the Relevant Person has about the financial and business circumstances of a customer or any Person on whose behalf the customer is or has been acting sufficient to enable him to carry out his responsibilities in accordance with Rule \\u200e12.3.1; and\\n(f)\\tunrestricted access to relevant information about the features of the Transaction which the Relevant Person has entered into or may have contemplated entering into with or for the customer or a Person on whose behalf a customer is or has been acting.\\n12.2.1.Guidance \\nThe Regulator considers that a Relevant Person will need to consider this Rule most especially when appointing an outsourced MLRO. Any external MLRO that is appointed will need to have the actual or effective level of seniority that the role requires.\\n12.3 Responsibilities of an MLRO\\n12.3.1 A Relevant Person must ensure that its MLRO implements and has oversight of and is responsible for the following matters:\\n(a)\\tthe day-to-day operations for compliance by the Relevant Person with its AML/TFS policies, procedures, systems and controls;\\n(b)\\tacting as the point of contact to receive internal notifications of suspicious activity from the Relevant Person\\'s Employees under Rule \\u200e14.2.2;\\n(c)\\ttaking appropriate action under Rule \\u200e14.3.1 following receipt of a notification from an Employee;\\n(d)\\tmaking, in accordance with Federal AML Legislation, Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports;\\n(e)\\tacting as the point of contact within the Relevant Person for competent U.A.E. authorities and the Regulator regarding money laundering issues;\\n(f)\\tresponding promptly to any request for information made by competent U.A.E. authorities or the Regulator;\\n(g)\\treceiving and acting upon any relevant findings, recommendations, guidance, directives, resolutions, Sanctions, notices or other conclusions described in Chapter \\u200e11; and\\n(h)\\testablishing and maintaining an appropriate money laundering training programme and adequate awareness arrangements under Chapter \\u200e13.\\n12.3.1.Guidance \\nDepending on the size, nature and complexity of the business and operations, Relevant Persons and MLROs should consider whether it is appropriate to screen prospective employees for money laundering risks prior to employment to ensure high standards when hiring.\\n12.4 Reporting\\n12.4.1 The MLRO must report semi-annually to the Governing Body or Senior Management of the Relevant Person on the following matters:\\n(a)\\tthe results of the review under Rule \\u200e4.1.1(4);\\n(b)\\tthe Relevant Person\\'s compliance with Federal AML Legislation and the Regulations and Rules of the Regulator (including this AML Rulebook);\\n(c)\\trelevant findings, recommendations, guidance, directives, resolutions, Sanctions, notices or other conclusions and how the Relevant Person has taken them into account;\\n(d)\\tinternal notification(s) of suspicious activity to the MLRO made under Rule \\u200e14.2.2 by the Relevant Person\\'s Employees, or its agents or members of its Group where acting on its behalf, and action taken in respect of those reports, including the grounds for all decisions;\\n(e)\\tSuspicious Activity/Transaction Reports made by the Relevant Person, or its agents or members of its Group where acting on its behalf,  and action taken in respect of those reports including the grounds for all decisions; and\\n(f)\\tother relevant matters related to AML/TFS as it concerns the Relevant Person\\'s business.\\n12.4.2 A Relevant Person must ensure that its Governing Body or Senior Management promptly:\\n(a)\\tassess the report provided under Rule \\u200e12.4.1;\\n(b)\\ttake action, as required, subsequent to consideration of the findings of the report, in order to resolve any identified deficiencies; and\\n(c)\\tmake a record of their assessment pursuant to paragraph (a) and the action taken pursuant to paragraph (b).\\n12.4.3 The Relevant Person must provide to the Regulator a copy of:\\n(a)\\tthe report provided under Rule \\u200e12.4.1; and\\n(b)\\tthe record made under Rule \\u200e12.4.2(c).\\n\\n\\n13. AML/TFS TRAINING AND AWARENESS\\n13.1 Training and awareness\\n13.1.1 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\tprovide AML/TFS training to all relevant Employees at appropriate and regular intervals;\\n(b)\\tensure that its AML/TFS training enables its Employees to:\\n(i)\\tknow the identity, and understand the responsibilities, of the Relevant Person\\'s MLRO and his deputy;\\n(ii)\\tunderstand the relevant legislation relating to money laundering including Federal AML Legislation;\\n(iii)\\tunderstand its policies, procedures, systems and controls related to money laundering and any changes to these;\\n(iv)\\trecognise and deal with Transactions, risks, trends, techniques and other activities which may be related to money laundering;\\n(v)\\tunderstand the types of activity that may constitute suspicious activity in the context of the business in which an Employee is engaged and that may warrant an internal notification of suspicious activity to the MLRO under Rule \\u200e14.2.2;\\n(vi)\\tunderstand its arrangements regarding the making of an internal notification to the MLRO of suspicious activity under Rule \\u200e14.2.2;\\n(vii)\\tbe aware of the prevailing techniques, methods and trends in money laundering relevant to the business of the Relevant Person;\\n(viii)\\tunderstand the roles and responsibilities of Employees in combatting money laundering; and\\n(ix)\\tunderstand the relevant findings, recommendations, guidance, directives, resolutions, Sanctions, notices or other conclusions described in Chapter \\u200e11;\\n(c)\\tensure that its AML/TFS training:\\n(i)\\tis appropriately tailored to the Relevant Person\\'s activities, including its products, services, customers, distribution channels, business partners and the level and complexity of its Transactions; and\\n(ii)\\tindicates the different levels of money laundering risks and vulnerabilities associated with the matters in (i); and\\n(d)\\tensure that its AML/TFS training is up to date with money laundering trends and techniques.\\n13.2 Frequency\\n13.2.1 A Relevant Person must provide AML/TFS training for all Employees in accordance with Rule \\u200e13.1.1 at least annually.\\n13.3 Record-keeping\\n13.3.1 All relevant details of the Relevant Person\\'s AML/TFS training must be recorded, including:\\n(a)\\tdates when the training was given;\\n(b)\\tthe nature of the training; and\\n(c)\\tthe names of the Employees who received the training.\\n13.3.2 These records must be kept for at least six years from the date on which the training was given.\\n13.3.2.Guidance\\n13.3.2.Guidance.1. The Regulator considers it appropriate that all new relevant Employees of a Relevant Person be given appropriate AML/TFS training as soon as reasonably practicable after commencing employment with the Relevant Person, and thereafter on a periodic basis.\\n13.3.2.Guidance.2. A relevant Employee would include a member of the Senior Management or operational staff, any Employee with customer contact or who handles or may handle customer monies or assets, and any other Employee who might otherwise encounter money laundering in the business.\\n13.3.2.Guidance.3. Relevant Persons should take an RBA to AML/TFS training. The Regulator considers that AML/TFS training should be provided by a Relevant Person to each of its relevant Employees at intervals appropriate to the role and responsibilities of the Employee. In the case of an Authorised Person the Regulator expects that training should be provided to each relevant Employee at least annually.\\n13.3.2.Guidance.4. The manner in which AML/TFS training is provided by a Relevant Person need not be in a formal classroom setting, rather it may be via an online course or any other similarly appropriate manner.\\n\\n\\n14. SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY/TRANSACTION REPORTS\\n14.1 Application and definitions\\nIn this Chapter \"money laundering\" and “terrorist financing\" means the criminal offences defined in Federal AML Legislation.\\n14.2 Internal reporting requirements\\n14.2.1 A Relevant Person must establish and maintain policies, procedures, systems and controls in order to monitor and detect suspicious activity or Transactions in relation to potential money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.2.2 A Relevant Person must have policies, procedures, systems and controls to ensure that whenever any Employee, acting in the ordinary course of his employment, either:\\n(a)\\tknows;\\n(b)\\tsuspects; or\\n(c)\\thas reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting,\\nthat a Person is engaged in or attempting money laundering or terrorist financing, that Employee promptly notifies the Relevant Person\\'s MLRO and provides the MLRO with all relevant details.\\n14.2.3 A Relevant Person must have policies and procedures to ensure that disciplinary action can be taken against any Employee who fails to make such a report.\\n14.2.3.Guidance\\n14.2.3.Guidance.1. Circumstances that might give rise to suspicion or reasonable grounds for suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing include:\\n(a)\\tTransactions which have no apparent purpose, which make no obvious economic sense, or which are designed or structured to avoid detection;\\n(b)\\tTransactions requested by a Person without reasonable explanation, which are out of the ordinary range of services normally requested or are outside the experience of a Relevant Person in relation to a particular customer;\\n(c)\\twhere the size or pattern of Transactions, without reasonable explanation, is out of line with any pattern that has previously emerged or may have been deliberately structured to avoid detection;\\n(d)\\ta customer\\'s refusal to provide the information requested without reasonable explanation;\\n(e)\\twhere a customer who has just entered into a business relationship uses the relationship for a single Transaction or for only a very short period of time;\\n(f)\\textensive use of offshore accounts, companies or structures in circumstances where the customer\\'s economic needs do not support such requirements;\\n(g)\\tunnecessary routing of funds through third-party accounts; or\\n(h)\\tunusual Transactions without an apparently profitable motive.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.2. CDD measures form the basis for recognising suspicious activity or Transactions. Sufficient guidance must therefore be given to the Relevant Person\\'s Employees to enable them to form a suspicion or to recognise when they have reasonable grounds to suspect that money laundering or terrorist financing is taking place. This should involve training that will enable relevant Employees to seek and assess the information that is required for them to judge whether a Person is involved in suspicious activity or Transactions related to money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.3. Where appropriate, a Relevant Person should also utilise the methods described in paragraph 1 above to detect a range of Financial Crimes, including fraud. Bearing in mind the evolving nature of Financial Crime and the methods used to further it, a Relevant Person should apply best practice when determining which behaviours would be considered suspicious and what measures are required to detect suspicious activity and Transactions. Such practices may include, but are not limited to, incorporating the analysis of customer behaviour metrics into the monitoring of suspicious activity and Transactions.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.4. The requirement for Employees to notify the Relevant Person\\'s MLRO should include situations when no business relationship was developed because the circumstances were suspicious.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.5. A Relevant Person may allow its Employees to consult with their line managers before sending a report to the MLRO. The Regulator would expect that such consultation does not prevent making a report whenever an Employee has stated that he has knowledge, suspicion or reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that a Person may be involved in money laundering. Whether or not an Employee consults with his line manager or other Employees, the responsibility remains with the Employee to decide for himself whether a notification to the MLRO should be made.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.6. An Employee, including the MLRO, who considers that a Person has engaged in or is engaging in activity or Transactions that he knows or suspects to be suspicious would not be expected to know the exact nature of the criminal offence or that the particular funds were definitely those arising from the crime of money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.7. Activity or Transactions that appear unusual are not necessarily suspicious. Even customers with a stable and predictable Transaction profile will have periodic Transactions that are unusual for them. Many customers will, for perfectly good reasons, have an erratic pattern of Transactions or account activity. So the unusual is, in the first instance, only a basis for further inquiry, which may in turn require judgement as to whether it is suspicious. A Transaction or activity may not be suspicious at the time, but if suspicions are raised later, an obligation to report it then arises.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.8. Effective CDD measures may provide the basis for recognising unusual and suspicious activity and Transactions. Refusal to provide documentation to support CDD or refusal to disclose a beneficial owner may be considered suspicious activity. Where there is a customer relationship, suspicious activity will often be one that is inconsistent with a customer\\'s known legitimate activity, or with the normal business activities for that type of account or customer. Therefore, the key to recognising \"suspicious activity\" is knowing enough about the customer and the customer\\'s normal expected activities to recognise when their activity is abnormal.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.9. A Relevant Person may consider implementing policies and procedures whereby disciplinary action is taken against an Employee who fails to notify the Relevant Person\\'s MLRO.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.10. Relevant Persons should comply with guidance issued by the EOCN with regard to identifying and reporting suspicious activity and Transactions relating to money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.\\n14.3 Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports\\n14.3.1 A Relevant Person must ensure that where the Relevant Person\\'s MLRO receives an internal notification of suspicious activity under Rule \\u200e14.2.2, the MLRO, without delay:\\n(a)\\tinvestigates and documents the circumstances in relation to which the notification made under Rule \\u200e14.2.2 was made;\\n(b)\\tdetermines whether in accordance with Federal AML Legislation a SAR/STR must be made and documents such determination; and\\n(c)\\tif required, make a SAR/STR as soon as practicable.\\n14.3.2 The MLRO must, following receipt of an internal notification of suspicious activity under Rule \\u200e14.2.2, document:\\n(a)\\tthe steps taken to investigate the circumstances in relation to which the internal notification is made; and\\n(b)\\twhere no external SAR/STR is made, the reasons why no such report was made.\\n14.3.3 Where, following a notification to the MLRO of suspicious activity under \\u200e14.2.2, no SAR/STR is made, a Relevant Person must record the reasons for not making a SAR/STR.\\n14.3.4 A Relevant Person must ensure that if the MLRO decides to make a SAR/STR, his decision is made independently and is not subject to the consent or approval of any other Person.\\n14.3.5 Relevant Persons are required to register on goAML upon receipt of their Financial Services Permission, Recognition Order or registration licence in order to submit SAR/STRs.\\n14.3.5.Guidance\\n14.3.5.Guidance.1. Relevant Persons are reminded that the failure to report suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing may constitute a criminal offence that is punishable under the laws of the U.A.E.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.2. Relevant Persons should comply with guidance issued by the EOCN regarding reporting suspicious activity and Transactions relating to money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.3. SARs/STRs under Federal AML Legislation should be submitted to the FIU via goAML. The dedicated mechanism for registering and reporting on goAML is available on the Regulator’s website. Failure to register on goAML may lead to the Regulator taking action.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.4. In the preparation of a SAR/STR, if a Relevant Person knows or assumes that the funds which form the subject of the report do not belong to a customer but to a third party, this fact and the details of the Relevant Person\\'s proposed course of further action in relation to the case should be included in the report.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.5. If a Relevant Person has filed a SAR/STR, the FIU may instruct the Relevant Person on how to continue its business relationship, including effecting any Transaction with a Person. If the customer in question expresses his wish to move the funds before the Relevant Person receives instruction from the FIU on how to proceed, the Relevant Person should immediately contact the FIU for further instructions.\\n14.4 Suspension of Transactions and “no tipping-off” requirement\\n14.4.1 A Relevant Person must not carry out Transactions that it knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting to be related to money laundering or terrorist financing until it has informed the FIU pursuant to Rule \\u200e14.3.1.\\n14.4.1.Guidance\\n14.4.1.Guidance.1. Relevant Persons are reminded that in accordance with Federal AML Legislation, Relevant Persons or any of their Employees must not tip off any Person, that is, inform any Person that he is being scrutinised, or investigated by any other competent authority, for possible involvement in suspicious Transactions or activity related to money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.4.1.Guidance.2. If a Relevant Person reasonably believes that performing CDD measures will tip off a customer or potential customer, it may choose not to pursue that process and should file a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report. Relevant Persons should ensure that their Employees are aware of and sensitive to these issues when considering the CDD measures.\\n14.5 Record-keeping\\n14.5.1 All relevant details of any notification to the MLRO under Rule \\u200e14.2 or Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports filed pursuant to Rule \\u200e14.3 must be kept for at least six years from the date on which the report was made.\\n14.6 Freezing of assets\\n14.6.Guidance \\nThe Regulator has certain powers under FSMR to impose a requirement restricting an Authorised Person or Recognised Body from disposing of or transferring property including, for example, assets or other funds suspected of relating to money laundering. It may also apply to the ADGM Courts for an order restraining a Person from transferring or disposing of any assets suspected of relating to money laundering or terrorist financing. In cases involving suspected money laundering or terrorist financing, the Regulator will usually take such action in coordination with the FIU.\\n\\n\\n15. DNFBP REGISTRATION AND SUPERVISION\\n15.Guidance\\n15.Guidance.1. FSMR gives the Regulator the power to supervise DNFBPs’ compliance with relevant Federal AML Legislation. FSMR also gives the Regulator a number of other powers in relation to DNFBPs, including powers of enforcement. This includes the power to obtain information and to conduct investigations into possible breaches of FSMR. The Regulator may also impose fines for breaches of FSMR or the Rules. It may also suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP in various circumstances.\\n15.Guidance.2. The Regulator takes a risk-based approach to regulation of persons which it supervises. Generally, the Regulator will work with DNFBPs to identify, assess, mitigate and control relevant risks where appropriate. The Guidance & Policies Manual (“GPM”) describes the Regulator’s enforcement powers under FSMR and outlines its policy for using these powers.\\n15.Guidance.3. Rule \\u200e15.1.1 requires a DNFBP to be registered by the Regulator to conduct its activities in the ADGM. Rule \\u200e15.2.1 sets out the criteria a DNFBP must meet to be registered. The Regulator may suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP where the DNFBP no longer meets the criteria for registration.\\n15.Guidance.4. A DNFBP is defined in Rule \\u200e3.2.1 and includes the following class of persons whose business is carried out in the ADGM:\\n(a)\\ta real estate agency which carries out transactions with other Persons that involve the acquiring or disposing of real property;\\n(b)\\ta dealer in precious metals or precious stones;\\n(c)\\ta dealer in any saleable item of a price equal to or greater than USD15,000;\\n(d)\\tan accounting firm, audit firm, insolvency firm or taxation consulting firm;\\n(e)\\ta law firm, notary firm or other independent legal business; or\\n(f)\\ta Company Service Provider.\\n15.Guidance.5. In determining if a Person is a DNFPB the Regulator will adopt a ‘substance over form’ approach. That is, it will consider what business or profession is in fact being carried on, and its main characteristics, and not just what business or profession the Person purports, or is licensed, to carry on in the ADGM.\\n15.Guidance.6. The Regulator considers that a “law firm, notary firm or other independent legal business, includes any business or profession that involves a legal service, including advice or services related to laws in the U.A.E. The Regulator does not consider it necessary for the purposes of the definition that the:\\n(a)\\tPerson is licensed to provide legal services in the U.A.E.; or\\n(b)\\tthe individuals or employees providing the legal service are qualified or authorised to do so.\\n15.Guidance.7. The Regulator considers that “accounting firm, audit firm, insolvency firm or taxation consulting firm”, includes forensic accounting services that use accounting skills, principles and techniques to investigate suspected illegal activity or to analyse financial information for use in legal proceedings.\\n15.1 DNFBP prohibition\\n15.1.1 A Person who is a DNFBP must not carry on any activities in or from the ADGM unless that Person is registered under AML 15.4 by the Regulator as a DNFBP.\\n15.1.2 The Regulator may delegate its powers for the registration, suspension and cancellation of a DNFBP’s registration to the Registrar of Companies.\\n15.2 Criteria for registration as a DNFBP\\n15.2.1\\n15.2.1.(1) To be registered as a DNFBP, an applicant must demonstrate to the Regulator’s satisfaction that:\\n(a)\\tit is fit and proper to perform AML/TFS functions; and\\n(b)\\tit has adequate resources, systems and controls, including policies and procedures, to comply with all applicable AML/TFS requirements under Federal AML Legislation, FSMR and these Rules;\\n15.2.1.(2) In assessing if an applicant is fit and proper under (1)(a), the Regulator may, without limiting the matters it may take into account under that paragraph, consider the applicant, its senior management, its Beneficial Owners, other entities in its Group and any other Person with whom it has a relationship.\\n15.2.1.(3) The Regulator will in assessing if an applicant is fit and proper, consider the cumulative effect of matters that, if considered individually, may be regarded as insufficient to give reasonable cause to doubt the fitness and propriety of the applicant.\\n15.3 Application for registration as a DNFBP\\n15.3.1 A Person may apply to the Regulator to be registered as a DNFBP by completing and submitting the appropriate form.\\n15.3.2 The Regulator may require an applicant to provide additional information or documents reasonably required by the Regulator for it to be able to consider an application for registration including, but not limited to, information or documents relating to the activities, ownership, group structure, financial and other resources of the applicant.\\n15.3.3 Where, at any time between filing an application and the grant or refusal of registration as a DNFBP, an applicant becomes aware of a material change in its circumstances that is reasonably likely to be relevant to its application it shall inform the Regulator in writing of the change without delay.\\n15.3.4 Any Person who is a DNFBP upon the making of this Chapter and was previously a Relevant Person prior to the making of this Chapter:\\n(a)\\tis deemed to be registered as a DNFBP at the time of the making of this Chapter; and\\n(b)\\tmust apply for registration under Rule 15.3:\\n(i)\\twithin 12 months of the making of this Chapter; or\\n(ii)\\tat the date of the renewal of its Commercial Licence under the Commercial Licensing Regulations 2015;\\nwhichever comes first.\\n15.4 Grant of an application\\n15.4.1 The Regulator may grant an application for DNFBP registration as a DNFBP if it is satisfied that the applicant meets the criteria for registration under Rule 15.2.\\n15.4.2 Where the Regulator decides to register a DNFBP, it shall as soon as is practicable inform the applicant in writing of that decision and of the date on which registration is to take effect.\\n15.5 Refusal of an application\\n15.5.1 The Regulator may refuse to grant an application for DNFBP registration where it is not satisfied that the applicant meets the criteria for registration under Rule 15.2.\\n15.6 DNFBP notifications\\n15.6.1 A DNFBP must promptly notify the Regulator of any change in its:\\n(a)\\tname;\\n(b)\\tlegal status;\\n(c)\\taddress;\\n(d)\\tMLRO;\\n(e)\\tsenior management; or\\n(f)\\tBeneficial ownership.\\n15.6.2\\n15.6.2.(1) A DNFBP must notify the Regulator in writing at least ten Business Days in advance of it ceasing to carry on the business activities that establish it as a DNFBP.\\n15.6.2.(2) The notice must include a request to cancel its registration, an explanation of the reason for the DNFBP ceasing business, the planned date of the cessation of its activities, and copies of any relevant documents must be submitted with the notice.\\n15.7 Suspension and withdrawal of DNFBP registration\\n15.7.1\\n15.7.1.(1) The Regulator may suspend the registration of a DNFBP at the request of the DNFBP or on its own initiative.\\n15.7.1.(2) The Regulator may withdraw the registration of a DNFBP:\\n(a)\\tat the request of the DNFBP;\\n(b)\\t if the Registrar of Companies notifies it that the DNFBP no longer holds the relevant commercial licence to operate in the ADGM; or\\n(c)\\ton its own initiative.\\n15.7.2\\n15.7.2.(1) The Regulator may exercise its power on its own initiative under Rule 15.7.1 (1) or (2)(c) where:\\n(a)\\tthe DNFBP no longer meets the criteria for DNFBP registration;\\n(b)\\tthe DNFBP is in breach of, or has been in breach of, the Law or Rules or other Federal AML Legislation;\\n(c)\\tthe DNFBP is insolvent or entering into administration;\\n(d)\\tthe DNFBP is no longer carrying on business in the ADGM; or\\n(e)\\tthe Regulator considers that exercising the power is necessary or desirable in the pursuit of its objectives in section 1(3) of FSMR.\\n15.7.2.Guidance\\n15.7.2.Guidance.1. A DNFBP may request the withdrawal of its registration because, for example, it no longer meets the definition of a DNFBP, becomes insolvent or enters into administration, or proposes to leave the ADGM.\\n15.7.2.Guidance.2. In addition to being able to withdraw registration at the request of a DNFBP, the Regulator may, on its own initiative, suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP in various circumstances.\\n15.8 Disclosure of regulatory status\\n15.8.1 A DNFBP must not:\\n(a)\\tmisrepresent its regulatory status with respect to the Regulator expressly or by implication; or\\n(b)\\tuse or reproduce the logo of the Regulator without express written permission from the Regulator and in accordance with any conditions for use imposed by the Regulator.\\n15.9 Co-ordination between the Regulator and the Registrar of Companies\\n15.9.1\\n15.9.1.(1) The Registrar of Companies shall not grant a Person who is a DNFBP a commercial licence to operate in the ADGM until the Regulator has confirmed to the Registrar of Companies that it intends to register the Person as a DNFBP.\\n15.9.1.(2) The Regulator shall as soon as is practicable notify the Registrar of Companies where it suspends or withdraws the registration of a DNFBP.\\n15.9.1.(3) The Registrar of Companies shall as soon as is practicable suspend or withdraw (as the case may be) the commercial licence of the DNFBP where it receives a notification under (2).\\n\\n16. NON-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS\\n16.1 Responsibility for NPO compliance\\n16.1.1 An NPO\\'s Governing Body is responsible for establishing, maintaining and monitoring the NPO’s obligations under this chapter.\\n16.1.2 An NPO must maintain information on the following:\\n(a)\\tthe purpose and objectives of its stated activities;\\n(b)\\tthe identity of the persons who own, control or direct its activities, including the Governing Body and senior management;\\n(c)\\tthe relevant controls that have been put in place to ensure that all funds are fully accounted for, and are spent in a manner that is consistent with the purpose and objectives of its stated activities; and\\n(d)\\tthe relevant measures that it has taken to confirm the identity, credentials and good standing of beneficiaries and associated NPOs to ensure that they are not involved with terrorists or terrorist organisations and that its charitable funds are not used to support terrorists or terrorist organisations.\\n16.2 Record Keeping\\n16.2.1 An NPO must maintain for a period of at least six years records of its obligations required under Rule \\u200e16.1.2, covering both domestic and international transactions, which are sufficiently detailed to verify that funds have been received and spent in a manner consistent with the purpose and objectives of the NPO.\\n16.3 Co-operation\\n16.3.1 An NPO must deal with the Regulator in an open and co-operative manner and keep the Regulator informed of significant events or anything else relating to the NPO of which the Regulator would reasonably expect to be notified.\\n16.3.2 An NPO must, at the request of the Regulator:\\n(a)\\tgive or procure the giving of specified information, Documents, files, tapes, computer data or other material in the NPO\\'s possession or control to the Regulator;\\n(b)\\tmake its Employees readily available for meetings with the Regulator;\\n(c)\\tgive the Regulator access to any information, Documents, records, files, tapes, computer data or systems, which are within the NPO\\'s possession or control and provide any facilities to the Regulator;\\n(d)\\tpermit the Regulator to copy Documents or other material on the premises of the NPO at the NPO\\'s expense;\\n(e)\\tprovide any copies of those Documents or other material as requested by the Regulator; and\\n(f)\\tanswer truthfully, fully and promptly, all questions which are put to it by the Regulator.\\n16.3.2.Guidance\\n16.3.2.Guidance.1. An NPO should have systems and controls in place to identify donors, including where a donor is resident and, where the donor is not a Natural Person, the activities it undertakes.\\n16.3.2.Guidance.2. An NPO should take into consideration money laundering risks posed by a donor, including as a result of the jurisdiction in which the donor is resident or the activities the donor undertakes.\\n16.3.2.Guidance.3. Where a donor is resident in a high-risk jurisdiction, an NPO should conduct a risk-based assessment to identify money laundering risks posed by that donor.\\n16.3.2.Guidance.4. An NPO should encourage donors to make donations through financial channels offered by Financial Institutions regulated by the Regulator or another Financial Services Regulator.'}"

INTRODUCTION\\n1.1 Application\\n1.1.1\\n1.1.1.(1) The Rules in this Rulebook (\\\"MKT\\\") are made for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 (\\\"FSMR\\\") and apply to every Person to whom that legislation applies. For the purposes of these Rules the Regulator may refer to itself as the Listing Authority.\\n1.1.1.(2) Without limiting the generality of (1), this Rulebook applies to a:\\n(a)\\tPerson making an Offer of Securities except in relation to Units of a Fund;\\n(b)\\tPerson applying to have Securities admitted to the Official List;\\n(c)\\tPerson applying to have Securities admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange;\\n(d)\\tPerson specified in Rule 4.10.1 as liable for the content of a Prospectus;\\n(e)\\tListed Entity;\\n(f)\\tReporting Entity;\\n(g)\\tPerson who is a Related Party;\\n(h)\\tPerson who is a Restricted Person;\\n(i)\\tPerson who is a Connected Person;\\n(j)\\tPerson appointed as a Sponsor, compliance adviser or other expert adviser of a Reporting Entity; and\\n(k)\\tPerson appointed under Chapter 6 as a Stabilisation Manager or Stabilisation Agent.\\n1.1.2 Where a Rule prescribes a requirement on a Listed Entity or an Undertaking, each Director, Partner or other Person charged with the management of that Listed Entity or Undertaking must take all reasonable steps within its control to secure compliance with the requirement by the Reporting Entity or Undertaking.\\n1.1.3 Where a Rule prescribes a requirement relating to a Director, Partner or Employee of a Listed Entity or an Undertaking:\\n1.1.3.(1) the Director, Partner or Employee, as the case may be, must take all reasonable steps within his control to secure compliance with the requirement; and\\n1.1.3.(2) the Listed Entity or Undertaking must take all reasonable steps to ensure compliance with the requirement by the Director, Partner or Employee.\\n1.1.3.Guidance\\n1.1.3.Guidance.1. Listed Entities and Reporting Entities. Where Securities (other than Units of a Fund) are admitted to the Official List, the Issuer of such Securities is a Listed Entity.\\n1.1.3.Guidance.2. Listed Entities and Reporting Entities. In the circumstance described in paragraph 1 above, a reference in MKT to the Reporting Entity may either refer to:\\na.\\tthe Listed Entity itself; or,\\nb.\\twhichever entity is designated by the Regulator as the Reporting Entity of that Listed Entity.\\n1.1.3.Guidance.3. Listed Entities and Reporting Entities. An example of where the Regulator may designate an entity other than the Listed Entity to be the Reporting Entity is where \\u201cCompany A\\u201d has issued a Debenture via a subsidiary securitisation vehicle \\u201cSPV X\\u201d. Whilst the Debentures of SPV X may be admitted to the Official List, making it a Listed Entity, it is unlikely to have the operational capacity to be a Reporting Entity in its own right. In such circumstances the Regulator will designate Company A as the Reporting Entity for the Debentures admitted to the Official List.\\n1.1.3.Guidance.4. Listed Entities and Reporting Entities. Therefore, any reference to a Reporting Entity in MKT should be read in the context applicable to a particular Listed Entity and any associated entities.\\n\\n1.1.3.Guidance.5. Application to Listed Funds. Where Units of a Fund are admitted to the Official List, such a Fund is a Listed Fund. A reference to a Reporting Entity in relation to a Listed Fund is a reference to the Fund Manager of that Fund, unless another person has been declared by the Regulator as the Reporting Entity of the Fund.\\n1.1.3.Guidance.6. Application to Listed Funds. Accordingly, any obligations of a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund are, unless the context requires otherwise, obligations imposed on the Reporting Entity in respect of the Listed Fund. Therefore, the obligations imposed by the FSMR and these Rules apply to the Governing Body of the Reporting Entity and to every member of the Governing Body in the manner specified in Rules 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.\\n\\n1.1.3.Guidance.7. Waivers and modifications. The Regulator may, pursuant to section 58(2) of FSMR, waive or modify the application of the provisions in FSMR concerning the admission of Securities to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange where it considers appropriate or desirable in the interests of the ADGM to do so and, in accordance with the procedures set out in paragraph 8 below.\\n1.1.3.Guidance.8. Waivers and modifications. Generally, the Regulator will exercise the section 58(2) FSMR power sparingly and only in circumstances where there is a clearly demonstrated case for granting a waiver or modification of the FSMR, such as:\\na.\\tto alleviate any undue regulatory burden on a Person in complying with the requirements in the FSMR in circumstances where investor protection intended by the relevant provisions is not reduced; or\\nb.\\tto apply to a Person upon request (i.e. on a consent basis) the provisions of the FSMR which, without a modification, will not apply to that Person. For example, an Exempt Offeror (i.e. a Person such as a government or government instrumentality included in the ADGM's Exempt Offeror List in APP 5) who is not subject to the Prospectus disclosure and the liability regime in the FSMR and these Rules may apply to the Regulator for a modification to section 61 of the FSMR so that it can make a Prospectus Offer of its Securities in accordance with the relevant Prospectus disclosure and liability regime in the FSMR and these Rules.\\n1.1.3.Guidance.9. Waivers and modifications. The Regulator also has the power, pursuant to section 9 of the FSMR, to waive or modify these Rules. The Guidance and Policies Manual (GPM) gives further information on how to seek a waiver or modification.\\n1.2 Overview of the Rulebook\\n1.2.Guidance\\n1.2.Guidance.1. Listing Rules \\u2013 chapter 2. Chapter 2 sets out the Listing Rules of the Regulator.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.2. Listed funds \\u2013 chapter 3. Chapter 3 contains, with the exception of the requirements in chapters 5 (Sponsors), 7 (Continuous Disclosure) and 8 (Systems and Controls), all the requirements applicable to a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund. These requirements, whilst mirroring, and in many cases referring directly to, the requirements applicable to other Reporting Entities, have been otherwise tailored to take account of the characteristics of Funds. These include:\\na.\\tgeneral requirements applicable to Listed Funds;\\nb.\\tProspectus requirements for the purposes of having Units of a Fund admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange; and\\nc.\\tgovernance requirements applicable to Listed Funds.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.3. Offer of Securities \\u2013 chapter 4. Chapter 4 contains the:\\na.\\trequirements applicable to a Person who:\\ni.\\tmakes an Offer of Securities (other than in respect of Units, which are covered by the Prospectus and other requirements in the Fund Rules); or\\nii.\\tapplies to have Securities admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange (other than the admission to trading of Units, which is governed by the requirements in chapter 3);\\nb.\\ttypes of Exempt Offers (i.e. Securities which can be offered without a Prospectus), Exempt Securities (i.e. Securities which can be admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange without a Prospectus) and Exempt Communications (i.e. communications relating to Securities which are not treated as a Prospectus);\\nc.\\trequirements and procedures relating to the approval of a Prospectus by the Regulator;\\nd.\\trequirements and procedures relating to the structure and content of a Prospectus including:\\ni.\\twhen material may be incorporated into a Prospectus by reference; and\\nii.\\tliability for the content of a Prospectus including the liability of Experts and other Persons whose reports or opinions are included in a Prospectus with their consent for such inclusion;\\ne.\\tcircumstances in which the Regulator may accept an Offer document prepared in accordance with the legislation applicable in a jurisdiction other than the ADGM as sufficient for the purposes of meeting the Prospectus requirements in the FSMR and these Rules; and\\nf.\\tcircumstances in which a Person may make an Offer of Retail Debentures or Sukuk.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.4. Sponsors and compliance advisers \\u2013 chapter 5. The Regulator has the discretion to require the appointment of a Sponsor, compliance adviser or other expert adviser by, as applicable, an Issuer or Reporting Entity, including that of a Listed Fund. Chapter 5 contains the requirements relating to the appointment of such Sponsors, compliance advisers and other expert advisers, and the obligations that apply to such Persons and the, as applicable, Issuer or Reporting Entity where such Sponsors or compliance advisers are appointed.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.5. Market Abuse, Price Stabilisation and Buy-back Programmes \\u2013 chapter 6. Chapter 6 sets out the Regulator's provisions on Market Abuse, as outlined within the FSMR, the Price Stabilisation Rules and the procedures for Buy-back Programmes.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.6. Continuous Disclosure \\u2013 chapter 7. Every Reporting Entity is required to make Disclosure of certain types of information either relating to the Securities of a Listed Entity or the Listed Entity itself. Such Disclosure is designed to ensure that the markets are continually updated with information that is likely to have an impact on the price of the Securities so that investors can make an informed judgement about those Securities. For this purpose, chapter 7 requires Disclosure of Inside Information, with carve outs for non disclosure of commercially sensitive information for a limited period, as well as Disclosures of interests held by Persons in positions of control or influence relating to a Listed Entity (such as Controllers and their associates, called \\\"Connected Persons\\\"), and the Disclosure of Directors' notifiable interests in the Listed Entity. The means by which Disclosure of the information required to be achieved are also specified in this chapter. Additionally, the conditions enabling a Listed Entity to request a temporary Trading Halt from making a Disclosure of Inside information are covered in this chapter.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.7. Systems and controls \\u2013 chapter 8. Chapter 8 sets out the systems and controls a Reporting Entity, including the Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund, must have in order to be able to comply with the requirements applicable to that Person.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.8. Governance of Reporting Entities \\u2013 chapter 9. Chapter 9 covers a wide range of Corporate Governance requirements applicable to Reporting Entities including:\\na.\\tseven high level Corporate Governance Principles, with best practice standards relating to those principles which apply on a \\\"comply or explain\\\" basis and which are set out in APP 4;\\nb.\\tDirectors' duties, including acting in good faith and applying due diligence and care in the discharge of their duties and functions;\\nc.\\tprovisions to ensure fair treatment of Shareholders in the conduct of affairs of the Company, such as provisions relating to communication with Shareholders;\\nd.\\tprovisions relating to new issues of Equity Securities, Restricted Securities, the reduction of Share capital and a list of matters that require approval by a majority of Shareholders voting; and\\ne.\\tprovisions to address conflicts of interest. For example individuals involved in the Senior Management of the Reporting Entity (such as executive Directors and other senior executives, called \\\"Restricted Persons\\\"), are prohibited from dealing in the Securities of the Reporting Entity during \\\"Close Periods\\\", unless prior clearance for those dealings is obtained. Similarly, Persons who qualify as Related Parties of the Reporting Entity are prohibited from entering into commercial transactions with the Reporting Entity unless certain requirements are followed.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.9.

Interpretation. Every provision in the Rulebook must be interpreted in the light of its purpose. The purpose of any provision is to be gathered first and foremost from the text of the provision in question and its context among other relevant provisions.\\n1.4.Guidance.2. Interpretation. When this section refers to a provision, this means every type of provision, including Rules and Guidance.\\n1.4.Guidance.3. Interpretation. Where reference is made in the Rulebook to another provision of the Rulebook or other ADGM legislation, it is a reference to that provision as amended from time to time.\\n1.4.Guidance.4. Interpretation. Unless the contrary intention appears:\\na.\\twords in the Rulebook importing the masculine gender include the feminine gender and words importing the feminine gender include the masculine; and\\nb.\\twords in the Rulebook in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular.\\n1.4.Guidance.5. Interpretation. If a provision in the Rulebook refers to a communication, notice, agreement, or other document \\\"in writing\\\" then, unless the contrary intention appears, it means in legible form and capable of being reproduced on paper, irrespective of the medium used. Expressions related to writing must be interpreted accordingly.\\n1.4.Guidance.6. Interpretation. Any reference to \\\"dollars\\\" or \\\"$\\\" is a reference to United States Dollars unless the contrary intention appears.\\n1.4.Guidance.7. Interpretation. Unless stated otherwise, a day means a calendar day. If an obligation falls on a calendar day which is either a Friday or Saturday or an official State holiday in the ADGM, the obligation must take place on the next calendar day which is a Business Day.\\n\\n1.4.Guidance.8. Defined terms. Defined terms are identified throughout the Rulebook by the capitalisation of the initial letter of a word or of each word in a phrase and are defined in the Glossary (\\\"GLO\\\"). Unless the context otherwise requires, where capitalisation of the initial letter is not used, an expression has its natural meaning.\\n1.4.Guidance.9. Defined terms. Where reference to Disclosure is made throughout the Rulebook, that is to the term as defined in GLO.  As this Rulebook prescribes how the Regulator has set out the information and circumstances by which a Disclosure is to be made, where there is reference to the capitalised term Disclose throughout this Rulebook, this refers to the requirement and/or mechanism to disclose the Disclosure.\\n1.5 Complaints against the Regulator\\n1.5.1 A Person who feels he has been adversely affected by the manner in which the Regulator has carried out its functions may make a complaint to the Regulator about its conduct or the conduct of its Employees.\\n1.5.2 A complaint must be in writing and should be addressed to the Chief Executive of the Regulator. The complaint will be dealt with by the Regulator in a timely manner.\\n\\n\\n1. the Listed Entity has failed to meet its continuing obligations for admission to the Official List;\\n1. the requirements in Rule 10.1.8 pertaining to a Reporting Entity are to be interpreted as applying to a Listed Fund in place of a Listed Entity; and\\n1. the requirements in Rule 7.5 pertaining to a Reporting Entity are to be interpreted as applying to a Listed Fund in place of a Listed Entity; and\\n2. THE LISTING RULES\\n2.1 Application\\n2.1.1 This chapter applies to every:\\n(a)\\tListed Entity; and\\n(b)\\tApplicant for admission of Securities to the Official List.\\n2.1.1.Guidance\\n2.1.1.Guidance.1. Listed Entities should note that some of the Listing Rules are Security specific and many apply exclusively to Issuers of Shares.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.2. The Regulator may waive or modify one or more requirements of this chapter for Issuers of Debenture or Equity Securities where appropriate, provided such waiver or modification would not unduly prejudice holders of the Issuer's Securities.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.3. The Regulator may waive or modify one or more requirements of this chapter for an Issuer of secondary Listed Securities if:\\na.\\tthe Issuer is from a jurisdiction acceptable to the Regulator, due to the regulatory regime, as it applies to its primary listing being broadly equivalent to the regulatory regime applying in ADGM;\\nb.\\tadequate arrangements exist, or will exist, for co operation between the Regulator and the other Person responsible for regulating the Regulated Exchange on which the Securities are listed on a primary listing basis or for regulating listed entities in the jurisdiction where the Securities are listed on a primary listing basis; and\\nc.\\tholders of the Issuer's Shares would not be unduly prejudiced by the waiver or modification.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.4. The Regulator may also modify one or more requirements of this chapter for an Exempt Offeror who wishes to voluntarily comply with the Listing Rules in order to include its Securities on the Official List and thereby seek admission to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange. Without such a modification an Exempt Offeror cannot have its Securities included in the Official List. This is because section 50(3) of the FSMR requires that a Recognised Investment Exchange shall not permit trading of Securities on its facilities unless those Securities are admitted to, and not suspended from, the Official List.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.5. The Regulator is aware that the timing of admittance to trading may not always coincide with the process for admission of Securities to the Official List. However, in practice, the Regulator will generally provide the Applicant with a notice of admission to the Official List on condition of a successful admission to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange within a specified period. This notice of admission can be provided to the relevant Recognised Investment Exchange when seeking admission to trading on the Recognised Investment Exchange. At all relevant times the Regulator expects to be in contact with the relevant Recognised Investment Exchange on which the Securities are to be admitted to trading.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.6. The Regulator will maintain the Official List on the ADGM website.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.7. A Person who wishes to make a complaint about a Listed Entity should use the complaints portal on the ADGM website.\\n2.2 The Listing Principles\\n2.2.Guidance\\n2.2.Guidance.1. The purpose of the Listing Principles is to ensure that Listed Entities pay due regard to the fundamental role played by them in maintaining market confidence and ensuring a fair, informed and orderly market.\\n2.2.Guidance.2. The Listing Principles are designed to assist Listed Entities in identifying their obligations and responsibilities under the Listing Rules.\\n2.2.Guidance.3. The Listing Principles apply in addition to the Corporate Governance Principles in chapter 9 which apply to all Reporting Entities.\\n2.2.Guidance.4. These Listing Principles apply to Listed Entities and/or Reporting Entities as applicable.\\n\\n2.2.1 Principle 1. A Listed Entity must take reasonable steps to ensure that its Senior Management and any other relevant Employees understand and comply with their responsibilities and obligations under the Listing Rules.\\n\\n2.2.2 Principle 2. A Listed Entity must take reasonable steps to establish and maintain adequate policies, procedures, systems and controls to enable it to comply with its obligations under the Listing Rules.\\n\\n2.2.3 Principle 3. A Listed Entity must act with integrity towards holders and potential holders of its Listed Securities.\\n\\n2.2.4 Principle 4. A Listed Entity must communicate information to holders and potential holders of its Listed Securities in such a way as to avoid the creation or continuation of a false market in such Listed Securities.\\n\\n2.2.5 Principle 5. A Listed Entity must deal with the Regulator in an open and co operative manner.\\n\\n2.2.6 Principle 6. A Listed Entity must ensure that it treats all holders of the same class of its Listed Securities equally in respect of the rights attaching to such Listed Securities.\\n\\n2.2.7 Principle 7. The structure and operations of a Listed Entity must be appropriate for it.\\n\\n2.2.8 Principle 8. A Listed Entity must ensure that the terms that apply to each class of Securities are appropriate and fair, taking into account voting and other rights.\\n2.3 General eligibility requirements\\n\\n2.3.1 Incorporation. An Applicant must be duly incorporated or otherwise validly established according to the relevant laws of its place of incorporation or establishment and be operating in conformity with its constitution.\\n\\n2.3.2 Audited financial statements.

The Regulator may modify or waive Rule 2.3.2 if it is satisfied that is desirable in the interests of investors and that investors have the necessary information available to arrive at an informed judgement about the Issuer and the Shares for which an admission to the Official List is sought.\\n2.3.2.Guidance.2. The Regulator would accept a shorter period than three years depending on the nature of the Applicant's business and any other material considerations, for example, where the Issuer has been in operation for less than three years, or where the Applicant is a Mining Exploration Reporting Entity or Petroleum Exploration Reporting Entity and is seeking admission under Rule 2.3.16 (assets eligibility test).\\n\\n2.3.3 Working capital. An Applicant seeking admission of Shares to the Official List must satisfy the Regulator that it and any Subsidiaries have sufficient working capital available for its present requirements or, if not, how it proposes to provide the additional working capital needed.\\n2.3.3.Guidance\\n2.3.3.Guidance.1. For the purposes of Rule 2.3.3, the Regulator considers \\\"present requirements\\\" to be sufficient for projected normal operations for a period of 12 months from the date of admission to the Official List.\\n2.3.3.Guidance.2. Furthermore, the Regulator considers that for the purpose of this Rule, the working capital amount should be net of:\\na.\\tthe costs of any capital raising; and\\nb.\\tin the case of Mining Exploration Reporting Entities and Petroleum Exploration Reporting Entities, the first full year\\u2019s budgeted\\ni.\\tadministration costs;\\nii.\\tDirectors\\u2019 fees; and\\niii.\\tcosts of acquiring plant, equipment, Mining Tenements and/or Petroleum Tenements, or an option over relevant Mining Tenements or Petroleum Tenements.\\n2.3.3.Guidance.3. Rule 1.4 of A1.2.2 requires the Directors of an Issuer in its Prospectus to make a statement that it has sufficient working capital for its present requirements (i.e. a \\\"clean\\\" working capital statement). If an Applicant is unable to make a clean working capital statement, the Applicant would need to make a statement that it does not have sufficient working capital and explain how additional working capital will be provided.\\n\\n2.3.4 General suitability\\n2.3.4.(1) An Applicant must demonstrate to the Regulator's satisfaction that it and its business are suitable for admission to the Official List.\\n2.3.4.(2) In satisfying itself that an Applicant and its business are suitable for admission to the Official List, the Regulator will consider:\\n(a)\\tthe Applicant's connection with its controlling Shareholders or any other Person;\\n(b)\\twhether in the Regulator's reasonable opinion the Applicant is ready and able to comply with its obligations under the FSMR and these Rules;\\n(c)\\tany matter in relation to the Applicant, its business or Securities which may harm the integrity or the reputation of the ADGM Financial System or which may pose a risk to the Regulator's objectives described under section 2 of the FSMR; and\\n(d)\\tany other matters relevant to the Applicant's suitability.\\n2.3.4.Guidance \\nThe Regulator would generally not admit to the Official List a cash shell.\\n\\n2.3.5 Management experience and expertise. An Applicant must demonstrate to the Regulator's satisfaction that its Directors have appropriate experience and expertise in the business operations of the Applicant.\\n\\n2.3.6 Controlling Shareholder\\n2.3.6.(1) Subject to (2), to be admitted to the Official List, an Applicant which has one or more controlling Shareholders must be able to demonstrate to the Regulator that it can operate its business independently of such controlling Shareholder and any Associate thereof.\\n2.3.6.(2) The requirement in (1) does not apply if an Applicant can demonstrate to the Regulator's satisfaction that holders of the Issuer's Shares would have no appreciable risk of prejudice by the involvement in the relevant business of a controlling Shareholder.\\n2.3.6.(3) For the purposes of this chapter, a controlling Shareholder is any Person, or Persons acting jointly by agreement, whether formal or otherwise, who is:\\n(a)\\tentitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, 30% or more of the voting rights at a general meeting of the Applicant; or\\n(b)\\table to control the appointment of one or more Directors who are able to exercise a majority of the votes at Board meetings of the Applicant.\\n2.3.6.Guidance \\nThe Regulator considers that for an Applicant to operate its business independently of a controlling Shareholder all transactions and relationships between the Listed Entity and any controlling Shareholder (or Associate) must be at arm's length and on normal commercial terms.\\n\\n2.3.7 Conflicts of interest\\n2.3.7.(1) An Applicant must, subject to (2) and prior to admission to the Official List, ensure that it has adequate systems and controls to eliminate or manage material conflicts of interest in its business.\\n2.3.7.(2) The Regulator may accept a proposal from an Applicant to eliminate or manage conflicts of interest within a reasonable period after admission to the Official List if the Applicant can demonstrate to the Regulator's satisfaction that holders of the Issuer's Shares would not be unduly prejudiced by the arrangements.\\n2.3.7.Guidance \\nExamples of material conflicts of interest may include Related Party Transactions in Rule 9.5 and situations in which interested Persons:\\na.\\tlend to or borrow from the Issuer or its Group;\\nb.\\tlease property to or from the Issuer or its Group; or\\nc.\\thave an interest in businesses that are competitors, suppliers or Customers of the Issuer or its Group.\\n\\n2.3.8 Validity and transferability. To be admitted to the Official List, an Applicant's Securities must:\\n(1)\\tbe duly authorised according to the requirements of the Applicant's constitution;\\n(2)\\thave any necessary statutory or other consents;\\n(3)\\tbe freely transferable; and\\n(4)\\tin the case of Shares, be fully paid and free from any liens and from any restrictions on the right of transfer.\\n2.3.8.Guidance \\nThe Regulator may, in exceptional circumstances, waive or modify Rule 2.3.8 where the Applicant has the power to disapprove the transfer of Shares, if the Regulator is satisfied that this power would not disturb the market in those Shares.\\n\\n2.3.9 Market capitalisation. An Applicant must ensure that it, and the Securities which it seeks to admit to the Official List:\\n(1)\\twhere the application relates to Shares, satisfy either the profits eligibility test in Rule 2.3.15 or the assets eligibility test in Rule 2.3.16; or\\n(2)\\twhere the application relates to Debentures, have a Market Capitalisation of at least $2 million.\\n\\n2.3.10 Shares in public hands\\n2.3.10.(1) If an application is made for the admission of a class of Shares, a sufficient number of Shares of that class must, no later than the time of admission, be in public hands.\\n2.3.10.(2) For the purposes of (1), a sufficient number of Shares will be taken to have been distributed to the public according to the following thresholds:\\n(a)\\tIn the case of a Market Capitalisation of the Issuer of under $500 million, when 20% of the Shares for which application for admission has been made are in public hands;\\n(b)\\tIn the case of a Market Capitalisation of the Issuer of $500 million or more and under $1 billion, when 15% of the Shares for which application for admission has been made are in public hands; and\\n(c)\\tIn the case of a Market Capitalisation of the Issuer of $1 billion or more, when 12% of the Shares for which application for admission has been made are in public hands.\\n2.3.10.(3) For the purposes of (1) and (2), Shares are not held in public hands if they are held, directly or indirectly by:\\n(a)\\ta Director of the Applicant or of any of its subsidiary undertakings;\\n(b)\\ta Person connected with a Director of the Applicant or any of its subsidiary undertakings;\\n(c)\\tthe trustees of an Employee Share scheme or pension fund established for the benefit of any Directors or Employees of the Applicant and its subsidiary undertakings;\\n(d)\\tany Person who under any agreement has a right to nominate a Person to the board of Directors of the Applicant;\\n(e)\\tany Person or Persons in the same Group or Persons acting in concert who have an interest in 5% or more of the Shares of the relevant class; or\\n(f)\\tholders of Restricted Securities.\\n2.3.10.Guidance \\nSufficient Shares being held in public hands (free float) is fundamental to the orderly trading and liquidity of Shares once they are admitted to trading, and therefore a key consideration of whether new Shares are appropriate to be admitted to the Official List.\\n\\n\\n2.3.11 Whole class to be listed. An application for a class of Securities to be admitted to the Official List must:\\n(1)\\tif no Securities of that class are already admitted to the Official List, relate to all Securities of that class, issued or proposed to be issued; or\\n(2)\\tif Securities of that class are already admitted to the Official List, relate to all further Securities of that class, issued or proposed to be issued.\\n\\n2.3.12 Clearing and Settlement.

The terms on which these transactions may be carried may often be agreed in the terms of engagement between the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents. The Regulator may when inspecting records kept relating to stabilisation seek the rationale for any of these transactions and the price at which they were conducted.\\n6.2.16 Price Stabilisation Register\\n6.2.16.(1) The Stabilisation Manager must, before carrying out any Price Stabilisation:\\n(a)\\tcreate a register to record the details relating to the Price Stabilisation as required by Rule 6.2.7 to 6.2.16; and\\n(b)\\testablish and implement systems and controls to keep the register updated.\\n6.2.16.(2) The Stabilisation Manager must ensure that the register contains either on a real-time or daily updated basis the following information:\\n(a)\\tthe names and contact details of all Stabilisation Agents appointed by him;\\n(b)\\tdetails of the appointment of each Stabilisation Agent, including the date of the appointment;\\n(c)\\tthe general terms and instructions (including details of the price floor and Stabilisation Window) determined by the Stabilisation Manager for his Stabilisation Agents and the date and time of the communication, variation or revocation of that information and instructions;\\n(d)\\tdetails of all correspondence passing between the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents relating to the Price Stabilisation, including all instructions and variations or revocations of appointments;\\n(e)\\teach and every transaction undertaken by the Stabilisation Manager and Stabilisation Agents in the course of the Price Stabilisation, including but not limited to the following transaction details:\\n(i)\\tthe type of Relevant Securities;\\n(ii)\\tthe price;\\n(iii)\\tthe size;\\n(iv)\\twhether the transactions were undertaken on or off the central order book of the relevant Recognised Investment Exchange;\\n(v)\\tthe date and time;\\n(vi)\\tdetails of the counterparty (if known); and\\n(vii)\\tdetails of the allotment of the Relevant Securities.\\n\\n6.2.16.(3) The Stabilisation Manager must keep the register in the English language and keep it in a location that would allow for it, or a certified copy, to be available within three Business Days to any Person permitted by Rules 6.2.16(4) and 6.2.16(5) to inspect it.\\n6.2.16.(4) The following Persons are permitted to inspect the register upon written request:\\n(a)\\tthe Regulator;\\n(b)\\tthe Recognised Investment Exchange upon which the Relevant Securities are admitted to trading; and\\n(c)\\tany other Person the Regulator considers appropriate.\\n6.2.16.(5) During the Stabilisation Window and within three months from the end of the Stabilisation Window, the Stabilisation Manager must, on any Business Day, permit the Issuer of the Relevant Securities to which the Price Stabilisation Rules apply to inspect the part of the register kept in accordance with Rule 6.2.16(2)(e).\\n6.2.16.(6) The Stabilisation Manager must keep the register for a period of six years from the end of the Stabilisation Window.\\n6.2.16.Guidance \\n\\nRule 6.2.16(1)(e)(vi) recognises that some Recognised Investment Exchanges using, for example, anonymous order books or anonymous indications of interest, allow for the identity of counterparties to sometimes be unknown prior to the effecting of transactions.\\n\\nRule 6.2.16 also accepts that some participants in the Price Stabilisation may have accrued uneconomic positions during Price Stabilisation and therefore permits a single transaction, probably at the end-of-day, to \\u2018square-off\\u2019 the positions between participants. The terms on which these transactions can be carried may often be agreed in the terms of engagement between the Stabilisation Manager and the Stabilisation Agents.  The Regulator may when inspecting records kept relating to Price Stabilisation seek the rationale for any of these transactions and the price at which they were conducted.\\n\\n6.2.17 Price Stabilisation and Dual-listings\\n6.2.17.(1) This Rule applies to a Person who carries out Price Stabilisation of dual-listed Relevant Securities.\\n6.2.17.(2) For the purposes of (1), \\u2018dual-listed Relevant Securities\\u2019 are Relevant Securities which are listed concurrently on a Recognised Investment Exchange and on either a Remote Investment Exchange or an exchange in a jurisdiction other than the ADGM.\\n6.2.17.Guidance \\n\\u2018Dual-listed Relevant Securities\\u2019 in (2) would, in relation to one Listed Security, include Certificates (e.g., global depository receipts) and Warrants over the other Listed Security.\\n\\n6.2.17.(3) Price Stabilisation in the ADGM.

This section applies to a Reporting Entity in respect of Shares, and the Board of Directors (\\\"the Board\\\") of such a Reporting Entity.\\n\\n9.2.2 Corporate Governance Principles. Pursuant to section 73 of the FSMR, the principles in Rules 9.2.3 to 9.2.9 are hereby prescribed as \\\"the Corporate Governance Principles\\\".\\n9.2.2.Guidance\\n9.2.2.Guidance.1. The Corporate Governance Principles in this section apply to Reporting Entities as mandatory high level requirements. APP 4 sets out best practice standards that may be adopted by a Reporting Entity to achieve compliance with these principles.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.2. The best practice standards in APP 4 are designed to provide a degree of flexibility so that a Reporting Entity can achieve outcomes intended by the Corporate Governance Principles whilst taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of its business.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.3. Generally, if a Reporting Entity does not adopt the best practice standards set out in APP 4, or adopts them only partially, the Regulator would expect the reasons for doing so and any alternative measures adopted to achieve the outcomes intended by the Corporate Governance Principles to be disclosed in the Prospectus and thereafter pursuant to the Disclosure required under Rule 9.2.10. Any inaccurate or false representations would lead to the imposition of civil liability in accordance with section 70 of the FSMR.\\n\\n9.2.3 Principle 1 \\u2013 Board of Directors. Every Listed Entity must have an effective Board which is collectively accountable for ensuring that the Listed Entity's business is managed prudently and soundly.\\n\\n9.2.4 Principle 2 \\u2013 Division of responsibilities. The Board must ensure that there is a clear division between the Board's responsibility for setting the strategic aims and undertaking the oversight of the Listed Entity and the Senior Management's responsibility for managing the Listed Entity's business in accordance with the strategic aims and risk parameters set by the Board.\\n\\n9.2.5 Principle 3 \\u2013 Board composition and resources. The Board, and its committees, must have an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Listed Entity's business, and adequate resources, including access to expertise as required and timely and comprehensive information relating to the affairs of the Listed Entity.\\n\\n9.2.6 Principle 4 \\u2013 Risk management and internal control systems. The Board must ensure that the Listed Entity has an adequate, effective, well defined and well integrated risk management, internal control and compliance framework.\\n\\n9.2.7 Principle 5 \\u2013 Shareholder rights and effective dialogue. The Board must ensure that the rights of Shareholders are properly safeguarded through appropriate measures that enable the Shareholders to exercise their rights effectively, promote effective dialogue with Shareholders and other key stakeholders as appropriate, and prevent any abuse or oppression of minority Shareholders.\\n\\n9.2.8 Principle 6 \\u2013 Position and prospects. The Board must ensure that the Listed Entity's financial and other reports present an accurate, balanced and understandable assessment of the Listed Entity's financial position and prospects by ensuring that there are effective internal risk control and reporting requirements.\\n\\n9.2.9 Principle 7 \\u2013 Remuneration. The Board must ensure that the Listed Entity has remuneration structures and strategies that are well aligned with the long term interests of the Listed Entity.\\n\\n9.2.10 Annual reporting on compliance.

Rule 9.2.10 reflects the \\\"comply or explain\\\" approach adopted by the Regulator in respect of the Corporate Governance Principles.\\n9.2.10.Guidance.2. With regard to the opinion required under Rule 9.2.10(3), adequate information relating to the Corporate Governance framework of the Listed Entity should be included to support the opinion, such as the identity of its chair, any committees of the Board and their role and membership, the chief executive and persons undertaking key control functions such as the head of compliance, risk control and internal audit and how their independence is achieved.

Where a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 is required under any legislation applicable to such a Person to comply with a similar or more stringent requirement than the requirements in this section, compliance with those other requirements would be sufficient for the purposes of the relevant requirement in this section.\\n9.3.1.Guidance.2. For example, in the case of a reduction of Share capital, more stringent procedures such as a special resolution (i.e. a vote of at least 75% of the Shareholders in voting) may be required under the company law or other legislation applicable to a Listed Entity in its jurisdiction of incorporation. Where this is the case, compliance with the more stringent requirements applicable to the Listed Entity suffices for the purposes of compliance with the requirements in this section dealing with a Shareholder approval by simple majority in Rule 9.3.8.\\n9.3.1.Guidance.3. The Regulator will expect a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 to consider references to a \\u201cShareholder\\u201d in this section to refer equally to holders of all classes of Securities as may be applicable in the context of the Listed Entity. For example, in a situation where holders of Debentures are to be asked to vote on a variation of rights or terms, the Regulator will expect a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 to give due consideration to the requirements of Rules 9.3.6 and 9.3.7 as if it referred to the relevant Debenture holders.\\n\\n9.3.2 Directors' duties. A Director of a Listed Entity must act:\\n(1)\\ton a fully informed basis;\\n(2)\\tin good faith;\\n(3)\\thonestly;\\n(4)\\twith due diligence and care; and\\n(5)\\tin the best interests of the Listed Entity and its Shareholders.\\n9.3.2.Guidance \\nIn order to meet the obligation to act with due diligence and care, a Director should (amongst other things) ensure that he has enough time and capacity available to devote to the job. See also the best practice standards in APP 4 which apply to Directors of Listed Entities who are subject to the Corporate Governance Principles.\\n\\n9.3.3 Equality of treatment. Subject to Rules 9.3.14 to 9.3.17, the Board of a Listed Entity must ensure equality of treatment of all holders of Securities of a particular class or type in respect of all rights attaching to the Securities of that class or type of Securities.\\n9.3.3.Guidance \\nFor the Rules relating to Weighted Voting Rights, refer to Rules 9.3.14 to 9.3.20. These set out the circumstances where a Listed Entity can potentially deviate from the \\u201cone-share, one-vote\\u201d principle established by this Rule.\\n\\n9.3.4 Reduction of Share capital.

The Board of a Listed Entity must ensure that for each meeting at which Shareholders are eligible to exercise voting rights attaching to their Securities, each Shareholder is given the right and means to vote by proxy.\\n\\n9.3.8 Other matters requiring Shareholder approval\\n9.3.8.(1) The Board of a Listed Entity must, subject to (2), ensure that a majority of Shareholders in voting approves:\\n(a)\\tany alteration of the constitutional documents of the Listed Entity including any alteration to the memorandum of association, articles of association, bylaws or any other instrument constituting the Listed Entity;\\n(b)\\tan alteration of the issued Share capital, for example Share reductions or Share consolidations, of the Listed Entity which is more than 20% of the existing issued Share capital;\\n(c)\\tany acquisition or disposal of an asset of the Listed Entity where the value of the asset involved is 25% or more of the value of the net assets of the Listed Entity as at its last published financial reports;\\n(d)\\tthe appointment or removal of a Director of the Listed Entity and the terms of such appointment;\\n(e)\\tthe appointment or removal of the auditor of the Listed Entity;\\n(f)\\tthe placing of the Listed Entity into voluntary liquidation;\\n(g)\\tthe reduction of the Share capital of the Listed Entity, in accordance with Rule 9.3.4(2);\\n(h)\\tthe issuance of, or the agreement to issue, Shares in accordance with Rule 9.7.1;\\n(i)\\ta Related Party Transaction that falls within Rule 9.5.3(1) or (3);\\n(j)\\tany creation or issuance of new Securities;\\n(k)\\tthe appointment of the chief executive as the chairman of the Board; and\\n(l)\\tany purchase by a Listed Entity of its own Securities, where requested to provide such approval in accordance with Rule 2.7.5(1).\\n9.3.8.(2) The requirement in (1) does not apply, subject to any requirements in the constitutional documents of the Listed Entity, in relation to the appointment or removal of a Director or auditor of a Listed Entity in circumstances where the immediate appointment or removal is necessary in the interests of the Listed Entity.\\n9.3.8.Guidance\\n9.3.8.Guidance.1. Under Rule 9.3.8(1)(b), an increase in the issued Share capital of a Listed Entity which results in an increase of more than 20% of its current Share capital requires Shareholder approval regardless of whether or not such an increase is within the authorised capital of the relevant Listed Entity.\\n9.3.8.Guidance.2. The circumstances in which the immediate removal of a Director or auditor may become necessary include matters affecting that Person's fitness and propriety, such as professional misconduct of such a Person.\\n\\n9.3.9 Preference Securities  . A holder of a Preference Security must have, at a minimum, rights to participate only up to a specified amount in any dividend or distribution which distinguishes their holders from holders of Ordinary Securities.\\n9.3.10 Preference Securities  .

General. This Appendix sets out, by way of Guidance, best practice standards relevant to each of the Corporate Governance Principles (the \\\"Principles\\\") set out in Rule 9.2. While the Principles have the status of Rules that apply to a Reporting Entity/Listed Entity, the standards in this document are best practice standards that may be adopted by a Reporting Entity/Listed Entity to achieve compliance with the Principles.\\nAPP 4.2. General. A Reporting Entity to which the Principles apply is required under Rule 9.2.10 to state in its annual report whether the best practice standards have been adopted. In circumstances where a Reporting Entity has not fully adopted or only partially adopted the best practice standards, it needs to explain in its annual report why the standards were not fully adopted or adopted only partially and what actions, if any, it has taken to achieve compliance with the Principles.\\nAPP 4.3. General. Section 73(2) of the FSMR provides that the Regulator is entitled to enact rules requiring a Reporting Entity to have a Corporate Governance framework which is adequate to promote prudent and sound management of the Reporting Entity in the long term interest of the Reporting Entity and its Shareholders. Accordingly, in providing its explanation in the annual report as noted in 2, a Reporting Entity should aim to illustrate how its actual practices achieve compliance with the outcomes intended by section 73 of the FSMR and the Principles, and thereby contribute to prudent and sound management of the Reporting Entity.\\nAPP 4.4. General. The annual report required under Rule 9.2.10 must include a statement by the Board of Directors (the \\\"Board\\\"), stating whether or not, in its opinion, the Corporate Governance framework of the Reporting Entity is effective in achieving the outcome required by section 73 of the FSMR and promoting compliance with the Principles, with supporting information and assumptions, and qualifications if necessary. As the Principles are the core of the Corporate Governance framework, the way in which they are applied should be the central question for the Board as it determines how the Reporting Entity conducts its affairs under its directorship in accordance with the letter and spirit of the applicable requirements including the Principles and the standards.\\nAPP 4.5. General. The \\\"comply or explain\\\" approach reflected in the standards recognises that there is more than one way to comply with the Principles to achieve sound and prudent governance of the Reporting Entity. It also gives the Reporting Entity the flexibility to tailor its governance practices to achieve effective outcomes taking into account the nature, size and complexity of its business. For example, a Reporting Entity may have a small Board to reflect the small and less complex nature of its business, as opposed to a larger and more complex business which requires a larger Board. It may not be possible to have a large number of committees of the small Board to undertake the functions of committees discussed in this Appendix. In such cases, the Board as a whole may undertake all these functions, or alternatively, combine the roles of committees as appropriate.\\nAPP 4.6. General. Where the standards set out in this Appendix are not adopted due to particular circumstances of the Reporting Entity, the reasons for deviating from the standards should be explained clearly and carefully in the Reporting Entity's annual report, thereby providing Shareholders with the opportunity to make well informed decisions with regard to their voting and the exercise of their rights.\\nAPP 4.7. General. The standards in this Appendix are not exhaustive and hence a Reporting Entity may implement any additional measures as required in order for it to comply with the Principles and contribute to sound and prudent governance of the entity.\\nPrinciple 1 \\u2013 Board of Directors\\nRule 9.2.3\\n\\\"Every Reporting Entity must have an effective Board of Directors (\\\"the Board\\\") which is collectively accountable for ensuring that the Reporting Entity's business is managed prudently and soundly.\\\"\\nAPP 4.8. General. The role of the Board is to provide leadership of the Reporting Entity within a framework of prudent and effective controls which enable risks to which the Reporting Entity is exposed to be identified, assessed and effectively managed.\\nAPP 4.9. General. The Board should set the Reporting Entity's business and strategic objectives and risk parameters, ensure that the necessary financial and human resources are in place for the Reporting Entity to meet those objectives, and review management performance in achieving those objectives and outcomes. For this purpose, the Board should:\\na.\\tdetermine the nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving the relevant strategic objectives; and\\nb.\\tset the Reporting Entity's values and standards and ensure that its obligations to its stakeholders are clearly understood and met.\\nAPP 4.10. General. The Board should meet sufficiently regularly to discharge its duties effectively. There should be a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for its decision.\\nAPP 4.11. General. The mandate, composition and working procedures of the Board should be well defined.\\nAPP 4.12. General. The annual report of the Reporting Entity should include a statement of how the Board operates and it should also set out the number of meetings of the Board.\\nPrinciple 2 \\u2013 Division of responsibilities\\nRule 9.2.4\\n\\\"The Board must ensure that there is a clear division between the Board's responsibility for setting the strategic aims and overseeing the Reporting Entity and the Senior Management's responsibility for managing the Reporting Entity's business in accordance with the strategic aims and risk parameters set by the Board.\\\"\\n\\nAPP 4.13. Board and Senior Management. The division of responsibilities between the Board and the Senior Management of the Reporting Entity should be clearly established, set out in writing, and agreed to by the Board. In assigning duties, the Board should ensure that no one individual has unfettered powers in making decisions. It should also ensure that there is a clear segregation of the functions of:\\na.\\tthe oversight of the management by the Board; and\\nb.\\tthe management of the Reporting Entity's business by the Senior Management in accordance with the strategic aims and risk parameters set by the Board.\\nAPP 4.14. Board and Senior Management. Board members may include individuals undertaking Senior Management functions. For example, the chief executive of a Reporting Entity may also be a Board member. Where this is the case, the Board should ensure that when assessing the performance of the Senior Management, the independence and objectivity of that process is achieved through appropriate mechanisms, such as the assignment of such a task to a non executive Director of the Board or a committee comprising a majority of non executive Directors.\\n\\nAPP 4.15. Chairman and Chief Executive. In order to ensure that the Board's function of providing effective oversight of the management of the Reporting Entity is not compromised, it is important that the role of the chairman of the Board and the role of the chief executive of the Reporting Entity should not be held by the same individual.\\nAPP 4.16. Chairman and Chief Executive. However, if the Board decides that the chief executive should also hold the position of the chairman of the Board, there should be effective measures to ensure that the Board is able to properly discharge its function of providing effective oversight of the management of the business of the Reporting Entity by its Senior Management. For example, the performance assessment of the chief executive and other members of the Senior Management should be undertaken by a non executive Director of the Board or a committee comprising a majority of non executive Directors who report to the Board directly on their assessment, and also, prior approval by Shareholders of the appointment of the chief executive as chairman of the Board.\\nAPP 4.17. Chairman and Chief Executive. Except where the positions of the chairman of the board and the chief executive are held by the same person, the division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive should be clearly established, set out in writing and agreed to by the Board.\\nAPP 4.18. Chairman and Chief Executive. The chairman should be responsible for providing leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of the Board's role and setting its agenda.\\nAPP 4.19. Chairman and Chief Executive. Except where the positions of the chairman of the Board and the chief executive are held by the same individual, the chairman of the Board should meet the independence criteria set out in paragraph 31.\\nAPP 4.20. Chairman and Chief Executive. The annual report of the Reporting Entity should:\\na.\\tidentify the chairman, the deputy chairman (where there is one), the Directors and the chief executive; and\\nb.\\tinclude a high level statement of which types of decisions are to be taken by the Board and which are to be delegated to the Senior Management.\\nPrinciple 3 \\u2013 Board composition and resources\\nRule 9.2.5\\n\\\"The Board and its committees must have an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Reporting Entity's business, and adequate resources, including access to expertise as required and timely and comprehensive information relating to the affairs of the Reporting Entity.\\\"\\n\\nAPP 4.21. Balance of skills and independence. A major consideration that underpins the effectiveness of the Board is the availability at the Board level of the relevant skills, expertise and resources as are necessary to discharge the Board functions, taking due account of the nature, scale, diversity and complexity of the business of the Reporting Entity.\\nAPP 4.22. Balance of skills and independence. It may well be that no single Director has all the knowledge, skills and expertise needed by a Board to discharge its functions. The Board should have an appropriate number and mix of individuals to ensure that there is an overall adequate level of knowledge, skills and expertise commensurate with the nature, scale and complexity of the business of the Reporting Entity.\\nAPP 4.23. Balance of skills and independence. In order to ensure that the Board is equipped with the necessary skills, expertise and resources appropriate to the business of the Reporting Entity, there should be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of Directors to the Board. Appointments to the Board should be made on merit and against objective criteria, with due regard to the benefits of diversity on the Board. Care should be taken to ensure that appointees have enough time available to devote to the job. This is particularly important in the case of chairmanships.\\nAPP 4.24. Balance of skills and independence. All Directors should be submitted for re appointment at regular intervals, subject to continued satisfactory performance. The Board should ensure planned and progressive refreshing of the Board to ensure the on going effectiveness of the Board, particularly the objectivity of the decision making by the Board and maintaining the skills and expertise as relevant to the Reporting Entity's business.\\nAPP 4.25. Balance of skills and independence. All Directors should be subject to election by Shareholders at the first annual general meeting after their appointment, and to re election thereafter at intervals of no more than three years. The Board should satisfy itself that there is adequate succession planning in respect of Board membership and the Senior Management, so as to ensure an orderly and smooth change over of positions whilst maintaining an appropriate balance of skills and experience within the Reporting Entity and on the Board.\\n\\nAPP 4.26. Chairman. For the appointment of a chairman, there should be a job specification, and an objective assessment against the relevant criteria including an assessment of the time commitment expected, recognising the need for availability in the event of crises. Generally, the nomination committee should undertake this function. A chairman's other significant commitments should be disclosed to the Board before appointment and included in the annual report. Changes to such commitments should be reported to the Board as they arise, and their impact explained in the next annual report.\\nAPP 4.27. Chairman. The chairman should ensure that new Directors receive an appropriate induction on joining the Board. The chairman should ensure that the Directors continually update their skills and their knowledge and familiarity with the Reporting Entity required in fulfilling their role both on the Board and its committees. All Directors should have appropriate knowledge of the Reporting Entity and should be provided with adequate access to its operations and staff to carry out their respective responsibilities.\\nAPP 4.28. Chairman. The Reporting Entity should provide the necessary resources for developing and updating its Directors' knowledge and capabilities. The chairman should regularly review and agree with each Director their training and development needs.\\n\\nAPP 4.29. Executive and non executive Directors. The Board should include a balance of executive and non executive Directors (including independent non executive Directors). No individual or small group of individuals should be able to dominate the Board's decision making. At least one third of the Board should comprise non executive Directors, of which at least two non executive Directors should be independent.\\nAPP 4.30. Executive and non executive Directors. The Board should consider a non executive Director to be \\\"independent\\\" if that Director meets, upon an assessment, objective criteria of independence set by the Board. Such independence criteria should encompass independence in character and judgement of the individual by having no commercial or other relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect or could appear to impair his judgement in a manner other than in the best interests of the Reporting Entity. In making the assessment of independence against such criteria, the Board should consider matters such as whether the Person:\\na.\\thas already served as a member of the Board for a significant period;\\nb.\\thas been an Employee of the Reporting Entity or a member of the Group within the last five years;\\nc.\\thas or has had, within the last three years, a material business relationship with the Reporting Entity, either directly or as a Partner, Shareholder, Director or senior Employee of another body that has such a relationship with the Reporting Entity;\\nd.\\treceives or has received, in the last three years, additional remuneration or payments from the Reporting Entity apart from a Director's fee, or participates in the Reporting Entity's Share option, or a performance related pay scheme, or is a member of the Reporting Entity's pension scheme;\\ne.\\tis or has been a Director, Partner or Employee of a firm which is the Reporting Entity's external auditor;\\nf.\\thas close family ties with any of the Reporting Entity's advisers, Directors or senior Employees;\\ng.\\tholds cross Directorships or has significant links with other Directors through involvement in other Companies or bodies; or\\nh.\\trepresents a significant Shareholder.\\nAPP 4.31. Executive and non executive Directors. The terms and conditions of appointment of non executive Directors should be made available for inspection by any Person at the Reporting Entity's registered office during normal business hours. The letter of appointment should set out the expected time commitment. Non executive Directors should undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet what is expected of them. Their other significant commitments should be disclosed to the Board before appointment, with a broad indication of the time involved. The Board should be notified of subsequent changes.\\nAPP 4.32. Executive and non executive Directors. The annual report of the Reporting Entity should identify each non executive Director it considers to be independent, and the chairman and members of each of the Board committees. It should also state the relevant skills and expertise which each Director brings to the Board and set out the number of meetings of each of the committees and individual attendance by Directors.\\nAPP 4.33. Executive and non executive Directors. As part of their role as members of the Board, non executive Directors should constructively challenge and help develop proposals on business objectives and strategies for achieving those objectives. Non executive Directors should scrutinise the performance of Senior Management against agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of their performance.\\n\\nAPP 4.34. Nomination committee. The Board should establish and maintain a nomination committee to lead the process for appointments and make recommendations to the Board relating to the appointment of Board members and the Senior Management. A majority of members of the nomination committee should be independent non executive Directors. The chairman of the nomination committee should be an independent non executive Director.\\nAPP 4.35. Nomination committee. The mandate, composition and working procedures of the nomination committee should be well defined. The nomination committee should make available on the website of the Reporting Entity its written terms of reference explaining its role and the authority delegated to it by the Board.\\nAPP 4.36. Nomination committee. The nomination committee should evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge, independence and experience on the Board and, in the light of this evaluation, prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment.\\nAPP 4.37. Nomination committee. A separate section of the annual report of the Reporting Entity should describe the work of the nomination committee, including the process it has used in relation to Board appointments. An explanation should be given if neither an external consultancy nor an open advertising process has been used in the appointment of the chairman or a non executive Director of the Board.\\n\\nAPP 4.38. Secretary of the Reporting Entity. The responsibilities of the Reporting Entity's secretary should clearly include, under the direction of the chairman, ensuring good information flows within the Board and its committees and between Senior Management and non executive Directors, as well as facilitating induction and assisting with professional development of Board members as required. The secretary should also be responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are fully complied with, and advising the Board through the chairman on all governance matters.\\nAPP 4.39. Secretary of the Reporting Entity. Both the appointment and removal of the secretary of the Reporting Entity should be a matter for the Board as a whole.\\n\\nAPP 4.40. Information and support. All Directors should have access to accurate, timely and clear information relating to the business and affairs of the Reporting Entity to enable them to discharge their duties, taking due account of the roles undertaken by such members. The chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Directors receive such information. Senior Management has an obligation to provide such information, but Directors should seek clarification or amplification where necessary. All Directors should also have access to the advice and services of the secretary of the Reporting Entity, as he is responsible to the Board for ensuring compliance with the Board procedures.\\nAPP 4.41. Information and support. The Board should ensure that Directors, especially non executive Directors, have access to independent professional advice at the Reporting Entity's expense where necessary to enable them to discharge their respective roles and responsibilities. Committees of the Board should also be provided with sufficient resources including information to carry out their role and responsibilities effectively.\\n\\nAPP 4.42. Performance evaluation. The Board should undertake a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual Directors at least annually.\\nAPP 4.43. Performance evaluation. The chairman of the Board should act on the results of the performance evaluation by recognising the strengths and addressing the weaknesses of the Board and making any changes to the composition of the Board as required.\\nAPP 4.44. Performance evaluation. The Board should state in the annual report how performance evaluation of the Board, its committees and its individual Directors has been conducted.\\nPrinciple 4 \\u2013 Risk management and internal control systems\\nRule 9.2.6\\n\\\"The Board must ensure that the Reporting Entity has an adequate, effective, well defined and well integrated risk management, internal control and compliance framework.\\\"\\nAPP 4.45. Performance evaluation. The Board should, at least annually, conduct a review of the effectiveness of the Reporting Entity's risk management, internal control and compliance framework and should report to the Shareholders that it has done so. The review should cover all aspects of material controls, including management, financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems. The Board may satisfy this requirement by instructing an external auditor to undertake the review and report to it on its outcome. They should satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust and effective.\\nAPP 4.46. Performance evaluation. The Board should establish formal and transparent arrangements for considering how it should apply the financial reporting and internal control systems, and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with its auditors.\\nAPP 4.47. Performance evaluation. The Board should establish policies and procedures for the identification and oversight and management of material business risks and disclose a summary of those policies and procedures in its annual report. The Board should also ensure that Senior Management implements the requisite risk management and internal control systems to manage material risks.\\n\\nAPP 4.48. Audit committee. The Board should establish and maintain an audit committee to monitor and review the Reporting Entity's internal audit function and other internal controls. The main roles and responsibilities of the audit committee should be set out in written terms of reference, be available on the website of the Reporting Entity and include at least the following:\\na.\\tmonitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Reporting Entity and any Disclosures relating to the Reporting Entity 's financial performance and reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained in them;\\nb.\\treviewing the Reporting Entity's internal financial controls and, unless expressly addressed by a separate risk committee of the Board or the Board itself, internal controls and risk management systems;\\nc.\\tmonitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Reporting Entity's internal audit function;\\nd.\\tmaking recommendations to the Board in respect of the appointment, re appointment, removal and terms of engagement, including remuneration, of the external auditor;\\ne.\\treviewing and monitoring the external auditor's independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process;\\nf.\\tdeveloping and implementing policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non audit services; and\\ng.\\treviewing the adequacy of arrangements by which staff of the Reporting Entity may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters to ensure that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow up action.\\nAPP 4.49. Audit committee. The Board should appoint at least two independent non executive Directors to the audit committee. At least one of the independent non executive Directors appointed to the audit committee should have recent and relevant financial expertise. The chair of the audit committee should be an independent non executive Director.\\nAPP 4.50. Audit committee. A separate section of the annual report should describe the work of the audit committee in discharging its responsibilities. The annual report should also explain to Shareholders how, if the auditor provides non audit services, auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded.\\nPrinciple 5 \\u2013 Shareholder rights and effective dialogue\\nRule 9.2.7\\n\\\"The Board must ensure that the rights of Shareholders are properly safeguarded through appropriate measures that enable the Shareholders to exercise their rights effectively, promote effective dialogue with Shareholders and other key stakeholders as appropriate, and prevent any abuse or oppression of minority Shareholders.\\\"\\nAPP 4.51. Audit committee. The Board as a whole has responsibility for ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue with Shareholders takes place. Such dialogue should be based on the mutual understanding of objectives and provision of adequate information relating to the Reporting Entity including financial information, and how the business and affairs of the Reporting Entity are carried out.\\nAPP 4.52. Audit committee. The Board should hold a general meeting of Shareholders at least annually.\\nAPP 4.53. Audit committee. The Board should use the annual general meeting to communicate with Shareholders on important aspects of the Reporting Entity's business and affairs and encourage their participation. Shareholders should have the opportunity to ask questions of the Board, to place items on the agenda of general meetings and to propose resolutions.\\nAPP 4.54. Audit committee. At any general meeting, the Reporting Entity should propose a separate resolution on each substantial separate issue, and should in particular propose a resolution at the annual general meeting relating to the report and accounts. For each resolution, proxy appointment forms should provide Shareholders with the option to direct their proxy to vote either for or against the resolution or to withhold their vote.\\nAPP 4.55. Audit committee. The chairman should arrange for the chairs of the audit, remuneration, and nomination committees to be available to answer questions at the annual general meeting and for all Directors to attend either in person or by electronic means.\\nAPP 4.56. Audit committee. Whilst recognising that most Shareholder contact is with the chief executive and finance Director, the chairman and other Directors, including non executive Directors as appropriate, should maintain sufficient contact with major Shareholders to understand their issues and concerns. The Board should keep in touch with Shareholder opinion using means which are most practical and efficient taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of its operations and the nature of its Shareholder base. The Board should use its website as a forum for the posting of information such as new strategies and a calendar for important meetings and other events.\\nAPP 4.57. Audit committee. The chairman should ensure that the views of Shareholders are communicated to the Board as a whole. In addition, the chairman should discuss the governance and strategy of the Reporting Entity, at least with its major Shareholders. Non executive Directors should be offered the opportunity to attend meetings with major Shareholders and should expect to attend such meetings, especially if requested by major Shareholders.\\nAPP 4.58. Audit committee. The Board should ensure that no steps are taken which may prevent Shareholders consulting with other Shareholders on issues concerning their basic Shareholder rights, subject to exceptions to prevent abuse. Similarly, the Board should also protect minority Shareholders from any oppressive or abusive action by controlling or major Shareholders.\\n\\nAPP 4.59. Other stakeholders. While Shareholders of the Reporting Entity form the major stakeholder group of the Reporting Entity, the Board should also ensure that there are adequate channels of communication with its other key stakeholders as appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its business operations, and the environment in which it operates. Such stakeholders may include Employees, creditors and business Customers of the Reporting Entity. The Board should make an assessment of the level of information that should generally be made available to the public, or to any particular group of stakeholders, relating to the affairs of the Company, and how best to make use of its website or any other channels of communication as appropriate to disseminate relevant information.\\nPrinciple 6 \\u2013Position and prospects\\nRule 9.2.8\\n\\\"The Board must ensure that the Reporting Entity's financial and other reports present an accurate, balanced and understandable assessment of the Reporting Entity's financial position and prospects by ensuring that there are effective internal risk control and reporting requirements.\\\"\\nAPP 4.60. Other stakeholders. The Board's responsibility to present a true, balanced and understandable assessment of its financial position and prospects should extend to interim and other price sensitive public reports and reports to regulators as well as to information required to be presented by law.\\nAPP 4.61. Other stakeholders. The Directors should explain in the annual financial report their responsibility for preparing that report and accounts, and there should be a statement by the auditor about their reporting responsibilities.\\nAPP 4.62. Other stakeholders. The Directors should include in the annual report an explanation of the basis on which the Reporting Entity generates or preserves value over the longer term (the business model) and the strategy for delivering the objectives of the Reporting Entity.\\nAPP 4.63. Other stakeholders. The Directors should report in annual and half yearly financial statements that the business is a going concern, with supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary.\\nPrinciple 7 \\u2013 Remuneration\\nRule 9.2.9\\n\\\"The Board must ensure that the Reporting Entity has remuneration structures and strategies that are well aligned with the long term interests of the entity.\\\"\\n\\nAPP 4.64. Directors' remuneration. Levels of remuneration of Directors should be sufficient to attract and retain Directors of appropriate quality, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of the business of the Reporting Entity, and to provide effective direction and leadership to the Reporting Entity in managing its business and affairs successfully. In doing so, the Reporting Entity should avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose.\\nAPP 4.65. Directors' remuneration. The performance related elements of remuneration should form an appropriate proportion of the total remuneration package of executive Directors and should be designed to promote the long term interests and viability of the Reporting Entity, to align their interests with those of Shareholders and other key stakeholders and to give these Directors appropriate incentives to perform at the highest levels.\\nAPP 4.66. Directors' remuneration. Levels of remuneration for non executive Directors should reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of their respective roles and the objectivity of judgement in the decision making required by them. In considering whether to grant Share options to non executive Directors, a Reporting Entity should consider whether the granting of the Share options will impair the objectivity or independence of the non executive Directors' decision making.\\nAPP 4.67. Directors' remuneration. Generally, where non executive Directors' remuneration includes Share options, rights resulting from the exercise of Share options should be subject to appropriate retention and vesting periods, generally until at least one year after the non executive Director leaves the Board.\\nAPP 4.68. Directors' remuneration. There should be a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on executive remuneration and for fixing remuneration packages of individual Directors. No Director should decide his own remuneration, and ideally, all Directors' remuneration should be subject to recommendations of any internal remuneration committee, and otherwise upon the advice of an external consultant.\\n\\nAPP 4.69. Remuneration committee. The Board should establish and maintain a remuneration committee to assess the remuneration of Directors (including the chairman). The remuneration committee should comprise at least three members, with a majority of those members being independent non executive Directors. The chair of the committee should be an independent non executive Director. In addition, the chairman of the Board may also be a member but not the chair of the committee.\\nAPP 4.70. Remuneration committee. The remuneration committee should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for all executive Directors and the chairman. The committee should also recommend and monitor the level and structure of remuneration for the Senior Management and other key control functionaries such as the risk or compliance officers and auditors, to ensure that the independence and objectivity of the decision making by such control functionaries is not compromised or impaired by their remuneration structure. An important consideration that should be taken into account in setting remuneration of key control functionaries of the Reporting Entity is that their remuneration is not substantially linked to the profits generated by business or trading units whose activities are subject to monitoring and oversight by those functionaries.\\nAPP 4.71. Remuneration committee. The mandate, composition and working procedures of the remuneration committee should be well defined. The remuneration committee should make available on the website of the Reporting Entity its written terms of reference explaining its role and the authority delegated to it by the Board.\\nAPP 4.72. Remuneration committee. The remuneration committee should also be responsible for appointing any external consultants in respect of executive Directors' remuneration. Where external consultants are appointed, a statement should be made available of whether they have any other connection with the Reporting Entity.\\nAPP 4.73. Remuneration committee. The Board itself, or where required by the articles of association or other constitutional documents, the Shareholders, should determine the remuneration of the non executive Directors.\\nAPP 4.74. Remuneration committee. The annual report of the Reporting Entity should contain sufficient information relating to the overall remuneration policy and strategy of the Reporting Entity to demonstrate that the remuneration, particularly of the executive Directors and Senior Management, properly links rewards to corporate and individual performance and outcomes, and to ensure that any performance based remuneration granted is structured in such a way so as to not induce inappropriate risk taking by such individuals.\\n\\n\\nAPP 5 LIST OF EXEMPT OFFERORS\\nAPP 5.A5.1 List of Exempt Offerors\\nAPP 5.A5.1.1 The following entities are Exempt Offerors:\\n(a)\\tProperly constituted governments, government agencies, central banks or other national monetary authorities of the following countries or jurisdictions:\\n(i)\\tOrganisation for Economic Co operation and Development (OECD) member countries;\\n(ii)\\tmember countries of the Gulf Co operation Council (GCC); or\\n(iii)\\tthe Emirate of Abu Dhabi.\\n(b)\\tThe International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and the Islamic Development Bank.\\n(c)\\tA Special Purpose Vehicle used by an entity referred to in (a) or (b) to issue Securities.\\n(d)\\tAny other country, jurisdiction or supranational organisation, or any Special Purpose Vehicle use by a country, jurisdiction or supranational organisation to issue Securities that may be approved as an Exempt Offeror by the Regulator for the purpose of that Offer.\\nAPP 5.A5.1.2 For the purposes of A5.1.1(c) and (d), the Special Purpose Vehicle may be a vehicle controlled directly by the entity or indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries.\\n\\n\\nAPP 5.A6.2 Other continuing obligations for Listed Entities\\nAPP 5.A6.2.1 This table forms part of Rule 2.7.8.\\nAPP 5.A6.2.2 A Listed Entity (or its Reporting Entity) must, on the occurrence of an event or matter specified in column 1, undertake the requirements detailed in column 2, within the time specified in column 3, in respect of the Securities identified with a \\\"\\uf0fc\\\" in column 4, of this Table.\\n/Table Start\\n\\nA6.2.1\\nEVENT / MATTER\\tREQUIREMENTS\\tTIME \\tStructured Products\\tShares\\tWarrants over Shares\\tWarrants over Debentures\\tDebentures\\tCertificates\\tUnits\\nShares\\tDebentures\\nGENERAL\\n1.\\t\\tIssue of further Debentures backed by the same asset, unless those further Debentures rank pari passu with or are subordinated to any class of Debentures which are already admitted to the Official List.\\tPrior approval of the existing holders of the existing class of Debentures must be obtained.\\tAt all times.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\t\\uf0fc\\n2.\\t\\tProxy forms in the case of equity Securities.\\tThe proxy form sent out must make provision for two way voting on all resolutions intended to be proposed at the meeting.\\tAt the same time as the sending of the notice convening the meeting.\\t\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\t\\uf0fc\\n3.\\t\\tPaying agency for Debentures and Structured Products.\\tThe Listed Entity's paying agent must provide facilities for obtaining new Securities, to replace those Securities which have been damaged, lost or stolen or destroyed and for all other purposes provided for in the terms and conditions of the Securities.\\tAt all times until the date on which no such Securities are outstanding.\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\t\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\t\\uf0fc\\nREGISTRATION\\n4.\\t\\tMaintenance of the register.\\tIf the Listed Entity does not maintain its own register, the Listed Entity must make appropriate arrangements with its registrar to ensure compliance with any relevant continuing obligations in this Appendix.\\tAt all times.\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\n5.\\t\\tReceipt of properly executed transfer documents or a request to split documents evidencing Securities.\\tThe Listed Entity shall ensure that transfers are registered by the registrar within seven Business Days of receipt of the documents evidencing the Securities. \\tAt all times.\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\n6.\\t\\tRegistration of transfers or other documents relating to or affecting the title to any Securities, splitting documents evidencing Securities, issuing documents evidencing Securities or marking or noting such documents.\\tSubject to 6 above, the Listed Entity and its registrar shall not charge investors any fee for the registration.\\tAt all times.\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\t\\uf0fc\\n7.\\t\\tAny Disclosure of the timetable for any proposed action affecting the rights of existing holders of its Listed Securities.

This was mainly attributable to lower finance costs of $[\\u25cf] million due to lower interest rates and lower loan principals.\\n\\u2022\\tOur net cash generated from operating activities decreased by $[\\u25cf] million from $[\\u25cf] million in [year] to $[\\u25cf] million in [year] due to an increase in credit sales that contributed to an increase in trade receivables of $[\\u25cf] million from $[\\u25cf] million in [year] to $[\\u25cf] million in [year].\\n\\u2022\\tOur net assets increased by $[\\u25cf] million from $[\\u25cf] million in [year] to $[\\u25cf] million in [year] mainly due to the $[\\u25cf] million increase in inventories for our new product introduced in [year].\\n\\nThe above factors are not the only factors contributing to our financial performance in FY[\\u25cf] and FY[\\u25cf].

We have a strong management team with over 20 years of experience in the industry and the management team has contributed significantly to our Company\\u2019s growth and expansion since our incorporation in [year]. We aim to strengthen our position in this industry and region by expanding our operations to [names of countries] in the next 3 years.\\n\\nWe have also recently started a joint venture with [name of company] to enter into the [secondary business] market. We believe that there is a growing market for [secondary business] in [country] given the changing lifestyles of consumers in [country].\\n\\n\\nRefer to the \\u201c[relevant section]\\u201d on page(s) [\\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information on our strategies and future plans.\\n\\nWHAT ARE THE KEY TRENDS, UNCERTANTIES, DEMANDS, COMMITMENTS OR EVENTS WHICH ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON US?\\n[Where applicable, briefly discuss, for at least the current financial year, the Issuer\\u2019s or the Group\\u2019s (as the case may be) business and financial prospects, any significant recent trends in production, sales and inventory, and in the costs and selling prices of products and services, as well as any other known trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the net sales or revenues, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause financial information disclosed in the Offer document to be not necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial condition of the Issuer or the Group (as the case may be). If there are no such trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events, provide an appropriate statement to that effect.]\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nFor the current financial year, our Directors have observed the following trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the net sales or revenues, profitability, liquidity or capital resources of the Group, or that would cause financial information disclosed in the Offer document to be not necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial condition of the Group:\\n\\n(a)\\tthe demand for [activity] has increased with the recent growth [country]\\u2019s economy.

The Issuer should not set out the entire list of risk factors found in the \\u201cRisk Factors\\u201d section of the Offer document.]\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nKEY RISKS\\n\\nWe consider the following to be the most important key risks which had materially affected or could materially affect our business operations, financial position and results, and your investment in our shares.\\n\\n\\u2022\\tAn economic downturn could negatively affect our profitability: Our industry is exposed to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty of future economic prospects. Economic downturns could have an adverse impact on overall demand. This would result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\\n\\n\\u2022\\tOur industry is highly competitive: We compete against numerous businesses and our competitors may be larger and have greater financial resources. We compete for customers, financing, employees and other resources. This creates both strong price and quality competition, which leads to increased costs in the form of marketing and customer services, in addition to price reductions. Our ability to compete effectively depends on several factors, including our market presence, our reputation, our competitors, and general trends in the industry and economy. There is no assurance that we can compete successfully.\\n\\n\\u2022\\tA substantial proportion of our revenues is derived from several major customers and loss of their business may seriously impact our financial results: Our five largest customers accounted for approximately [\\u25cf]% of our revenues for the year ended [year], and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately [\\u25cf]% of our revenues for the year ended [year]. Our revenues may significantly decrease if we lose any of these customers or if our customers reduce their volume of business with us.\\n\\n\\u2022\\tWe face risks associated with our business being conducted in [country]: As most of our operations are conducted in [country], our business may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully manage inherent risks including: unexpected political or economic developments; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unfavourable tax consequences; adverse legal or regulatory changes; insufficient protection for intellectual property rights; and complexities relating to currency and capital transfers.\\n\\n\\u2022\\tThe restrictions on our operating subsidiary\\u2019s ability to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund and operate our business: We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries in [country]. Accordingly, we will rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs, including the necessary funds to pay our operating expenses, service any debt we may incur, and pay any dividends that may be declared. The payment of dividends by [country] entities such as our subsidiaries is subject to limitations in accordance with the rules and regulations of [country], which may negatively affect our operations and profitability.\\n\\nThe above are not the only risk factors that had a material effect or could have a material effect on our business operations, financial position and results, and your shares. Refer to \\u201c[relevant section]\\u201d on page(s) [\\u25cf] of the Offer document for a discussion on other risk factors and for more information on the above risk factors. Prior to making a decision to invest in our [shares/units], you should consider all the information contained in the Offer document.\\nRefer to the \\u201c[relevant section]\\u201d on page(s) [\\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information on risk factors.\\nWHAT ARE THE RIGHTS ATTACHED TO THE SECURITIES OFFERED?\\n[Describe the type and class of shares/units being offered, including the rights attached to the shares/units and any restrictions on the free transferability of shares/units.]\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nKey Information on Shares Offered\\n\\nAs of the date of this Offer document, our issued and paid up share capital was $[\\u25cf] consisting of [\\u25cf] shares.\\n\\nWe have only one class of shares, and the shares offered will have the same rights as our other existing issued and paid-up shares, including voting rights. Shareholders will be entitled to all rights attached to their shares in proportion to their shareholding, such as any cash dividends declared by the Company and any distribution of assets upon liquidation of the Company. There are no restrictions on the transferability of our shares.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRefer to the \\u201c[relevant section]\\u201d on page(s) [\\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information.\\n\\nHOW WILL THE PROCEEDS OF THE OFFER BE USED?\\n[Provide information on the amount of proceeds raised from the offer will be allocated to each principal intended use. Information on the use of proceeds should be presented using diagrams (e.g. tables, graphs and charts) where appropriate.]\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nUse of Proceeds\\n\\nThe net proceeds to be raised in the offer (after deducting estimated expenses to be borne by us) is $[\\u25cf]. The following represents our estimate of the allocation of the gross proceeds expected to be raised from the offer, assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by vendors.\\n\\nDetails of utilisation\\t$ (million)\\tAllocation for each $1.00 gross proceeds raised\\n(1)\\tNet proceeds:\\n(a)\\tExpansion of business\\n\\n(b)\\tWorking capital and general corporate purposes\\t[\\u25cf]\\n\\n[\\u25cf]\\t[\\u25cf]\\n\\n[\\u25cf]\\n(2)\\tOther estimated expenses\\t[\\u25cf]\\t[\\u25cf]\\nTotal\\t[\\u25cf]\\t1.00\\nRefer to the \\u201c[relevant section]\\u201d on page(s) [\\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information on our use of proceeds.\\nWILL WE BE PAYING [DIVIDENDS/DISTRIBUTIONS] AFTER THE OFFER?\\n[Describe (i) the dividends/distributions per share/unit, if any, paid by the Issuer for each of the 3 most recent completed financial years, and (ii) the Issuer\\u2019s dividend/distribution policy, or if it does not have a fixed policy, to state so. Provide clear and prominent disclosure of any existing or proposed arrangement that materially enhances short-term yields while potentially diluting long-term yields. The disclosure should include a computation of the forecast distribution yield assuming that the arrangements are not in place.]\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nOver the last three financial years ended 31 December [year], [year] and [year], we have not declared and distributed dividends. We currently do not have a fixed dividend policy. Any future payment of dividends by us would depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors. If we do not pay any dividends, any return on investment may be limited to the value of our shares, and our shares may be less valuable because return on investment will depend entirely on capital appreciation.\\nRefer to the \\u201c[relevant section]\\u201d on page(s) [\\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information on our [dividend / distribution] policy.\\nDEFINITIONS\\n[Provide definitions if necessary.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTACT INFORMATION\\nWHO CAN YOU CONTACT IF YOU HAVE ENQUIRIES RELATING TO OUR OFFER?\\nHOW DO YOU CONTACT US?\\n[Provide contact details of Issuer, distributor(s)/underwriter(s) and/or issue manager(s) whom investors can contact if they have enquiries.

Whilst the Debentures of SPV X may be admitted to the Official List, making it a Listed Entity, it is unlikely to have the operational capacity to be a Reporting Entity in its own right. In such circumstances the Regulator will designate Company A as the Reporting Entity for the Debentures admitted to the Official List.\\n1.1.3.Guidance.4. Listed Entities and Reporting Entities. Therefore, any reference to a Reporting Entity in MKT should be read in the context applicable to a particular Listed Entity and any associated entities.\\n\\n1.1.3.Guidance.5. Application to Listed Funds. Where Units of a Fund are admitted to the Official List, such a Fund is a Listed Fund. A reference to a Reporting Entity in relation to a Listed Fund is a reference to the Fund Manager of that Fund, unless another person has been declared by the Regulator as the Reporting Entity of the Fund.\\n1.1.3.Guidance.6. Application to Listed Funds. Accordingly, any obligations of a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund are, unless the context requires otherwise, obligations imposed on the Reporting Entity in respect of the Listed Fund. Therefore, the obligations imposed by the FSMR and these Rules apply to the Governing Body of the Reporting Entity and to every member of the Governing Body in the manner specified in Rules 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.\\n\\n1.1.3.Guidance.7. Waivers and modifications. The Regulator may, pursuant to section 58(2) of FSMR, waive or modify the application of the provisions in FSMR concerning the admission of Securities to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange where it considers appropriate or desirable in the interests of the ADGM to do so and, in accordance with the procedures set out in paragraph 8 below.\\n1.1.3.Guidance.8. Waivers and modifications. Generally, the Regulator will exercise the section 58(2) FSMR power sparingly and only in circumstances where there is a clearly demonstrated case for granting a waiver or modification of the FSMR, such as:\\na.\\tto alleviate any undue regulatory burden on a Person in complying with the requirements in the FSMR in circumstances where investor protection intended by the relevant provisions is not reduced; or\\nb.\\tto apply to a Person upon request (i.e. on a consent basis) the provisions of the FSMR which, without a modification, will not apply to that Person. For example, an Exempt Offeror (i.e. a Person such as a government or government instrumentality included in the ADGM's Exempt Offeror List in APP 5) who is not subject to the Prospectus disclosure and the liability regime in the FSMR and these Rules may apply to the Regulator for a modification to section 61 of the FSMR so that it can make a Prospectus Offer of its Securities in accordance with the relevant Prospectus disclosure and liability regime in the FSMR and these Rules.\\n1.1.3.Guidance.9. Waivers and modifications. The Regulator also has the power, pursuant to section 9 of the FSMR, to waive or modify these Rules. The Guidance and Policies Manual (GPM) gives further information on how to seek a waiver or modification.\\n1.2 Overview of the Rulebook\\n1.2.Guidance\\n1.2.Guidance.1. Listing Rules \\u2013 chapter 2. Chapter 2 sets out the Listing Rules of the Regulator.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.2. Listed funds \\u2013 chapter 3. Chapter 3 contains, with the exception of the requirements in chapters 5 (Sponsors), 7 (Continuous Disclosure) and 8 (Systems and Controls), all the requirements applicable to a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund. These requirements, whilst mirroring, and in many cases referring directly to, the requirements applicable to other Reporting Entities, have been otherwise tailored to take account of the characteristics of Funds. These include:\\na.\\tgeneral requirements applicable to Listed Funds;\\nb.\\tProspectus requirements for the purposes of having Units of a Fund admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange; and\\nc.\\tgovernance requirements applicable to Listed Funds.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.3. Offer of Securities \\u2013 chapter 4. Chapter 4 contains the:\\na.\\trequirements applicable to a Person who:\\ni.\\tmakes an Offer of Securities (other than in respect of Units, which are covered by the Prospectus and other requirements in the Fund Rules); or\\nii.\\tapplies to have Securities admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange (other than the admission to trading of Units, which is governed by the requirements in chapter 3);\\nb.\\ttypes of Exempt Offers (i.e. Securities which can be offered without a Prospectus), Exempt Securities (i.e. Securities which can be admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange without a Prospectus) and Exempt Communications (i.e. communications relating to Securities which are not treated as a Prospectus);\\nc.\\trequirements and procedures relating to the approval of a Prospectus by the Regulator;\\nd.\\trequirements and procedures relating to the structure and content of a Prospectus including:\\ni.\\twhen material may be incorporated into a Prospectus by reference; and\\nii.\\tliability for the content of a Prospectus including the liability of Experts and other Persons whose reports or opinions are included in a Prospectus with their consent for such inclusion;\\ne.\\tcircumstances in which the Regulator may accept an Offer document prepared in accordance with the legislation applicable in a jurisdiction other than the ADGM as sufficient for the purposes of meeting the Prospectus requirements in the FSMR and these Rules; and\\nf.\\tcircumstances in which a Person may make an Offer of Retail Debentures or Sukuk.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.4. Sponsors and compliance advisers \\u2013 chapter 5. The Regulator has the discretion to require the appointment of a Sponsor, compliance adviser or other expert adviser by, as applicable, an Issuer or Reporting Entity, including that of a Listed Fund. Chapter 5 contains the requirements relating to the appointment of such Sponsors, compliance advisers and other expert advisers, and the obligations that apply to such Persons and the, as applicable, Issuer or Reporting Entity where such Sponsors or compliance advisers are appointed.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.5. Market Abuse, Price Stabilisation and Buy-back Programmes \\u2013 chapter 6. Chapter 6 sets out the Regulator's provisions on Market Abuse, as outlined within the FSMR, the Price Stabilisation Rules and the procedures for Buy-back Programmes.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.6. Continuous Disclosure \\u2013 chapter 7. Every Reporting Entity is required to make Disclosure of certain types of information either relating to the Securities of a Listed Entity or the Listed Entity itself. Such Disclosure is designed to ensure that the markets are continually updated with information that is likely to have an impact on the price of the Securities so that investors can make an informed judgement about those Securities. For this purpose, chapter 7 requires Disclosure of Inside Information, with carve outs for non disclosure of commercially sensitive information for a limited period, as well as Disclosures of interests held by Persons in positions of control or influence relating to a Listed Entity (such as Controllers and their associates, called \\\"Connected Persons\\\"), and the Disclosure of Directors' notifiable interests in the Listed Entity. The means by which Disclosure of the information required to be achieved are also specified in this chapter. Additionally, the conditions enabling a Listed Entity to request a temporary Trading Halt from making a Disclosure of Inside information are covered in this chapter.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.7. Systems and controls \\u2013 chapter 8. Chapter 8 sets out the systems and controls a Reporting Entity, including the Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund, must have in order to be able to comply with the requirements applicable to that Person.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.8. Governance of Reporting Entities \\u2013 chapter 9. Chapter 9 covers a wide range of Corporate Governance requirements applicable to Reporting Entities including:\\na.\\tseven high level Corporate Governance Principles, with best practice standards relating to those principles which apply on a \\\"comply or explain\\\" basis and which are set out in APP 4;\\nb.\\tDirectors' duties, including acting in good faith and applying due diligence and care in the discharge of their duties and functions;\\nc.\\tprovisions to ensure fair treatment of Shareholders in the conduct of affairs of the Company, such as provisions relating to communication with Shareholders;\\nd.\\tprovisions relating to new issues of Equity Securities, Restricted Securities, the reduction of Share capital and a list of matters that require approval by a majority of Shareholders voting; and\\ne.\\tprovisions to address conflicts of interest. For example individuals involved in the Senior Management of the Reporting Entity (such as executive Directors and other senior executives, called \\\"Restricted Persons\\\"), are prohibited from dealing in the Securities of the Reporting Entity during \\\"Close Periods\\\", unless prior clearance for those dealings is obtained. Similarly, Persons who qualify as Related Parties of the Reporting Entity are prohibited from entering into commercial transactions with the Reporting Entity unless certain requirements are followed.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.9. Accounting periods, financial reports and auditing \\u2013 chapter 10. Every Reporting Entity is required to prepare and file certain annual, semi annual and other periodic financial reports relating to the financial position of the relevant Listed Entity. Such reports are required to be prepared in accordance with the specified internationally accepted accounting standards and, in the case of annual financial reports, required to be audited. The requirements relating to the preparation and audit of the financial statements and the Disclosure of such reports within specified periods are set out in chapter 10.\\n\\n1.2.Guidance.10. Mining and Petroleum Reporting Entities \\u2013 chapters 11 and 12. Chapters and 12 set out the additional Disclosure requirements relevant to Mining Exploration Reporting Entities, Mining Production Reporting Entities, Petroleum Exploration Reporting Entities and Petroleum Production Reporting Entities.\\n1.3 General\\n1.3.1 A reference in this Rulebook to:\\n(1)\\t\\\"this Rulebook\\\", is a reference to this MKT Rulebook; and\\n(2)\\t\\\"Rules\\\", except where otherwise provided, is a reference to the Rules in this Rulebook.\\n1.3.2 Where a Reporting Entity is referred to in this Rulebook as a Reporting Entity in respect of a specified class of Securities, it is a reference to a Person that has become a Reporting Entity by way of such Person as an Issuer or a Listed Entity:\\n(1)\\tmaking an Offer of Securities;\\n(2)\\thaving Securities admitted to the Official List; or\\n(3)\\thaving Securities admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange;\\nof that particular specified class of Securities.\\n1.4 Interpreting the Rulebook\\n1.4.Guidance\\n1.4.Guidance.1. Interpretation. Every provision in the Rulebook must be interpreted in the light of its purpose. The purpose of any provision is to be gathered first and foremost from the text of the provision in question and its context among other relevant provisions.\\n1.4.Guidance.2. Interpretation. When this section refers to a provision, this means every type of provision, including Rules and Guidance.\\n1.4.Guidance.3. Interpretation. Where reference is made in the Rulebook to another provision of the Rulebook or other ADGM legislation, it is a reference to that provision as amended from time to time.\\n1.4.Guidance.4. Interpretation. Unless the contrary intention appears:\\na.\\twords in the Rulebook importing the masculine gender include the feminine gender and words importing the feminine gender include the masculine; and\\nb.\\twords in the Rulebook in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular.\\n1.4.Guidance.5. Interpretation. If a provision in the Rulebook refers to a communication, notice, agreement, or other document \\\"in writing\\\" then, unless the contrary intention appears, it means in legible form and capable of being reproduced on paper, irrespective of the medium used. Expressions related to writing must be interpreted accordingly.\\n1.4.Guidance.6. Interpretation. Any reference to \\\"dollars\\\" or \\\"$\\\" is a reference to United States Dollars unless the contrary intention appears.\\n1.4.Guidance.7. Interpretation. Unless stated otherwise, a day means a calendar day. If an obligation falls on a calendar day which is either a Friday or Saturday or an official State holiday in the ADGM, the obligation must take place on the next calendar day which is a Business Day.\\n\\n1.4.Guidance.8. Defined terms. Defined terms are identified throughout the Rulebook by the capitalisation of the initial letter of a word or of each word in a phrase and are defined in the Glossary (\\\"GLO\\\"). Unless the context otherwise requires, where capitalisation of the initial letter is not used, an expression has its natural meaning.\\n1.4.Guidance.9. Defined terms. Where reference to Disclosure is made throughout the Rulebook, that is to the term as defined in GLO.  As this Rulebook prescribes how the Regulator has set out the information and circumstances by which a Disclosure is to be made, where there is reference to the capitalised term Disclose throughout this Rulebook, this refers to the requirement and/or mechanism to disclose the Disclosure.\\n1.5 Complaints against the Regulator\\n1.5.1 A Person who feels he has been adversely affected by the manner in which the Regulator has carried out its functions may make a complaint to the Regulator about its conduct or the conduct of its Employees.\\n1.5.2 A complaint must be in writing and should be addressed to the Chief Executive of the Regulator. The complaint will be dealt with by the Regulator in a timely manner.\\n\\n\\n1. the Listed Entity has failed to meet its continuing obligations for admission to the Official List;\\n1. the requirements in Rule 10.1.8 pertaining to a Reporting Entity are to be interpreted as applying to a Listed Fund in place of a Listed Entity; and\\n1. the requirements in Rule 7.5 pertaining to a Reporting Entity are to be interpreted as applying to a Listed Fund in place of a Listed Entity; and\"\n",

THE LISTING RULES\\n2.1 Application\\n2.1.1 This chapter applies to every:\\n(a)\\tListed Entity; and\\n(b)\\tApplicant for admission of Securities to the Official List.\\n2.1.1.Guidance\\n2.1.1.Guidance.1. Listed Entities should note that some of the Listing Rules are Security specific and many apply exclusively to Issuers of Shares.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.2. The Regulator may waive or modify one or more requirements of this chapter for Issuers of Debenture or Equity Securities where appropriate, provided such waiver or modification would not unduly prejudice holders of the Issuer's Securities.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.3. The Regulator may waive or modify one or more requirements of this chapter for an Issuer of secondary Listed Securities if:\\na.\\tthe Issuer is from a jurisdiction acceptable to the Regulator, due to the regulatory regime, as it applies to its primary listing being broadly equivalent to the regulatory regime applying in ADGM;\\nb.\\tadequate arrangements exist, or will exist, for co operation between the Regulator and the other Person responsible for regulating the Regulated Exchange on which the Securities are listed on a primary listing basis or for regulating listed entities in the jurisdiction where the Securities are listed on a primary listing basis; and\\nc.\\tholders of the Issuer's Shares would not be unduly prejudiced by the waiver or modification.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.4. The Regulator may also modify one or more requirements of this chapter for an Exempt Offeror who wishes to voluntarily comply with the Listing Rules in order to include its Securities on the Official List and thereby seek admission to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange. Without such a modification an Exempt Offeror cannot have its Securities included in the Official List. This is because section 50(3) of the FSMR requires that a Recognised Investment Exchange shall not permit trading of Securities on its facilities unless those Securities are admitted to, and not suspended from, the Official List.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.5. The Regulator is aware that the timing of admittance to trading may not always coincide with the process for admission of Securities to the Official List. However, in practice, the Regulator will generally provide the Applicant with a notice of admission to the Official List on condition of a successful admission to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange within a specified period. This notice of admission can be provided to the relevant Recognised Investment Exchange when seeking admission to trading on the Recognised Investment Exchange. At all relevant times the Regulator expects to be in contact with the relevant Recognised Investment Exchange on which the Securities are to be admitted to trading.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.6. The Regulator will maintain the Official List on the ADGM website.\\n2.1.1.Guidance.7. A Person who wishes to make a complaint about a Listed Entity should use the complaints portal on the ADGM website.\\n2.2 The Listing Principles\\n2.2.Guidance\\n2.2.Guidance.1. The purpose of the Listing Principles is to ensure that Listed Entities pay due regard to the fundamental role played by them in maintaining market confidence and ensuring a fair, informed and orderly market.\\n2.2.Guidance.2. The Listing Principles are designed to assist Listed Entities in identifying their obligations and responsibilities under the Listing Rules.\\n2.2.Guidance.3. The Listing Principles apply in addition to the Corporate Governance Principles in chapter 9 which apply to all Reporting Entities.\\n2.2.Guidance.4. These Listing Principles apply to Listed Entities and/or Reporting Entities as applicable.\\n\\n2.2.1 Principle 1. A Listed Entity must take reasonable steps to ensure that its Senior Management and any other relevant Employees understand and comply with their responsibilities and obligations under the Listing Rules.\\n\\n2.2.2 Principle 2. A Listed Entity must take reasonable steps to establish and maintain adequate policies, procedures, systems and controls to enable it to comply with its obligations under the Listing Rules.\\n\\n2.2.3 Principle 3. A Listed Entity must act with integrity towards holders and potential holders of its Listed Securities.\\n\\n2.2.4 Principle 4. A Listed Entity must communicate information to holders and potential holders of its Listed Securities in such a way as to avoid the creation or continuation of a false market in such Listed Securities.\\n\\n2.2.5 Principle 5. A Listed Entity must deal with the Regulator in an open and co operative manner.\\n\\n2.2.6 Principle 6. A Listed Entity must ensure that it treats all holders of the same class of its Listed Securities equally in respect of the rights attaching to such Listed Securities.\\n\\n2.2.7 Principle 7. The structure and operations of a Listed Entity must be appropriate for it.\\n\\n2.2.8 Principle 8. A Listed Entity must ensure that the terms that apply to each class of Securities are appropriate and fair, taking into account voting and other rights.\\n2.3 General eligibility requirements\\n\\n2.3.1 Incorporation. An Applicant must be duly incorporated or otherwise validly established according to the relevant laws of its place of incorporation or establishment and be operating in conformity with its constitution.\\n\\n2.3.2 Audited financial statements. An Applicant must have published or filed audited accounts which:\\n(1)\\tcover a prior period of three years or any other, shorter period acceptable to the Regulator;\\n(2)\\tare consolidated for the Applicant and any of its subsidiary undertakings;\\n(3)\\thave been prepared in accordance with IFRS or other standards acceptable to the Regulator; and\\n(4)\\thave been audited and reported on by auditors in accordance with auditing standards of the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) or other standards acceptable to the Regulator.\\n2.3.2.Guidance\\n2.3.2.Guidance.1. The Regulator may modify or waive Rule 2.3.2 if it is satisfied that is desirable in the interests of investors and that investors have the necessary information available to arrive at an informed judgement about the Issuer and the Shares for which an admission to the Official List is sought.\\n2.3.2.Guidance.2. The Regulator would accept a shorter period than three years depending on the nature of the Applicant's business and any other material considerations, for example, where the Issuer has been in operation for less than three years, or where the Applicant is a Mining Exploration Reporting Entity or Petroleum Exploration Reporting Entity and is seeking admission under Rule 2.3.16 (assets eligibility test).\\n\\n2.3.3 Working capital. An Applicant seeking admission of Shares to the Official List must satisfy the Regulator that it and any Subsidiaries have sufficient working capital available for its present requirements or, if not, how it proposes to provide the additional working capital needed.\\n2.3.3.Guidance\\n2.3.3.Guidance.1. For the purposes of Rule 2.3.3, the Regulator considers \\\"present requirements\\\" to be sufficient for projected normal operations for a period of 12 months from the date of admission to the Official List.\\n2.3.3.Guidance.2. Furthermore, the Regulator considers that for the purpose of this Rule, the working capital amount should be net of:\\na.\\tthe costs of any capital raising; and\\nb.\\tin the case of Mining Exploration Reporting Entities and Petroleum Exploration Reporting Entities, the first full year\\u2019s budgeted\\ni.\\tadministration costs;\\nii.\\tDirectors\\u2019 fees; and\\niii.\\tcosts of acquiring plant, equipment, Mining Tenements and/or Petroleum Tenements, or an option over relevant Mining Tenements or Petroleum Tenements.\\n2.3.3.Guidance.3. Rule 1.4 of A1.2.2 requires the Directors of an Issuer in its Prospectus to make a statement that it has sufficient working capital for its present requirements (i.e. a \\\"clean\\\" working capital statement). If an Applicant is unable to make a clean working capital statement, the Applicant would need to make a statement that it does not have sufficient working capital and explain how additional working capital will be provided.\\n\\n2.3.4 General suitability\\n2.3.4.(1) An Applicant must demonstrate to the Regulator's satisfaction that it and its business are suitable for admission to the Official List.\\n2.3.4.(2) In satisfying itself that an Applicant and its business are suitable for admission to the Official List, the Regulator will consider:\\n(a)\\tthe Applicant's connection with its controlling Shareholders or any other Person;\\n(b)\\twhether in the Regulator's reasonable opinion the Applicant is ready and able to comply with its obligations under the FSMR and these Rules;\\n(c)\\tany matter in relation to the Applicant, its business or Securities which may harm the integrity or the reputation of the ADGM Financial System or which may pose a risk to the Regulator's objectives described under section 2 of the FSMR; and\\n(d)\\tany other matters relevant to the Applicant's suitability.\\n2.3.4.Guidance \\nThe Regulator would generally not admit to the Official List a cash shell.\\n\\n2.3.5 Management experience and expertise. An Applicant must demonstrate to the Regulator's satisfaction that its Directors have appropriate experience and expertise in the business operations of the Applicant.\\n\\n2.3.6 Controlling Shareholder\\n2.3.6.(1) Subject to (2), to be admitted to the Official List, an Applicant which has one or more controlling Shareholders must be able to demonstrate to the Regulator that it can operate its business independently of such controlling Shareholder and any Associate thereof.\\n2.3.6.(2) The requirement in (1) does not apply if an Applicant can demonstrate to the Regulator's satisfaction that holders of the Issuer's Shares would have no appreciable risk of prejudice by the involvement in the relevant business of a controlling Shareholder.\\n2.3.6.(3) For the purposes of this chapter, a controlling Shareholder is any Person, or Persons acting jointly by agreement, whether formal or otherwise, who is:\\n(a)\\tentitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, 30% or more of the voting rights at a general meeting of the Applicant; or\\n(b)\\table to control the appointment of one or more Directors who are able to exercise a majority of the votes at Board meetings of the Applicant.\\n2.3.6.Guidance \\nThe Regulator considers that for an Applicant to operate its business independently of a controlling Shareholder all transactions and relationships between the Listed Entity and any controlling Shareholder (or Associate) must be at arm's length and on normal commercial terms.\\n\\n2.3.7 Conflicts of interest\\n2.3.7.(1) An Applicant must, subject to (2) and prior to admission to the Official List, ensure that it has adequate systems and controls to eliminate or manage material conflicts of interest in its business.\\n2.3.7.(2) The Regulator may accept a proposal from an Applicant to eliminate or manage conflicts of interest within a reasonable period after admission to the Official List if the Applicant can demonstrate to the Regulator's satisfaction that holders of the Issuer's Shares would not be unduly prejudiced by the arrangements.\\n2.3.7.Guidance \\nExamples of material conflicts of interest may include Related Party Transactions in Rule 9.5 and situations in which interested Persons:\\na.\\tlend to or borrow from the Issuer or its Group;\\nb.\\tlease property to or from the Issuer or its Group; or\\nc.\\thave an interest in businesses that are competitors, suppliers or Customers of the Issuer or its Group.\\n\\n2.3.8 Validity and transferability. To be admitted to the Official List, an Applicant's Securities must:\\n(1)\\tbe duly authorised according to the requirements of the Applicant's constitution;\\n(2)\\thave any necessary statutory or other consents;\\n(3)\\tbe freely transferable; and\\n(4)\\tin the case of Shares, be fully paid and free from any liens and from any restrictions on the right of transfer.\\n2.3.8.Guidance \\nThe Regulator may, in exceptional circumstances, waive or modify Rule 2.3.8 where the Applicant has the power to disapprove the transfer of Shares, if the Regulator is satisfied that this power would not disturb the market in those Shares.\\n\\n2.3.9 Market capitalisation. An Applicant must ensure that it, and the Securities which it seeks to admit to the Official List:\\n(1)\\twhere the application relates to Shares, satisfy either the profits eligibility test in Rule 2.3.15 or the assets eligibility test in Rule 2.3.16; or\\n(2)\\twhere the application relates to Debentures, have a Market Capitalisation of at least $2 million.\\n\\n2.3.10 Shares in public hands\\n2.3.10.(1) If an application is made for the admission of a class of Shares, a sufficient number of Shares of that class must, no later than the time of admission, be in public hands.\\n2.3.10.(2) For the purposes of (1), a sufficient number of Shares will be taken to have been distributed to the public according to the following thresholds:\\n(a)\\tIn the case of a Market Capitalisation of the Issuer of under $500 million, when 20% of the Shares for which application for admission has been made are in public hands;\\n(b)\\tIn the case of a Market Capitalisation of the Issuer of $500 million or more and under $1 billion, when 15% of the Shares for which application for admission has been made are in public hands; and\\n(c)\\tIn the case of a Market Capitalisation of the Issuer of $1 billion or more, when 12% of the Shares for which application for admission has been made are in public hands.\\n2.3.10.(3) For the purposes of (1) and (2), Shares are not held in public hands if they are held, directly or indirectly by:\\n(a)\\ta Director of the Applicant or of any of its subsidiary undertakings;\\n(b)\\ta Person connected with a Director of the Applicant or any of its subsidiary undertakings;\\n(c)\\tthe trustees of an Employee Share scheme or pension fund established for the benefit of any Directors or Employees of the Applicant and its subsidiary undertakings;\\n(d)\\tany Person who under any agreement has a right to nominate a Person to the board of Directors of the Applicant;\\n(e)\\tany Person or Persons in the same Group or Persons acting in concert who have an interest in 5% or more of the Shares of the relevant class; or\\n(f)\\tholders of Restricted Securities.\\n2.3.10.Guidance \\nSufficient Shares being held in public hands (free float) is fundamental to the orderly trading and liquidity of Shares once they are admitted to trading, and therefore a key consideration of whether new Shares are appropriate to be admitted to the Official List.\\n\\n\\n2.3.11 Whole class to be listed. An application for a class of Securities to be admitted to the Official List must:\\n(1)\\tif no Securities of that class are already admitted to the Official List, relate to all Securities of that class, issued or proposed to be issued; or\\n(2)\\tif Securities of that class are already admitted to the Official List, relate to all further Securities of that class, issued or proposed to be issued.\\n\\n2.3.12 Clearing and Settlement. To be admitted to the Official List:\\n(1)\\tan Applicant's Securities must be eligible for electronic settlement; and\\n(2)\\tthe arrangements for the clearing and settlement of trading in such Securities must be acceptable to the Regulator.\\n\\n2.3.13 Warrants\\n2.3.13.(1) To be admitted to the Official List, the total of all issued Warrants to subscribe for Shares must not, subject to (2), exceed 20% of the issued Share capital of the Applicant as at the time of issue of the Warrants.\\n2.3.13.(2) Any rights under an Employee Share scheme are excluded from the 20% calculation in (1).\\nDepository receipts\\n2.3.14 A Listed Entity in respect of Certificates which are depository receipts must ensure that:\\n(1)\\tat the time of issue of such Certificates the payments received from the issue of the depository receipts are sufficient to meet the payments required for the issuance of the underlying Securities; and\\n(2)\\tthe underlying Securities or any rights, monies or benefits related to the underlying Securities are not treated as assets or liabilities of the Issuer of the Certificates under the law, whether for the purposes of insolvency or otherwise.\\n\\n2.3.15 Profits eligibility test. In order to meet the profits eligibility test, an Applicant must satisfy the following requirements.\\n2.3.15.(1) The Applicant, or its immediate successor, must be a going concern.\\n2.3.15.(2) The Applicant\\u2019s main business activity at the date of its Application must be the same as it was during its last three full financial years.\\n2.3.15.(3) The Applicant\\u2019s:\\n(a)\\taggregated Profit From Continuing Operations for the last three full financial years was at least $1 million; and\\n(b)\\tconsolidated Profit From Continuing Operations for the twelve months to a date, no more than two months before the date of Application, was at least $500,000.\\n2.3.15.(4) The Applicant must submit to the Regulator the following records, as applicable:\\n(a)\\tAudited accounts, for the purposes of this Rule and Rule 2.3.2(1), for the last three full financial years, noting that:\\n(i)\\tif the Applicant applies for admission less than ninety days after the end of its last financial year, unless the Applicant has audited accounts for its latest full financial year, the accounts may be for the three years to the end of the previous financial year, but must also include audited or reviewed accounts for its most recent semi-annual financial reporting period; and\\n(ii)\\tif the Applicant applies for admission more than six months and seventy-five days after the end of its last financial year, audited or reviewed accounts for its most recent semi-annual financial reporting period (or longer period if available).\\n(b)\\tUnless the Regulator agrees it is not needed, a reviewed pro forma statement of financial position.

A Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents may also sell short on the market to facilitate Price Stabilisation or in order to close out or liquidate positions established by Price Stabilisation.\\n6.2.13 Appointment of Stabilisation Manager and Stabilisation Agents\\n6.2.13.(1) An Issuer/Reporting Entity who intends to carry out Price Stabilisation of its Relevant Securities must:\\n(a)\\tappoint in writing a Stabilisation Manager;\\n(b)\\tnotify the Regulator of the appointment, including the name and business address of the Stabilisation Manager, the date of commencement of the appointment and an address for service in the ADGM of the Stabilisation Manager; and\\n(c)\\tprior to the appointment of the Stabilisation Manager, take reasonable steps to ensure that the Stabilisation Manager has the required skills, resources and experience to conduct the functions of a Stabilisation Manager.\\n6.2.13.(2) An Issuer/Reporting Entity must notify the Regulator immediately if the appointment of the Stabilisation Manager is to be terminated, or on the resignation of its Stabilisation Manager, giving the reasons for the cessation of the appointment.\\n6.2.13.(3) An Issuer/Reporting Entity must appoint a Stabilisation Manager to fill any vacancy in relation to the occurrence of an event specified in (2) and ensure that the replacement Stabilisation Manager can serve as such at the time the vacancy arises or as soon as reasonably practicable.\\n6.2.13.(4) Where a Stabilisation Manager appointed by an Issuer/Reporting Entity is not suitable in the opinion of the Regulator, or where a Stabilisation Manager has not been appointed, the Regulator may direct the Issuer/Reporting Entity to appoint or replace a Stabilisation Manager in accordance with the requirements in MKT 6.2.\\n6.2.14 Terms of Appointment for a Stabilisation Manager and Stabilisation Agents\\n6.2.14.(1) The terms of appointment of a Stabilisation Manager must include at least the following information:\\n(a)\\tthe period of the Stabilisation Window;\\n(b)\\tthe Offer Price;\\n(c)\\twhether the Stabilisation Manager has discretion to commence Price Stabilisation at the Offer Price;\\n(d)\\twhether the Stabilisation Manager is permitted to appoint Stabilisation Agents;\\n(e)\\ta term whereby the Stabilisation Manager agrees unconditionally to submit to the jurisdiction of the Regulator and the ADGM Courts in relation to the activities of the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents in carrying out Price Stabilisation; and\\n(f)\\tany other information that the Stabilisation Manager believes it will reasonably need to conduct Price Stabilisation effectively.\\n6.2.14.(2) The Stabilisation Manager may appoint in writing one or more Stabilisation Agents to assist them in conducting Price Stabilisation.\\n6.2.14.(3) The terms of appointment of a Stabilisation Agent must not create a legal relationship other than that of principal and agent whereby the Stabilisation Manager as principal is responsible and liable for any and all acts carried out by its Stabilisation Agent.\\n6.2.14.(4) The Stabilisation Manager must establish a Price Stabilisation register and take reasonable steps to satisfy himself that the mechanisms required to update the register are in place.\\n6.2.15 Restrictions on transactions with Stabilisation Agents\\n6.2.15.(1) A Stabilisation Manager must not during the Stabilisation Window enter into a transaction as principal with any of his Stabilisation Agents in the Relevant Securities which are the subject of Price Stabilisation.\\n6.2.15.(2) The requirement in (1) does not apply:\\n(a)\\tif at the time of the transaction, neither the Stabilisation Manager nor his Stabilisation Agent knew or could reasonably have known the identity of his counterparty; or\\n(b)\\twhere the transaction between the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agent is undertaken solely for the purpose of reallocating the risk of positions that were taken by the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agent in the course of Price Stabilisation and the transaction is priced accordingly.\\n6.2.15.Guidance \\nSome participants in the Price Stabilisation may have accrued positions during stabilisation and Rule 6.2.15 permits transactions to \\u2018square-off\\u2019 the positions between participants.  The terms on which these transactions may be carried may often be agreed in the terms of engagement between the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents. The Regulator may when inspecting records kept relating to stabilisation seek the rationale for any of these transactions and the price at which they were conducted.\\n6.2.16 Price Stabilisation Register\\n6.2.16.(1) The Stabilisation Manager must, before carrying out any Price Stabilisation:\\n(a)\\tcreate a register to record the details relating to the Price Stabilisation as required by Rule 6.2.7 to 6.2.16; and\\n(b)\\testablish and implement systems and controls to keep the register updated.\\n6.2.16.(2) The Stabilisation Manager must ensure that the register contains either on a real-time or daily updated basis the following information:\\n(a)\\tthe names and contact details of all Stabilisation Agents appointed by him;\\n(b)\\tdetails of the appointment of each Stabilisation Agent, including the date of the appointment;\\n(c)\\tthe general terms and instructions (including details of the price floor and Stabilisation Window) determined by the Stabilisation Manager for his Stabilisation Agents and the date and time of the communication, variation or revocation of that information and instructions;\\n(d)\\tdetails of all correspondence passing between the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents relating to the Price Stabilisation, including all instructions and variations or revocations of appointments;\\n(e)\\teach and every transaction undertaken by the Stabilisation Manager and Stabilisation Agents in the course of the Price Stabilisation, including but not limited to the following transaction details:\\n(i)\\tthe type of Relevant Securities;\\n(ii)\\tthe price;\\n(iii)\\tthe size;\\n(iv)\\twhether the transactions were undertaken on or off the central order book of the relevant Recognised Investment Exchange;\\n(v)\\tthe date and time;\\n(vi)\\tdetails of the counterparty (if known); and\\n(vii)\\tdetails of the allotment of the Relevant Securities.\\n\\n6.2.16.(3) The Stabilisation Manager must keep the register in the English language and keep it in a location that would allow for it, or a certified copy, to be available within three Business Days to any Person permitted by Rules 6.2.16(4) and 6.2.16(5) to inspect it.\\n6.2.16.(4) The following Persons are permitted to inspect the register upon written request:\\n(a)\\tthe Regulator;\\n(b)\\tthe Recognised Investment Exchange upon which the Relevant Securities are admitted to trading; and\\n(c)\\tany other Person the Regulator considers appropriate.\\n6.2.16.(5) During the Stabilisation Window and within three months from the end of the Stabilisation Window, the Stabilisation Manager must, on any Business Day, permit the Issuer of the Relevant Securities to which the Price Stabilisation Rules apply to inspect the part of the register kept in accordance with Rule 6.2.16(2)(e).\\n6.2.16.(6) The Stabilisation Manager must keep the register for a period of six years from the end of the Stabilisation Window.\\n6.2.16.Guidance \\n\\nRule 6.2.16(1)(e)(vi) recognises that some Recognised Investment Exchanges using, for example, anonymous order books or anonymous indications of interest, allow for the identity of counterparties to sometimes be unknown prior to the effecting of transactions.\\n\\nRule 6.2.16 also accepts that some participants in the Price Stabilisation may have accrued uneconomic positions during Price Stabilisation and therefore permits a single transaction, probably at the end-of-day, to \\u2018square-off\\u2019 the positions between participants. The terms on which these transactions can be carried may often be agreed in the terms of engagement between the Stabilisation Manager and the Stabilisation Agents.  The Regulator may when inspecting records kept relating to Price Stabilisation seek the rationale for any of these transactions and the price at which they were conducted.\\n\\n6.2.17 Price Stabilisation and Dual-listings\\n6.2.17.(1) This Rule applies to a Person who carries out Price Stabilisation of dual-listed Relevant Securities.\\n6.2.17.(2) For the purposes of (1), \\u2018dual-listed Relevant Securities\\u2019 are Relevant Securities which are listed concurrently on a Recognised Investment Exchange and on either a Remote Investment Exchange or an exchange in a jurisdiction other than the ADGM.\\n6.2.17.Guidance \\n\\u2018Dual-listed Relevant Securities\\u2019 in (2) would, in relation to one Listed Security, include Certificates (e.g., global depository receipts) and Warrants over the other Listed Security.\\n\\n6.2.17.(3) Price Stabilisation in the ADGM.

GOVERNANCE OF REPORTING ENTITIES\\n9.Guidance \\nGovernance requirements set out under this chapter are designed for the purposes of section 73 of the FSMR.\\n9.1 Application\\n9.1.1\\n9.1.1.(1) This chapter applies to every Reporting Entity except where a narrower application is provided in respect of any particular class of Securities.\\n9.1.1.(2) This chapter does not apply to a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund.\\n9.1.1.Guidance \\nSee chapter 3 for the governance requirements applicable to Reporting Entities of Listed Funds.\\n9.2 Corporate Governance Principles\\n\\n9.2.1 Application. This section applies to a Reporting Entity in respect of Shares, and the Board of Directors (\\\"the Board\\\") of such a Reporting Entity.\\n\\n9.2.2 Corporate Governance Principles. Pursuant to section 73 of the FSMR, the principles in Rules 9.2.3 to 9.2.9 are hereby prescribed as \\\"the Corporate Governance Principles\\\".\\n9.2.2.Guidance\\n9.2.2.Guidance.1. The Corporate Governance Principles in this section apply to Reporting Entities as mandatory high level requirements. APP 4 sets out best practice standards that may be adopted by a Reporting Entity to achieve compliance with these principles.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.2. The best practice standards in APP 4 are designed to provide a degree of flexibility so that a Reporting Entity can achieve outcomes intended by the Corporate Governance Principles whilst taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of its business.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.3. Generally, if a Reporting Entity does not adopt the best practice standards set out in APP 4, or adopts them only partially, the Regulator would expect the reasons for doing so and any alternative measures adopted to achieve the outcomes intended by the Corporate Governance Principles to be disclosed in the Prospectus and thereafter pursuant to the Disclosure required under Rule 9.2.10. Any inaccurate or false representations would lead to the imposition of civil liability in accordance with section 70 of the FSMR.\\n\\n9.2.3 Principle 1 \\u2013 Board of Directors. Every Listed Entity must have an effective Board which is collectively accountable for ensuring that the Listed Entity's business is managed prudently and soundly.\\n\\n9.2.4 Principle 2 \\u2013 Division of responsibilities. The Board must ensure that there is a clear division between the Board's responsibility for setting the strategic aims and undertaking the oversight of the Listed Entity and the Senior Management's responsibility for managing the Listed Entity's business in accordance with the strategic aims and risk parameters set by the Board.\\n\\n9.2.5 Principle 3 \\u2013 Board composition and resources. The Board, and its committees, must have an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Listed Entity's business, and adequate resources, including access to expertise as required and timely and comprehensive information relating to the affairs of the Listed Entity.\\n\\n9.2.6 Principle 4 \\u2013 Risk management and internal control systems. The Board must ensure that the Listed Entity has an adequate, effective, well defined and well integrated risk management, internal control and compliance framework.\\n\\n9.2.7 Principle 5 \\u2013 Shareholder rights and effective dialogue. The Board must ensure that the rights of Shareholders are properly safeguarded through appropriate measures that enable the Shareholders to exercise their rights effectively, promote effective dialogue with Shareholders and other key stakeholders as appropriate, and prevent any abuse or oppression of minority Shareholders.\\n\\n9.2.8 Principle 6 \\u2013 Position and prospects. The Board must ensure that the Listed Entity's financial and other reports present an accurate, balanced and understandable assessment of the Listed Entity's financial position and prospects by ensuring that there are effective internal risk control and reporting requirements.\\n\\n9.2.9 Principle 7 \\u2013 Remuneration. The Board must ensure that the Listed Entity has remuneration structures and strategies that are well aligned with the long term interests of the Listed Entity.\\n\\n9.2.10 Annual reporting on compliance. The annual financial report of a Listed Entity to which this section applies must:\\n(1)\\tstate whether the best practice standards specified in APP 4 (the \\\"Corporate Governance Principles\\\") have been adopted by the Listed Entity;\\n(2)\\tif the best practice standards in APP 4 have not been fully adopted or have been only partially adopted explain:\\n(a)\\twhy the best practice standards were not adopted fully or adopted only partially, as is relevant; and\\n(b)\\twhat actions, if any, have been taken by the Listed Entity to achieve compliance with the Corporate Governance Principles to the extent the relevant best practice standards were not adopted, or were only partially adopted; and\\n(3)\\tinclude a statement by Directors whether or not, in their opinion, the Corporate Governance framework of the Listed Entity is effective in promoting compliance with the Corporate Governance Principles, with supporting information and assumptions, and qualifications if necessary.\\n9.2.10.Guidance\\n9.2.10.Guidance.1. Rule 9.2.10 reflects the \\\"comply or explain\\\" approach adopted by the Regulator in respect of the Corporate Governance Principles.\\n9.2.10.Guidance.2. With regard to the opinion required under Rule 9.2.10(3), adequate information relating to the Corporate Governance framework of the Listed Entity should be included to support the opinion, such as the identity of its chair, any committees of the Board and their role and membership, the chief executive and persons undertaking key control functions such as the head of compliance, risk control and internal audit and how their independence is achieved. See also the Disclosure of information required under APP 2.\\n9.2.10.Guidance.3. Listed Entities are required to produce an annual financial report in accordance with Rule 10.1.4.\\n9.3 Directors' duties and fair treatment of Shareholders\\n\\n9.3.1 Application. This section applies to:\\n(a)\\tthe Board of a Listed Entity; and\\n(b)\\teach individual Director who is a member of such a Board.\\n9.3.1.Guidance\\n9.3.1.Guidance.1. Where a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 is required under any legislation applicable to such a Person to comply with a similar or more stringent requirement than the requirements in this section, compliance with those other requirements would be sufficient for the purposes of the relevant requirement in this section.\\n9.3.1.Guidance.2. For example, in the case of a reduction of Share capital, more stringent procedures such as a special resolution (i.e. a vote of at least 75% of the Shareholders in voting) may be required under the company law or other legislation applicable to a Listed Entity in its jurisdiction of incorporation. Where this is the case, compliance with the more stringent requirements applicable to the Listed Entity suffices for the purposes of compliance with the requirements in this section dealing with a Shareholder approval by simple majority in Rule 9.3.8.\\n9.3.1.Guidance.3. The Regulator will expect a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 to consider references to a \\u201cShareholder\\u201d in this section to refer equally to holders of all classes of Securities as may be applicable in the context of the Listed Entity. For example, in a situation where holders of Debentures are to be asked to vote on a variation of rights or terms, the Regulator will expect a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 to give due consideration to the requirements of Rules 9.3.6 and 9.3.7 as if it referred to the relevant Debenture holders.\\n\\n9.3.2 Directors' duties. A Director of a Listed Entity must act:\\n(1)\\ton a fully informed basis;\\n(2)\\tin good faith;\\n(3)\\thonestly;\\n(4)\\twith due diligence and care; and\\n(5)\\tin the best interests of the Listed Entity and its Shareholders.\\n9.3.2.Guidance \\nIn order to meet the obligation to act with due diligence and care, a Director should (amongst other things) ensure that he has enough time and capacity available to devote to the job. See also the best practice standards in APP 4 which apply to Directors of Listed Entities who are subject to the Corporate Governance Principles.\\n\\n9.3.3 Equality of treatment. Subject to Rules 9.3.14 to 9.3.17, the Board of a Listed Entity must ensure equality of treatment of all holders of Securities of a particular class or type in respect of all rights attaching to the Securities of that class or type of Securities.\\n9.3.3.Guidance \\nFor the Rules relating to Weighted Voting Rights, refer to Rules 9.3.14 to 9.3.20. These set out the circumstances where a Listed Entity can potentially deviate from the \\u201cone-share, one-vote\\u201d principle established by this Rule.\\n\\n9.3.4 Reduction of Share capital. The Board of a Listed Entity must ensure that a Listed Entity does not purchase its own Shares unless:\\n(1)\\tthe purchase does not materially prejudice the Listed Entity's ability to pay its creditors as they fall due;\\n(2)\\tit has obtained prior approval of Shareholders in meeting by a majority vote; and\\n(3)\\tprior to the meeting seeking the consent referred to in (2), the notice of the meeting and any accompanying documents relating to the purchase is filed with the Regulator.\\n9.3.5 [Deleted]\\n\\n9.3.6 Communications with Shareholders\\n9.3.6.(1) The Board of a Listed Entity must ensure that all the necessary information and facilities are available to its Shareholders to enable them to exercise the rights attaching to their Shares on a well informed basis.\\n9.3.6.(2) Without limiting the generality of the obligation in (1), the Board must ensure that the Shareholders:\\n(a)\\tare provided with the necessary information relating to the matters to be determined at meetings to enable them to exercise their right to vote, including the proxy forms and notice of meetings; and\\n(b)\\thave access to any relevant notices or circulars giving information in relation to the rights attaching to the Securities.\\n9.3.6.Guidance \\nIn adhering to its obligations in (2)(b), the Board of a Listed Entity incorporated in ADGM must comply with the time periods for giving such notices specified by the Companies Regulations 2015.\\n\\n9.3.7 Proxy solicitation. The Board of a Listed Entity must ensure that for each meeting at which Shareholders are eligible to exercise voting rights attaching to their Securities, each Shareholder is given the right and means to vote by proxy.\\n\\n9.3.8 Other matters requiring Shareholder approval\\n9.3.8.(1) The Board of a Listed Entity must, subject to (2), ensure that a majority of Shareholders in voting approves:\\n(a)\\tany alteration of the constitutional documents of the Listed Entity including any alteration to the memorandum of association, articles of association, bylaws or any other instrument constituting the Listed Entity;\\n(b)\\tan alteration of the issued Share capital, for example Share reductions or Share consolidations, of the Listed Entity which is more than 20% of the existing issued Share capital;\\n(c)\\tany acquisition or disposal of an asset of the Listed Entity where the value of the asset involved is 25% or more of the value of the net assets of the Listed Entity as at its last published financial reports;\\n(d)\\tthe appointment or removal of a Director of the Listed Entity and the terms of such appointment;\\n(e)\\tthe appointment or removal of the auditor of the Listed Entity;\\n(f)\\tthe placing of the Listed Entity into voluntary liquidation;\\n(g)\\tthe reduction of the Share capital of the Listed Entity, in accordance with Rule 9.3.4(2);\\n(h)\\tthe issuance of, or the agreement to issue, Shares in accordance with Rule 9.7.1;\\n(i)\\ta Related Party Transaction that falls within Rule 9.5.3(1) or (3);\\n(j)\\tany creation or issuance of new Securities;\\n(k)\\tthe appointment of the chief executive as the chairman of the Board; and\\n(l)\\tany purchase by a Listed Entity of its own Securities, where requested to provide such approval in accordance with Rule 2.7.5(1).\\n9.3.8.(2) The requirement in (1) does not apply, subject to any requirements in the constitutional documents of the Listed Entity, in relation to the appointment or removal of a Director or auditor of a Listed Entity in circumstances where the immediate appointment or removal is necessary in the interests of the Listed Entity.\\n9.3.8.Guidance\\n9.3.8.Guidance.1. Under Rule 9.3.8(1)(b), an increase in the issued Share capital of a Listed Entity which results in an increase of more than 20% of its current Share capital requires Shareholder approval regardless of whether or not such an increase is within the authorised capital of the relevant Listed Entity.\\n9.3.8.Guidance.2. The circumstances in which the immediate removal of a Director or auditor may become necessary include matters affecting that Person's fitness and propriety, such as professional misconduct of such a Person.\\n\\n9.3.9 Preference Securities  . A holder of a Preference Security must have, at a minimum, rights to participate only up to a specified amount in any dividend or distribution which distinguishes their holders from holders of Ordinary Securities.\\n9.3.10 Preference Securities  . A holder of a Preference Security must only be entitled to a right to vote:\\n(1)\\twhen a dividend or distribution (or part of a dividend or distribution) is in arrears in respect of a Security;\\n(2)\\ton a resolution that affects rights attached to the Preference Security;\\n(3)\\ton a resolution relating to a reduction of the Share capital of a Listed Entity;\\n(4)\\ton a resolution relating to a buy-back agreement;\\n(5)\\ton a resolution for a Listed Entity to be wound up;\\n(6)\\ton a resolution for a Listed Entity to dispose of the whole of its business and undertaking; or\\n(7)\\tduring the winding up of a Listed Entity.\\n9.3.11 Preference Securities  .

A holder of a Preference Security must have rights to receive notices, reports and audited financial statements, and admission to meetings of Shareholders, equal to the rights of holders of Ordinary Securities.\\n9.3.13 Preference Securities  . When a Listed Entity is wound up, the holder of a Preference Security must have a right to the return of capital in preference to holders of Ordinary Securities.\\n\\n9.3.14 Weighted Voting Rights. A Listed Entity may, upon approval from the Regulator, allot, issue or grant Shares with Weighted Voting Rights, altering its Share capital in relation to the equality and proportionality of Shareholder voting power and equity interest (as established in Rule 9.3.3).\\n9.3.15 Weighted Voting Rights. A Listed Entity, with Shares with Weighted Voting Rights on issue, must ensure that:\\n(1)\\tits Share capital must not result, in the view of the Regulator, in the potential for material conflicts between the interests of controlling shareholders\\u2019 interests, and those of its other shareholders;\\nGuidance\\nListed Entities must consider their wider governance responsibilities, including as set out in these Rules and the Corporate Governance Best Practice Standards in APP 4.  Consideration of the use of \\u2018sunset clauses\\u2019, whether they be event-driven or time-based, is also expected.\\n(2)\\tthe beneficiaries of Shares with Weighted Voting Rights must beneficially own collectively at least 10% of the underlying economic interest in the Listed Entity\\u2019s total issued Share capital at the time of admission to the Official List;\\n(3)\\tWeighted Voting Rights must not account for more than 75% of voting rights represented in person or by proxy and voting in favour of a resolution at any shareholder meeting of a Listed Entity; and\\n(4)\\tthe offer of Shares with Weighted Voting Rights must not increase the proportion of Shares that carry Weighted Voting Rights above the proportion on issue at the time of admission to the Official List.\\nRestriction on Transfer of Shares with Weighted Voting Rights\\n9.3.16 The Weighted Voting Rights attached to a beneficiary\\u2019s Shares must cease upon transfer to another person of the beneficial ownership of, or economic interest in, those Shares or the control over the voting rights attached to them (through voting proxies or otherwise).\\n\\n9.3.17 Resolutions requiring voting on a one vote per Share basis.

      "            \"APP 4 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BEST PRACTICE STANDARDS\\n\\nAPP 4.1. General. This Appendix sets out, by way of Guidance, best practice standards relevant to each of the Corporate Governance Principles (the \\\"Principles\\\") set out in Rule 9.2. While the Principles have the status of Rules that apply to a Reporting Entity/Listed Entity, the standards in this document are best practice standards that may be adopted by a Reporting Entity/Listed Entity to achieve compliance with the Principles.\\nAPP 4.2. General. A Reporting Entity to which the Principles apply is required under Rule 9.2.10 to state in its annual report whether the best practice standards have been adopted. In circumstances where a Reporting Entity has not fully adopted or only partially adopted the best practice standards, it needs to explain in its annual report why the standards were not fully adopted or adopted only partially and what actions, if any, it has taken to achieve compliance with the Principles.\\nAPP 4.3. General. Section 73(2) of the FSMR provides that the Regulator is entitled to enact rules requiring a Reporting Entity to have a Corporate Governance framework which is adequate to promote prudent and sound management of the Reporting Entity in the long term interest of the Reporting Entity and its Shareholders. Accordingly, in providing its explanation in the annual report as noted in 2, a Reporting Entity should aim to illustrate how its actual practices achieve compliance with the outcomes intended by section 73 of the FSMR and the Principles, and thereby contribute to prudent and sound management of the Reporting Entity.\\nAPP 4.4. General. The annual report required under Rule 9.2.10 must include a statement by the Board of Directors (the \\\"Board\\\"), stating whether or not, in its opinion, the Corporate Governance framework of the Reporting Entity is effective in achieving the outcome required by section 73 of the FSMR and promoting compliance with the Principles, with supporting information and assumptions, and qualifications if necessary. As the Principles are the core of the Corporate Governance framework, the way in which they are applied should be the central question for the Board as it determines how the Reporting Entity conducts its affairs under its directorship in accordance with the letter and spirit of the applicable requirements including the Principles and the standards.\\nAPP 4.5. General. The \\\"comply or explain\\\" approach reflected in the standards recognises that there is more than one way to comply with the Principles to achieve sound and prudent governance of the Reporting Entity. It also gives the Reporting Entity the flexibility to tailor its governance practices to achieve effective outcomes taking into account the nature, size and complexity of its business. For example, a Reporting Entity may have a small Board to reflect the small and less complex nature of its business, as opposed to a larger and more complex business which requires a larger Board. It may not be possible to have a large number of committees of the small Board to undertake the functions of committees discussed in this Appendix. In such cases, the Board as a whole may undertake all these functions, or alternatively, combine the roles of committees as appropriate.\\nAPP 4.6. General. Where the standards set out in this Appendix are not adopted due to particular circumstances of the Reporting Entity, the reasons for deviating from the standards should be explained clearly and carefully in the Reporting Entity's annual report, thereby providing Shareholders with the opportunity to make well informed decisions with regard to their voting and the exercise of their rights.\\nAPP 4.7. General. The standards in this Appendix are not exhaustive and hence a Reporting Entity may implement any additional measures as required in order for it to comply with the Principles and contribute to sound and prudent governance of the entity.\\nPrinciple 1 \\u2013 Board of Directors\\nRule 9.2.3\\n\\\"Every Reporting Entity must have an effective Board of Directors (\\\"the Board\\\") which is collectively accountable for ensuring that the Reporting Entity's business is managed prudently and soundly.\\\"\\nAPP 4.8. General. The role of the Board is to provide leadership of the Reporting Entity within a framework of prudent and effective controls which enable risks to which the Reporting Entity is exposed to be identified, assessed and effectively managed.\\nAPP 4.9. General. The Board should set the Reporting Entity's business and strategic objectives and risk parameters, ensure that the necessary financial and human resources are in place for the Reporting Entity to meet those objectives, and review management performance in achieving those objectives and outcomes. For this purpose, the Board should:\\na.\\tdetermine the nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving the relevant strategic objectives; and\\nb.\\tset the Reporting Entity's values and standards and ensure that its obligations to its stakeholders are clearly understood and met.\\nAPP 4.10. General. The Board should meet sufficiently regularly to discharge its duties effectively. There should be a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for its decision.\\nAPP 4.11. General. The mandate, composition and working procedures of the Board should be well defined.\\nAPP 4.12. General. The annual report of the Reporting Entity should include a statement of how the Board operates and it should also set out the number of meetings of the Board.\\nPrinciple 2 \\u2013 Division of responsibilities\\nRule 9.2.4\\n\\\"The Board must ensure that there is a clear division between the Board's responsibility for setting the strategic aims and overseeing the Reporting Entity and the Senior Management's responsibility for managing the Reporting Entity's business in accordance with the strategic aims and risk parameters set by the Board.\\\"\\n\\nAPP 4.13. Board and Senior Management. The division of responsibilities between the Board and the Senior Management of the Reporting Entity should be clearly established, set out in writing, and agreed to by the Board. In assigning duties, the Board should ensure that no one individual has unfettered powers in making decisions. It should also ensure that there is a clear segregation of the functions of:\\na.\\tthe oversight of the management by the Board; and\\nb.\\tthe management of the Reporting Entity's business by the Senior Management in accordance with the strategic aims and risk parameters set by the Board.\\nAPP 4.14. Board and Senior Management. Board members may include individuals undertaking Senior Management functions. For example, the chief executive of a Reporting Entity may also be a Board member. Where this is the case, the Board should ensure that when assessing the performance of the Senior Management, the independence and objectivity of that process is achieved through appropriate mechanisms, such as the assignment of such a task to a non executive Director of the Board or a committee comprising a majority of non executive Directors.\\n\\nAPP 4.15. Chairman and Chief Executive. In order to ensure that the Board's function of providing effective oversight of the management of the Reporting Entity is not compromised, it is important that the role of the chairman of the Board and the role of the chief executive of the Reporting Entity should not be held by the same individual.\\nAPP 4.16. Chairman and Chief Executive. However, if the Board decides that the chief executive should also hold the position of the chairman of the Board, there should be effective measures to ensure that the Board is able to properly discharge its function of providing effective oversight of the management of the business of the Reporting Entity by its Senior Management. For example, the performance assessment of the chief executive and other members of the Senior Management should be undertaken by a non executive Director of the Board or a committee comprising a majority of non executive Directors who report to the Board directly on their assessment, and also, prior approval by Shareholders of the appointment of the chief executive as chairman of the Board.\\nAPP 4.17. Chairman and Chief Executive. Except where the positions of the chairman of the board and the chief executive are held by the same person, the division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive should be clearly established, set out in writing and agreed to by the Board.\\nAPP 4.18. Chairman and Chief Executive. The chairman should be responsible for providing leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of the Board's role and setting its agenda.\\nAPP 4.19. Chairman and Chief Executive. Except where the positions of the chairman of the Board and the chief executive are held by the same individual, the chairman of the Board should meet the independence criteria set out in paragraph 31.\\nAPP 4.20. Chairman and Chief Executive. The annual report of the Reporting Entity should:\\na.\\tidentify the chairman, the deputy chairman (where there is one), the Directors and the chief executive; and\\nb.\\tinclude a high level statement of which types of decisions are to be taken by the Board and which are to be delegated to the Senior Management.\\nPrinciple 3 \\u2013 Board composition and resources\\nRule 9.2.5\\n\\\"The Board and its committees must have an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Reporting Entity's business, and adequate resources, including access to expertise as required and timely and comprehensive information relating to the affairs of the Reporting Entity.\\\"\\n\\nAPP 4.21. Balance of skills and independence. A major consideration that underpins the effectiveness of the Board is the availability at the Board level of the relevant skills, expertise and resources as are necessary to discharge the Board functions, taking due account of the nature, scale, diversity and complexity of the business of the Reporting Entity.\\nAPP 4.22. Balance of skills and independence. It may well be that no single Director has all the knowledge, skills and expertise needed by a Board to discharge its functions. The Board should have an appropriate number and mix of individuals to ensure that there is an overall adequate level of knowledge, skills and expertise commensurate with the nature, scale and complexity of the business of the Reporting Entity.\\nAPP 4.23. Balance of skills and independence. In order to ensure that the Board is equipped with the necessary skills, expertise and resources appropriate to the business of the Reporting Entity, there should be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of Directors to the Board. Appointments to the Board should be made on merit and against objective criteria, with due regard to the benefits of diversity on the Board. Care should be taken to ensure that appointees have enough time available to devote to the job. This is particularly important in the case of chairmanships.\\nAPP 4.24. Balance of skills and independence. All Directors should be submitted for re appointment at regular intervals, subject to continued satisfactory performance. The Board should ensure planned and progressive refreshing of the Board to ensure the on going effectiveness of the Board, particularly the objectivity of the decision making by the Board and maintaining the skills and expertise as relevant to the Reporting Entity's business.\\nAPP 4.25. Balance of skills and independence. All Directors should be subject to election by Shareholders at the first annual general meeting after their appointment, and to re election thereafter at intervals of no more than three years. The Board should satisfy itself that there is adequate succession planning in respect of Board membership and the Senior Management, so as to ensure an orderly and smooth change over of positions whilst maintaining an appropriate balance of skills and experience within the Reporting Entity and on the Board.\\n\\nAPP 4.26. Chairman. For the appointment of a chairman, there should be a job specification, and an objective assessment against the relevant criteria including an assessment of the time commitment expected, recognising the need for availability in the event of crises. Generally, the nomination committee should undertake this function. A chairman's other significant commitments should be disclosed to the Board before appointment and included in the annual report. Changes to such commitments should be reported to the Board as they arise, and their impact explained in the next annual report.\\nAPP 4.27. Chairman. The chairman should ensure that new Directors receive an appropriate induction on joining the Board. The chairman should ensure that the Directors continually update their skills and their knowledge and familiarity with the Reporting Entity required in fulfilling their role both on the Board and its committees. All Directors should have appropriate knowledge of the Reporting Entity and should be provided with adequate access to its operations and staff to carry out their respective responsibilities.\\nAPP 4.28. Chairman. The Reporting Entity should provide the necessary resources for developing and updating its Directors' knowledge and capabilities. The chairman should regularly review and agree with each Director their training and development needs.\\n\\nAPP 4.29. Executive and non executive Directors. The Board should include a balance of executive and non executive Directors (including independent non executive Directors). No individual or small group of individuals should be able to dominate the Board's decision making. At least one third of the Board should comprise non executive Directors, of which at least two non executive Directors should be independent.\\nAPP 4.30. Executive and non executive Directors. The Board should consider a non executive Director to be \\\"independent\\\" if that Director meets, upon an assessment, objective criteria of independence set by the Board. Such independence criteria should encompass independence in character and judgement of the individual by having no commercial or other relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect or could appear to impair his judgement in a manner other than in the best interests of the Reporting Entity. In making the assessment of independence against such criteria, the Board should consider matters such as whether the Person:\\na.\\thas already served as a member of the Board for a significant period;\\nb.\\thas been an Employee of the Reporting Entity or a member of the Group within the last five years;\\nc.\\thas or has had, within the last three years, a material business relationship with the Reporting Entity, either directly or as a Partner, Shareholder, Director or senior Employee of another body that has such a relationship with the Reporting Entity;\\nd.\\treceives or has received, in the last three years, additional remuneration or payments from the Reporting Entity apart from a Director's fee, or participates in the Reporting Entity's Share option, or a performance related pay scheme, or is a member of the Reporting Entity's pension scheme;\\ne.\\tis or has been a Director, Partner or Employee of a firm which is the Reporting Entity's external auditor;\\nf.\\thas close family ties with any of the Reporting Entity's advisers, Directors or senior Employees;\\ng.\\tholds cross Directorships or has significant links with other Directors through involvement in other Companies or bodies; or\\nh.\\trepresents a significant Shareholder.\\nAPP 4.31. Executive and non executive Directors. The terms and conditions of appointment of non executive Directors should be made available for inspection by any Person at the Reporting Entity's registered office during normal business hours. The letter of appointment should set out the expected time commitment. Non executive Directors should undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet what is expected of them. Their other significant commitments should be disclosed to the Board before appointment, with a broad indication of the time involved. The Board should be notified of subsequent changes.\\nAPP 4.32. Executive and non executive Directors. The annual report of the Reporting Entity should identify each non executive Director it considers to be independent, and the chairman and members of each of the Board committees. It should also state the relevant skills and expertise which each Director brings to the Board and set out the number of meetings of each of the committees and individual attendance by Directors.\\nAPP 4.33. Executive and non executive Directors. As part of their role as members of the Board, non executive Directors should constructively challenge and help develop proposals on business objectives and strategies for achieving those objectives. Non executive Directors should scrutinise the performance of Senior Management against agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of their performance.\\n\\nAPP 4.34. Nomination committee. The Board should establish and maintain a nomination committee to lead the process for appointments and make recommendations to the Board relating to the appointment of Board members and the Senior Management. A majority of members of the nomination committee should be independent non executive Directors. The chairman of the nomination committee should be an independent non executive Director.\\nAPP 4.35. Nomination committee. The mandate, composition and working procedures of the nomination committee should be well defined. The nomination committee should make available on the website of the Reporting Entity its written terms of reference explaining its role and the authority delegated to it by the Board.\\nAPP 4.36. Nomination committee. The nomination committee should evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge, independence and experience on the Board and, in the light of this evaluation, prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment.\\nAPP 4.37. Nomination committee. A separate section of the annual report of the Reporting Entity should describe the work of the nomination committee, including the process it has used in relation to Board appointments. An explanation should be given if neither an external consultancy nor an open advertising process has been used in the appointment of the chairman or a non executive Director of the Board.\\n\\nAPP 4.38. Secretary of the Reporting Entity. The responsibilities of the Reporting Entity's secretary should clearly include, under the direction of the chairman, ensuring good information flows within the Board and its committees and between Senior Management and non executive Directors, as well as facilitating induction and assisting with professional development of Board members as required. The secretary should also be responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are fully complied with, and advising the Board through the chairman on all governance matters.\\nAPP 4.39. Secretary of the Reporting Entity. Both the appointment and removal of the secretary of the Reporting Entity should be a matter for the Board as a whole.\\n\\nAPP 4.40. Information and support. All Directors should have access to accurate, timely and clear information relating to the business and affairs of the Reporting Entity to enable them to discharge their duties, taking due account of the roles undertaken by such members. The chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Directors receive such information. Senior Management has an obligation to provide such information, but Directors should seek clarification or amplification where necessary. All Directors should also have access to the advice and services of the secretary of the Reporting Entity, as he is responsible to the Board for ensuring compliance with the Board procedures.\\nAPP 4.41. Information and support. The Board should ensure that Directors, especially non executive Directors, have access to independent professional advice at the Reporting Entity's expense where necessary to enable them to discharge their respective roles and responsibilities. Committees of the Board should also be provided with sufficient resources including information to carry out their role and responsibilities effectively.\\n\\nAPP 4.42. Performance evaluation. The Board should undertake a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual Directors at least annually.\\nAPP 4.43. Performance evaluation. The chairman of the Board should act on the results of the performance evaluation by recognising the strengths and addressing the weaknesses of the Board and making any changes to the composition of the Board as required.\\nAPP 4.44. Performance evaluation. The Board should state in the annual report how performance evaluation of the Board, its committees and its individual Directors has been conducted.\\nPrinciple 4 \\u2013 Risk management and internal control systems\\nRule 9.2.6\\n\\\"The Board must ensure that the Reporting Entity has an adequate, effective, well defined and well integrated risk management, internal control and compliance framework.\\\"\\nAPP 4.45. Performance evaluation. The Board should, at least annually, conduct a review of the effectiveness of the Reporting Entity's risk management, internal control and compliance framework and should report to the Shareholders that it has done so. The review should cover all aspects of material controls, including management, financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems. The Board may satisfy this requirement by instructing an external auditor to undertake the review and report to it on its outcome. They should satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust and effective.\\nAPP 4.46. Performance evaluation. The Board should establish formal and transparent arrangements for considering how it should apply the financial reporting and internal control systems, and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with its auditors.\\nAPP 4.47. Performance evaluation. The Board should establish policies and procedures for the identification and oversight and management of material business risks and disclose a summary of those policies and procedures in its annual report. The Board should also ensure that Senior Management implements the requisite risk management and internal control systems to manage material risks.\\n\\nAPP 4.48. Audit committee. The Board should establish and maintain an audit committee to monitor and review the Reporting Entity's internal audit function and other internal controls. The main roles and responsibilities of the audit committee should be set out in written terms of reference, be available on the website of the Reporting Entity and include at least the following:\\na.\\tmonitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Reporting Entity and any Disclosures relating to the Reporting Entity 's financial performance and reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained in them;\\nb.\\treviewing the Reporting Entity's internal financial controls and, unless expressly addressed by a separate risk committee of the Board or the Board itself, internal controls and risk management systems;\\nc.\\tmonitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Reporting Entity's internal audit function;\\nd.\\tmaking recommendations to the Board in respect of the appointment, re appointment, removal and terms of engagement, including remuneration, of the external auditor;\\ne.\\treviewing and monitoring the external auditor's independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process;\\nf.\\tdeveloping and implementing policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non audit services; and\\ng.\\treviewing the adequacy of arrangements by which staff of the Reporting Entity may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters to ensure that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow up action.\\nAPP 4.49. Audit committee. The Board should appoint at least two independent non executive Directors to the audit committee. At least one of the independent non executive Directors appointed to the audit committee should have recent and relevant financial expertise. The chair of the audit committee should be an independent non executive Director.\\nAPP 4.50. Audit committee. A separate section of the annual report should describe the work of the audit committee in discharging its responsibilities. The annual report should also explain to Shareholders how, if the auditor provides non audit services, auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded.\\nPrinciple 5 \\u2013 Shareholder rights and effective dialogue\\nRule 9.2.7\\n\\\"The Board must ensure that the rights of Shareholders are properly safeguarded through appropriate measures that enable the Shareholders to exercise their rights effectively, promote effective dialogue with Shareholders and other key stakeholders as appropriate, and prevent any abuse or oppression of minority Shareholders.\\\"\\nAPP 4.51. Audit committee. The Board as a whole has responsibility for ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue with Shareholders takes place. Such dialogue should be based on the mutual understanding of objectives and provision of adequate information relating to the Reporting Entity including financial information, and how the business and affairs of the Reporting Entity are carried out.\\nAPP 4.52. Audit committee. The Board should hold a general meeting of Shareholders at least annually.\\nAPP 4.53. Audit committee. The Board should use the annual general meeting to communicate with Shareholders on important aspects of the Reporting Entity's business and affairs and encourage their participation. Shareholders should have the opportunity to ask questions of the Board, to place items on the agenda of general meetings and to propose resolutions.\\nAPP 4.54. Audit committee. At any general meeting, the Reporting Entity should propose a separate resolution on each substantial separate issue, and should in particular propose a resolution at the annual general meeting relating to the report and accounts. For each resolution, proxy appointment forms should provide Shareholders with the option to direct their proxy to vote either for or against the resolution or to withhold their vote.\\nAPP 4.55. Audit committee. The chairman should arrange for the chairs of the audit, remuneration, and nomination committees to be available to answer questions at the annual general meeting and for all Directors to attend either in person or by electronic means.\\nAPP 4.56. Audit committee. Whilst recognising that most Shareholder contact is with the chief executive and finance Director, the chairman and other Directors, including non executive Directors as appropriate, should maintain sufficient contact with major Shareholders to understand their issues and concerns. The Board should keep in touch with Shareholder opinion using means which are most practical and efficient taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of its operations and the nature of its Shareholder base. The Board should use its website as a forum for the posting of information such as new strategies and a calendar for important meetings and other events.\\nAPP 4.57. Audit committee. The chairman should ensure that the views of Shareholders are communicated to the Board as a whole. In addition, the chairman should discuss the governance and strategy of the Reporting Entity, at least with its major Shareholders. Non executive Directors should be offered the opportunity to attend meetings with major Shareholders and should expect to attend such meetings, especially if requested by major Shareholders.\\nAPP 4.58. Audit committee. The Board should ensure that no steps are taken which may prevent Shareholders consulting with other Shareholders on issues concerning their basic Shareholder rights, subject to exceptions to prevent abuse. Similarly, the Board should also protect minority Shareholders from any oppressive or abusive action by controlling or major Shareholders.\\n\\nAPP 4.59. Other stakeholders. While Shareholders of the Reporting Entity form the major stakeholder group of the Reporting Entity, the Board should also ensure that there are adequate channels of communication with its other key stakeholders as appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its business operations, and the environment in which it operates. Such stakeholders may include Employees, creditors and business Customers of the Reporting Entity. The Board should make an assessment of the level of information that should generally be made available to the public, or to any particular group of stakeholders, relating to the affairs of the Company, and how best to make use of its website or any other channels of communication as appropriate to disseminate relevant information.\\nPrinciple 6 \\u2013Position and prospects\\nRule 9.2.8\\n\\\"The Board must ensure that the Reporting Entity's financial and other reports present an accurate, balanced and understandable assessment of the Reporting Entity's financial position and prospects by ensuring that there are effective internal risk control and reporting requirements.\\\"\\nAPP 4.60. Other stakeholders. The Board's responsibility to present a true, balanced and understandable assessment of its financial position and prospects should extend to interim and other price sensitive public reports and reports to regulators as well as to information required to be presented by law.\\nAPP 4.61. Other stakeholders. The Directors should explain in the annual financial report their responsibility for preparing that report and accounts, and there should be a statement by the auditor about their reporting responsibilities.\\nAPP 4.62. Other stakeholders. The Directors should include in the annual report an explanation of the basis on which the Reporting Entity generates or preserves value over the longer term (the business model) and the strategy for delivering the objectives of the Reporting Entity.\\nAPP 4.63. Other stakeholders. The Directors should report in annual and half yearly financial statements that the business is a going concern, with supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary.\\nPrinciple 7 \\u2013 Remuneration\\nRule 9.2.9\\n\\\"The Board must ensure that the Reporting Entity has remuneration structures and strategies that are well aligned with the long term interests of the entity.\\\"\\n\\nAPP 4.64. Directors' remuneration. Levels of remuneration of Directors should be sufficient to attract and retain Directors of appropriate quality, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of the business of the Reporting Entity, and to provide effective direction and leadership to the Reporting Entity in managing its business and affairs successfully. In doing so, the Reporting Entity should avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose.\\nAPP 4.65. Directors' remuneration. The performance related elements of remuneration should form an appropriate proportion of the total remuneration package of executive Directors and should be designed to promote the long term interests and viability of the Reporting Entity, to align their interests with those of Shareholders and other key stakeholders and to give these Directors appropriate incentives to perform at the highest levels.\\nAPP 4.66. Directors' remuneration. Levels of remuneration for non executive Directors should reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of their respective roles and the objectivity of judgement in the decision making required by them. In considering whether to grant Share options to non executive Directors, a Reporting Entity should consider whether the granting of the Share options will impair the objectivity or independence of the non executive Directors' decision making.\\nAPP 4.67. Directors' remuneration. Generally, where non executive Directors' remuneration includes Share options, rights resulting from the exercise of Share options should be subject to appropriate retention and vesting periods, generally until at least one year after the non executive Director leaves the Board.\\nAPP 4.68. Directors' remuneration. There should be a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on executive remuneration and for fixing remuneration packages of individual Directors. No Director should decide his own remuneration, and ideally, all Directors' remuneration should be subject to recommendations of any internal remuneration committee, and otherwise upon the advice of an external consultant.\\n\\nAPP 4.69. Remuneration committee. The Board should establish and maintain a remuneration committee to assess the remuneration of Directors (including the chairman). The remuneration committee should comprise at least three members, with a majority of those members being independent non executive Directors. The chair of the committee should be an independent non executive Director. In addition, the chairman of the Board may also be a member but not the chair of the committee.\\nAPP 4.70. Remuneration committee. The remuneration committee should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for all executive Directors and the chairman. The committee should also recommend and monitor the level and structure of remuneration for the Senior Management and other key control functionaries such as the risk or compliance officers and auditors, to ensure that the independence and objectivity of the decision making by such control functionaries is not compromised or impaired by their remuneration structure. An important consideration that should be taken into account in setting remuneration of key control functionaries of the Reporting Entity is that their remuneration is not substantially linked to the profits generated by business or trading units whose activities are subject to monitoring and oversight by those functionaries.\\nAPP 4.71. Remuneration committee. The mandate, composition and working procedures of the remuneration committee should be well defined. The remuneration committee should make available on the website of the Reporting Entity its written terms of reference explaining its role and the authority delegated to it by the Board.\\nAPP 4.72. Remuneration committee. The remuneration committee should also be responsible for appointing any external consultants in respect of executive Directors' remuneration. Where external consultants are appointed, a statement should be made available of whether they have any other connection with the Reporting Entity.\\nAPP 4.73. Remuneration committee. The Board itself, or where required by the articles of association or other constitutional documents, the Shareholders, should determine the remuneration of the non executive Directors.\\nAPP 4.74. Remuneration committee. The annual report of the Reporting Entity should contain sufficient information relating to the overall remuneration policy and strategy of the Reporting Entity to demonstrate that the remuneration, particularly of the executive Directors and Senior Management, properly links rewards to corporate and individual performance and outcomes, and to ensure that any performance based remuneration granted is structured in such a way so as to not induce inappropriate risk taking by such individuals.\\n\\n\"\n",

We have a strong management team with over 20 years of experience in the industry and the management team has contributed significantly to our Company\\u2019s growth and expansion since our incorporation in [year]. We aim to strengthen our position in this industry and region by expanding our operations to [names of countries] in the next 3 years.\\n\\nWe have also recently started a joint venture with [name of company] to enter into the [secondary business] market.

Economic downturns could have an adverse impact on overall demand. This would result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\\n\\n\\u2022\\tOur industry is highly competitive: We compete against numerous businesses and our competitors may be larger and have greater financial resources. We compete for customers, financing, employees and other resources. This creates both strong price and quality competition, which leads to increased costs in the form of marketing and customer services, in addition to price reductions. Our ability to compete effectively depends on several factors, including our market presence, our reputation, our competitors, and general trends in the industry and economy. There is no assurance that we can compete successfully.\\n\\n\\u2022\\tA substantial proportion of our revenues is derived from several major customers and loss of their business may seriously impact our financial results: Our five largest customers accounted for approximately [\\u25cf]% of our revenues for the year ended [year], and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately [\\u25cf]% of our revenues for the year ended [year]. Our revenues may significantly decrease if we lose any of these customers or if our customers reduce their volume of business with us.\\n\\n\\u2022\\tWe face risks associated with our business being conducted in [country]: As most of our operations are conducted in [country], our business may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully manage inherent risks including: unexpected political or economic developments; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unfavourable tax consequences; adverse legal or regulatory changes; insufficient protection for intellectual property rights; and complexities relating to currency and capital transfers.\\n\\n\\u2022\\tThe restrictions on our operating subsidiary\\u2019s ability to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund and operate our business: We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries in [country]. Accordingly, we will rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs, including the necessary funds to pay our operating expenses, service any debt we may incur, and pay any dividends that may be declared. The payment of dividends by [country] entities such as our subsidiaries is subject to limitations in accordance with the rules and regulations of [country], which may negatively affect our operations and profitability.\\n\\nThe above are not the only risk factors that had a material effect or could have a material effect on our business operations, financial position and results, and your shares. Refer to \\u201c[relevant section]\\u201d on page(s) [\\u25cf] of the Offer document for a discussion on other risk factors and for more information on the above risk factors.

Shareholders will be entitled to all rights attached to their shares in proportion to their shareholding, such as any cash dividends declared by the Company and any distribution of assets upon liquidation of the Company. There are no restrictions on the transferability of our shares.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRefer to the \\u201c[relevant section]\\u201d on page(s) [\\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information.\\n\\nHOW WILL THE PROCEEDS OF THE OFFER BE USED?\\n[Provide information on the amount of proceeds raised from the offer will be allocated to each principal intended use. Information on the use of proceeds should be presented using diagrams (e.g. tables, graphs and charts) where appropriate.]\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nUse of Proceeds\\n\\nThe net proceeds to be raised in the offer (after deducting estimated expenses to be borne by us) is $[\\u25cf]. The following represents our estimate of the allocation of the gross proceeds expected to be raised from the offer, assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised.

Provide clear and prominent disclosure of any existing or proposed arrangement that materially enhances short-term yields while potentially diluting long-term yields. The disclosure should include a computation of the forecast distribution yield assuming that the arrangements are not in place.]\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nOver the last three financial years ended 31 December [year], [year] and [year], we have not declared and distributed dividends. We currently do not have a fixed dividend policy. Any future payment of dividends by us would depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors. If we do not pay any dividends, any return on investment may be limited to the value of our shares, and our shares may be less valuable because return on investment will depend entirely on capital appreciation.\\nRefer to the \\u201c[relevant section]\\u201d on page(s) [\\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information on our [dividend / distribution] policy.\\nDEFINITIONS\\n[Provide definitions if necessary.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTACT INFORMATION\\nWHO CAN YOU CONTACT IF YOU HAVE ENQUIRIES RELATING TO OUR OFFER?\\nHOW DO YOU CONTACT US?\\n[Provide contact details of Issuer, distributor(s)/underwriter(s) and/or issue manager(s) whom investors can contact if they have enquiries.
