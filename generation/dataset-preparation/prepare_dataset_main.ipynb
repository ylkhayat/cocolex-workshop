The U.A.E. criminal law applies in the ADGM and, therefore, Persons in the ADGM must be aware of their obligations in respect of the criminal law as well as these Rules. Relevant U.A.E. criminal laws include Federal AML Legislation and Federal Law No. (31) of 2021 (the Penal Code of the United Arab Emirates (\\u201cU.A.E.\\u201d)). The Rules in the AML Rulebook should not be relied upon to interpret or determine the application of the criminal laws of the U.A.E.\\n2.Guidance.2. Federal AML Legislation applies in the ADGM.

It includes all federal legislation as may be in force relating to money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing, the financing of unlawful organisations and sanctions compliance including Targeted Financial Sanctions.  Particular pieces of legislation to be aware of include:\\n(a)\\tFederal Law No. (7) of 2014 regarding Combatting Terrorism Offences;\\n(b)\\tFederal Decree Law No. (20) of 2018 on Anti-Money Laundering, Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations;\\n(c)\\tCabinet Decision No. (10) of 2019 concerning the Implementing Regulation of Decree Law No. (20) of 2018;\\n(d)\\tCabinet Decision No. (74) of 2020 concerning the Terrorism Lists Regulation and Implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions on the Suppression and Combatting of Terrorism, Terrorist Financing, Countering the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and its Financing and Relevant Resolutions.\\n2.Guidance.3. The AML Rulebook has been designed to provide a primary reference point for Relevant Persons that are supervised by the Regulator for AML/TFS compliance in accordance with the scope of application outlined in Rule \\u200e1.2.1. Accordingly it applies to all Relevant Persons, but to different degrees as provided in Rule \\u200e1.2.1(2). The AML Rulebook takes into consideration the fact that Relevant Persons have differing money laundering risk profiles. A Relevant Person should familiarise itself with the AML Rulebook and assess the extent to which the Chapters and sections apply to it. Relevant Persons should also ensure they are aware of, and take into account, all notices issued by the Regulator as well as relevant guidance and guidelines issued by governmental authorities in the U.A.E.\\n2.Guidance.4. The AML Rulebook is not intended to be read in isolation from other U.A.E. relevant legislation or developments in international policy and best practice. To the extent applicable, Relevant Persons need to be aware of, and\"\n",

This is particularly relevant when considering the Local Terrorist List and the United Nations Security Council (\\\"UNSC\\\") Resolutions which apply in the ADGM, and Sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions which may apply to a Relevant Person depending on the Relevant Person's jurisdiction of origin, its business and/or customer base.\\n2.Guidance.5. Chapter \\u200e1 specifies who is ultimately responsible for a Relevant Person's compliance with the AML Rulebook. The Regulator expects the Governing Body and Senior Management of a Relevant Person to establish a robust and effective AML/TFS compliance culture for the business.\\n2.Guidance.6. Chapter \\u200e2 provides an overview of the AML Rulebook and Chapter \\u200e3 sets out the key definitions in the AML Rulebook.\\n2.Guidance.7. Chapter \\u200e4 outlines the general compliance requirements including Group policies, notifications, record-keeping requirements and the annual AML Return.\\n2.Guidance.8. Chapter \\u200e5 explains the meaning of the risk-based approach (\\\"RBA\\\"), which should be applied when complying with the AML Rulebook. The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \\u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \\u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\\\"CDD\\\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \\u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is\"\n",

This overlap may occur at the initial stages of onboarding of customers but may also occur when undertaking ongoing CDD.\\n2.Guidance.9. Chapter \\u200e9 sets out where a Relevant Person may rely on a third party to undertake all or some of its CDD obligations. Reliance on third-party CDD reduces the need to duplicate CDD already performed for a customer. Alternatively, a Relevant Person may outsource some or all of its CDD obligations to a service provider.\\n2.Guidance.10. Chapter \\u200e10 sets out certain obligations in relation to correspondent banking, wire transfers and other matters which are limited to Authorised Persons, other than a Credit Rating Agency, and Recognised Bodies and, in particular, to banks.\\n2.Guidance.11. Chapter \\u200e11 sets out a Relevant Person's obligations in relation to both Sanctions issued by the UNSC and other Sanctions, and government, regulatory and international findings in relation to money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of weapons of mass destruction (\\u201cWMD\\u201d).\\n2.Guidance.12. Chapter \\u200e12 sets out the obligation for a Relevant Person to appoint an MLRO and the responsibilities of such a Person.\\n2.Guidance.13. Chapter \\u200e13 sets out the requirements for AML/TFS training and awareness. A Relevant Person should adopt the RBA when complying with Chapter \\u200e13, so as to make its training and awareness proportionate to the money laundering risks of the business and the role of the relevant Employee(s).\\n2.Guidance.14. Chapter \\u200e14 contains the obligations applying to all Relevant Persons concerning Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports, which are required to be made under Federal AML Legislation.\\n2.Guidance.15.

Rule \\u200e5.1.1 requires a Relevant Person to adopt an approach to AML/TFS which is proportionate to the risks. This is called the \\\"risk-based approach\\\" (\\\"RBA\\\"). The Regulator expects the RBA to be a key part of the Relevant Person's AML/TFS compliance culture and to cascade down from the Senior Management to the rest of the organisation. Embedding the RBA within its business allows a Relevant Person to make decisions and allocate AML/TFS resources in the most efficient and effective way.\\n5.1.1.Guidance.2. In implementing the RBA, a Relevant Person is expected to have in place processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate money laundering risks. The general principle is that where there are higher risks of money laundering, a Relevant Person is required to take enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks. Correspondingly, when the risks are lower, simplified measures are permitted. Simplified measures are not permitted where there is a suspicion of money laundering.\\n5.1.1.Guidance.3. The RBA should not be seen as a \\\"tick-box\\\" approach to AML/TFS. Instead a Relevant Person is required to assess relevant money laundering risks and adopt a proportionate response to such risks, however, even where a customer is assessed through the RBA as being low-risk a minimum of simplified CDD must be undertaken in relation to that customer.\\n5.1.1.Guidance.4.

Unless a Relevant Person understands the money laundering risks to which it is exposed, it cannot take appropriate steps to prevent its business from being used for the purposes of money laundering. Money laundering risks vary from business to business depending on the nature of the business, the type of customers a business has, the nature of the products and services sold, and the geographical operations in which it operates.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.2. Using the RBA, a Relevant Person should assess its own vulnerabilities to money laundering and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks. The results of this assessment will also feed into the Relevant Person's risk assessment of its customers under Chapter \\u200e7.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.3. In addition to assessing risk arising from money laundering, a business risk assessment should assess the potential exposure of a Relevant Person to other Financial Crime, such as fraud and the theft of personal data. The business risk assessment should also address the Relevant Person\\u2019s potential exposure to cyber security risk, as this risk may have a material impact on the Relevant Person\\u2019s ability to prevent Financial Crime.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.4.

A Relevant Person should, prior to launching any new product, service or business practice, pay specific attention to assessing the potential for risks associated with all applicable aspects of Financial Crime. This is especially important given the innovative nature of any such new offering as the Relevant Person may be less familiar with the functioning of the offering, compared to existing offerings.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.6. Similarly, in using a new or developing technology, such as those associated with the Regulated Activity of Developing Financial Technology Services within the RegLab or when undertaking NFTF business, a Relevant Person should pay specific attention to assessing the potential for risks associated with Financial Crime that might arise as a result of implementing that innovative technology. For example, while the use of eKYC Systems may reduce the risk of impersonation fraud at customer onboarding, NFTF interaction with the customer may increase the risk of Financial Crime after a business relationship has been established, through transaction fraud, money laundering or theft of digitally stored CDD documentation.\\n6.1.3.Guidance.7. A business risk assessment under Rule \\u200e6.1.1(b) should include an assessment of the risks associated with the carrying on of NFTF business, particularly the use of eKYC Systems. The assessment should consider incorporating any relevant mitigation measures identified by the Regulator, a competent authority of the U.A.E., FATF, and any other relevant bodies.\\n\\n\\n6.2 AML/TFS systems and controls\\n6.2.1 A Relevant Person must:\\n(a)\\testablish and maintain effective policies, procedures, systems and controls to prevent opportunities for money laundering in relation to the Relevant Person and its activities;\\n(b)\\tensure that its systems and controls in (a):\\n(i)\\tinclude the provision\"\n",

In Rule \\u200e6.2.1(c) the frequency of risk assessments will depend on the nature, size and complexity of the Relevant Person's business and also on when any material changes are made to its business. The risk assessments should also take into account a range of financial crime, including fraud, bribery and corruption.\\n6.2.1.Guidance.2. The risk assessment under Rule \\u200e6.2.1(c) should identify actions to mitigate risks associated with undertaking NFTF business generally, and the use of eKYC specifically. This is because distinct risks are often likely to arise where business is conducted entirely in an NFTF manner, compared to when the business relationship includes a mix of face-to-face and NFTF interactions. The assessment should make reference to risk mitigation measures recommended by the Regulator, a competent authority of the U.A.E., FATF, and other relevant bodies.\\n\\n\\n7. CUSTOMER RISK ASSESSMENT\\n7.Guidance\\n7.Guidance.1. This Chapter prescribes the risk-based assessment that must be undertaken by a Relevant Person on a customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product. The outcome of this process is to produce a risk rating for a customer, which determines the level of CDD\"\n",

      "        \"1\",\n",

Chapter \\u200e8 prescribes the requirements of CDD, Enhanced CDD for high-risk customers and, where appropriate, Simplified CDD for low-risk customers.\\n7.Guidance.2. CDD in the context of AML/TFS refers to the process of identifying a customer, verifying such identification and monitoring the customer's business and the potential for any money laundering risk on an ongoing basis. CDD is required to be completed following a risk-based assessment of the customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product.\\n7.Guidance.3. Relevant Persons should note that the ongoing CDD requirements in Rule \\u200e\\u200e8.6.1 require a Relevant Person to review a customer's risk rating to ensure that it remains appropriate in light of the potential money laundering risks.\\n7.Guidance.4. The risk-based assessment of the customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product required under this Chapter is required to be undertaken prior to the establishment of a business relationship with a customer. Because the risk rating assigned to a customer resulting from this assessment determines the level of CDD that must be undertaken for that customer, this process must be completed before the CDD is completed for the customer. The Regulator is aware that in practice there will often be some degree of overlap between the customer risk assessment and CDD. For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment. Where information obtained as part of CDD of a customer affects the risk rating of a customer, the change in risk rating should be reflected in the degree of CDD undertaken.\\n7.1 Assessing the money laundering risks of\"\n",

This risk also extends to members of their families and to known close associates. Being a PEP does not, in itself, of course, incriminate individuals or entities.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.2. Generally, a foreign PEP presents a higher risk of money laundering because there is a greater risk that such a Person, if he were undertaking money laundering, would attempt to place his money offshore, away from his home jurisdiction, where he is less likely to be recognised as a PEP and where it would be more difficult for law enforcement agencies in his home jurisdiction to confiscate or freeze his criminal proceeds.\\n8.3.6.Guidance on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and corruption.3.

The fact that an individual is a PEP does not automatically mean that the individual must be assessed to be a high-risk customer: however, Enhanced CDD still needs to be undertaken on PEPs.

The Regulator considers that verification of Source of Funds includes obtaining independent corroborating evidence such as the proof of dividend payments connected to a shareholding, bank statements, salary/bonus certificates, loan documentation and proof of all Transactions which gave rise to payments into the account. A customer should be able to demonstrate and have documented how the relevant funds are connected to a particular event which gave rise to the payment into the account or to the source of the funds for a Transaction.\\n8.4.1.Guidance.7.

The Regulator would expect that such consultation does not prevent making a report whenever an Employee has stated that he has knowledge, suspicion or reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that a Person may be involved in money laundering. Whether or not an Employee consults with his line manager or other Employees, the responsibility remains with the Employee to decide for himself whether a notification to the MLRO should be made.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.6.

Activity or Transactions that appear unusual are not necessarily suspicious. Even customers with a stable and predictable Transaction profile will have periodic Transactions that are unusual for them. Many customers will, for perfectly good reasons, have an erratic pattern of Transactions or account activity. So the unusual is, in the first instance, only a basis for further inquiry, which may in turn require judgement as to whether it is suspicious.

If a Relevant Person reasonably believes that performing CDD measures will tip off a customer or potential customer, it may choose not to pursue that process and should file a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report. Relevant Persons should ensure that their Employees are aware of and sensitive to these issues when considering the CDD measures.\\n14.5 Record-keeping\\n14.5.1 All relevant details of any notification to the MLRO under Rule \\u200e14.2 or Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports filed pursuant to Rule \\u200e14.3 must be kept for at least six years from the date on which the report was made.\\n14.6 Freezing of assets\\n14.6.Guidance \\nThe Regulator has certain powers under FSMR to impose a requirement restricting an Authorised Person or Recognised Body from disposing of or transferring property including, for example, assets or other funds suspected of relating to money laundering. It may also apply to the ADGM Courts for an order restraining a Person from transferring or disposing of any assets suspected of relating to money laundering or terrorist financing. In cases involving suspected money laundering or terrorist financing, the Regulator will usually take such action in coordination with the FIU.\\n\\n\\n15. DNFBP REGISTRATION AND SUPERVISION\\n15.Guidance\\n15.Guidance.1. FSMR gives the Regulator the power to supervise DNFBPs\\u2019 compliance with relevant Federal AML Legislation. FSMR also gives the Regulator a number of other powers in relation to DNFBPs, including powers of enforcement.

It may also suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP in various circumstances.\\n15.Guidance.2. The Regulator takes a risk-based approach to regulation of persons which it supervises. Generally, the Regulator will work with DNFBPs to identify, assess, mitigate and control relevant risks where appropriate. The Guidance & Policies Manual (\\u201cGPM\\u201d) describes the Regulator\\u2019s enforcement powers under FSMR and outlines its policy for using these powers.\\n15.Guidance.3. Rule \\u200e15.1.1 requires a DNFBP to be registered by the Regulator to conduct its activities in the ADGM. Rule \\u200e15.2.1 sets out the criteria a DNFBP must meet to be registered. The Regulator may suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP where the DNFBP no longer meets the criteria for registration.\\n15.Guidance.4. A DNFBP is defined in Rule \\u200e3.2.1 and includes the following class of persons whose business is carried out in the ADGM:\\n(a)\\ta real estate agency which carries out transactions with other Persons that involve the acquiring or disposing of real property;\\n(b)\\ta dealer in precious metals or precious stones;\\n(c)\\ta dealer in any saleable item of a price equal to or greater than USD15,000;\\n(d)\\tan accounting firm, audit firm, insolvency firm or taxation consulting firm;\\n(e)\\ta law firm, notary firm or other independent legal business; or\\n(f)\\ta Company Service Provider.\\n15.Guidance.5. In determining if a Person is a DNFPB the Regulator will adopt a \\u2018substance over form\\u2019 approach. That is, it will consider what business or profession is in fact being carried on, and its main characteristics, and not just what business or profession the Person purports, or is licensed, to carry on in the ADGM.\\n15.Guidance.6. The Regulator considers that a \\u201claw firm, notary firm or other independent legal business, includes any business or profession that involves a legal service, including advice or\"\n",

      "\"1\\n14. SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY/TRANSACTION REPORTS\\n14.1 Application and definitions\\nIn this Chapter \\\"money laundering\\\" and \\u201cterrorist financing\\\" means the criminal offences defined in Federal AML Legislation.\\n14.2 Internal reporting requirements\\n14.2.1 A Relevant Person must establish and maintain policies, procedures, systems and controls in order to monitor and detect suspicious activity or Transactions in relation to potential money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.2.2 A Relevant Person must have policies, procedures, systems and controls to ensure that whenever any Employee, acting in the ordinary course of his employment, either:\\n(a)\\tknows;\\n(b)\\tsuspects; or\\n(c)\\thas reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting,\\nthat a Person is engaged in or attempting money laundering or terrorist financing, that Employee promptly notifies the Relevant Person's MLRO and provides the MLRO with all relevant details.\\n14.2.3 A Relevant Person must have policies and procedures to ensure that disciplinary action can be taken against any Employee who fails to make such a report.\\n14.2.3.Guidance\\n14.2.3.Guidance.1. Circumstances that might give rise to suspicion or reasonable grounds for suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing include:\\n(a)\\tTransactions which have no apparent purpose, which make no obvious economic sense, or which are designed or structured to avoid detection;\\n(b)\\tTransactions requested by a Person without reasonable explanation, which are out of the ordinary range of services normally requested or are outside the experience of a Relevant Person in relation to a particular customer;\\n(c)\\twhere the size or pattern of Transactions, without reasonable explanation, is out of line with any pattern that has previously emerged or may have been deliberately structured to avoid detection;\\n(d)\\ta customer's refusal to provide the information requested without reasonable explanation;\\n(e)\\twhere a customer who has just entered into a business relationship uses the relationship for a single Transaction or for only a very short period of time;\\n(f)\\textensive use of offshore accounts, companies or structures in circumstances where the customer's economic needs do not support such requirements;\\n(g)\\tunnecessary routing of funds through third-party accounts; or\\n(h)\\tunusual Transactions without an apparently profitable motive.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.2. CDD measures form the basis for recognising suspicious activity or Transactions. Sufficient guidance must therefore be given to the Relevant Person's Employees to enable them to form a suspicion or to recognise when they have reasonable grounds to suspect that money laundering or terrorist financing is taking place. This should involve training that will enable relevant Employees to seek and assess the information that is required for them to judge whether a Person is involved in suspicious activity or Transactions related to money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.3. Where appropriate, a Relevant Person should also utilise the methods described in paragraph 1 above to detect a range of Financial Crimes, including fraud. Bearing in mind the evolving nature of Financial Crime and the methods used to further it, a Relevant Person should apply best practice when determining which behaviours would be considered suspicious and what measures are required to detect suspicious activity and Transactions. Such practices may include, but are not limited to, incorporating the analysis of customer behaviour metrics into the monitoring of suspicious activity and Transactions.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.4. The requirement for Employees to notify the Relevant Person's MLRO should include situations when no business relationship was developed because the circumstances were suspicious.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.5. A Relevant Person may allow its Employees to consult with their line managers before sending a report to the MLRO. The Regulator would expect that such consultation does not prevent making a report whenever an Employee has stated that he has knowledge, suspicion or reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that a Person may be involved in money laundering. Whether or not an Employee consults with his line manager or other Employees, the responsibility remains with the Employee to decide for himself whether a notification to the MLRO should be made.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.6. An Employee, including the MLRO, who considers that a Person has engaged in or is engaging in activity or Transactions that he knows or suspects to be suspicious would not be expected to know the exact nature of the criminal offence or that the particular funds were definitely those arising from the crime of money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.7. Activity or Transactions that appear unusual are not necessarily suspicious. Even customers with a stable and predictable Transaction profile will have periodic Transactions that are unusual for them. Many customers will, for perfectly good reasons, have an erratic pattern of Transactions or account activity. So the unusual is, in the first instance, only a basis for further inquiry, which may in turn require judgement as to whether it is suspicious. A Transaction or activity may not be suspicious at the time, but if suspicions are raised later, an obligation to report it then arises.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.8. Effective CDD measures may provide the basis for recognising unusual and suspicious activity and Transactions. Refusal to provide documentation to support CDD or refusal to disclose a beneficial owner may be considered suspicious activity. Where there is a customer relationship, suspicious activity will often be one that is inconsistent with a customer's known legitimate activity, or with the normal business activities for that type of account or customer. Therefore, the key to recognising \\\"suspicious activity\\\" is knowing enough about the customer and the customer's normal expected activities to recognise when their activity is abnormal.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.9. A Relevant Person may consider implementing policies and procedures whereby disciplinary action is taken against an Employee who fails to notify the Relevant Person's MLRO.\\n14.2.3.Guidance.10. Relevant Persons should comply with guidance issued by the EOCN with regard to identifying and reporting suspicious activity and Transactions relating to money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.\\n14.3 Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports\\n14.3.1 A Relevant Person must ensure that where the Relevant Person's MLRO receives an internal notification of suspicious activity under Rule \\u200e14.2.2, the MLRO, without delay:\\n(a)\\tinvestigates and documents the circumstances in relation to which the notification made under Rule \\u200e14.2.2 was made;\\n(b)\\tdetermines whether in accordance with Federal AML Legislation a SAR/STR must be made and documents such determination; and\\n(c)\\tif required, make a SAR/STR as soon as practicable.\\n14.3.2 The MLRO must, following receipt of an internal notification of suspicious activity under Rule \\u200e14.2.2, document:\\n(a)\\tthe steps taken to investigate the circumstances in relation to which the internal notification is made; and\\n(b)\\twhere no external SAR/STR is made, the reasons why no such report was made.\\n14.3.3 Where, following a notification to the MLRO of suspicious activity under \\u200e14.2.2, no SAR/STR is made, a Relevant Person must record the reasons for not making a SAR/STR.\\n14.3.4 A Relevant Person must ensure that if the MLRO decides to make a SAR/STR, his decision is made independently and is not subject to the consent or approval of any other Person.\\n14.3.5 Relevant Persons are required to register on goAML upon receipt of their Financial Services Permission, Recognition Order or registration licence in order to submit SAR/STRs.\\n14.3.5.Guidance\\n14.3.5.Guidance.1. Relevant Persons are reminded that the failure to report suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing may constitute a criminal offence that is punishable under the laws of the U.A.E.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.2. Relevant Persons should comply with guidance issued by the EOCN regarding reporting suspicious activity and Transactions relating to money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.3. SARs/STRs under Federal AML Legislation should be submitted to the FIU via goAML. The dedicated mechanism for registering and reporting on goAML is available on the Regulator\\u2019s website. Failure to register on goAML may lead to the Regulator taking action.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.4. In the preparation of a SAR/STR, if a Relevant Person knows or assumes that the funds which form the subject of the report do not belong to a customer but to a third party, this fact and the details of the Relevant Person's proposed course of further action in relation to the case should be included in the report.\\n14.3.5.Guidance.5. If a Relevant Person has filed a SAR/STR, the FIU may instruct the Relevant Person on how to continue its business relationship, including effecting any Transaction with a Person. If the customer in question expresses his wish to move the funds before the Relevant Person receives instruction from the FIU on how to proceed, the Relevant Person should immediately contact the FIU for further instructions.\\n14.4 Suspension of Transactions and \\u201cno tipping-off\\u201d requirement\\n14.4.1 A Relevant Person must not carry out Transactions that it knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting to be related to money laundering or terrorist financing until it has informed the FIU pursuant to Rule \\u200e14.3.1.\\n14.4.1.Guidance\\n14.4.1.Guidance.1. Relevant Persons are reminded that in accordance with Federal AML Legislation, Relevant Persons or any of their Employees must not tip off any Person, that is, inform any Person that he is being scrutinised, or investigated by any other competent authority, for possible involvement in suspicious Transactions or activity related to money laundering or terrorist financing.\\n14.4.1.Guidance.2. If a Relevant Person reasonably believes that performing CDD measures will tip off a customer or potential customer, it may choose not to pursue that process and should file a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report. Relevant Persons should ensure that their Employees are aware of and sensitive to these issues when considering the CDD measures.\\n14.5 Record-keeping\\n14.5.1 All relevant details of any notification to the MLRO under Rule \\u200e14.2 or Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports filed pursuant to Rule \\u200e14.3 must be kept for at least six years from the date on which the report was made.\\n14.6 Freezing of assets\\n14.6.Guidance \\nThe Regulator has certain powers under FSMR to impose a requirement restricting an Authorised Person or Recognised Body from disposing of or transferring property including, for example, assets or other funds suspected of relating to money laundering. It may also apply to the ADGM Courts for an order restraining a Person from transferring or disposing of any assets suspected of relating to money laundering or terrorist financing. In cases involving suspected money laundering or terrorist financing, the Regulator will usually take such action in coordination with the FIU.\\n\\n\"\n"

AML/TFS COMPLIANCE AND THIRD PARTIES\\n9.1 Reliance on a third party\\n9.1.1\\n9.1.1.(1) A Relevant Person may rely on the following third parties to conduct one or more of the elements of CDD on its behalf:\\n(a)\\tan Authorised Person or Recognised Body;\\n(b)\\ta law firm, notary, or other independent legal business, accounting firm, audit firm or insolvency practitioner or an equivalent Person in another jurisdiction;\\n(c)\\ta Financial Institution;\\n(d)\\ta member of the Relevant Person's Group; or\\n(e)\\tother specialised utilities for the provision of outsourced AML/TFS services.\\n9.1.1.(2) In (1), a Relevant Person may rely on the information previously obtained by a third party which covers one or more elements of CDD.\\n9.1.1.(3) Where a Relevant Person seeks to rely on a Person in (1) it may only do so if and to the extent that:\\n(a)\\tit immediately obtains the necessary CDD information from the third party in (1);\\n(b)\\tit takes adequate steps to satisfy itself that certified copies of the documents used to undertake the relevant elements of CDD will be available from the third party on request without delay;\\n(c)\\tthe Person in (1)(b) to (d) is subject to regulation, including AML/TFS compliance requirements, by a Non-ADGM Financial Services Regulator or other competent authority in a country with AML/TFS regulations which are equivalent to the standards set out in the FATF Recommendations and it is supervised for compliance with such regulations;\\n(d)\\tthe Person in (1) has not relied on any exception from the requirement to conduct any relevant elements of CDD which the Relevant Person seeks to rely on; and\\n(e)\\tin relation to (2), the information is up to date.\\n9.1.1.(4) Where a Relevant Person relies on a member of its Group to conduct one or more of the elements of CDD on its behalf, such Group member need not meet the condition in (3)(c) if:\\n(a)\\tthe Group is subject to policies and requirements equivalent to FATF standards, either:\\n(i)\\twhere the Group applies and implements a Group-wide policy on CDD and record-keeping which is equivalent to the standards set by FATF; or\\n(ii)\\twhere the effective implementation of those CDD and record-keeping requirements and AML/TFS programmes are supervised at Group level by a Non-ADGM Financial Services Regulator or other competent authority in a jurisdiction with AML/TFS regulations that are equivalent to the standards set out in the FATF Recommendations;\\n(b)\\tno exception from identification obligations has been applied in the original identification process; and\\n(c)\\ta written statement is received from the introducing member of the Relevant Person's Group confirming that:\\n(i)\\tthe customer has been identified in accordance with the relevant standards under (4)(a) and (b);\\n(ii)\\tany identification evidence can be accessed by the Relevant Person without delay; and\\n(iii)\\tthe identification evidence will be kept for at least six years.\\n9.1.1.(5) If a Relevant Person is not reasonably satisfied that a customer or Beneficial Owners has been identified and verified by a third party in a manner consistent with these Rules, the Relevant Person must immediately perform the CDD itself with respect to any deficiencies identified.\\n(6)\\tNotwithstanding the Relevant Person's reliance on a Person in \\u200e9.1.1(1), the Relevant Person remains responsible for compliance with, and liable for any failure to meet the CDD requirements in the AML Rulebook.\\n9.1.2\\n9.1.2.(1) When assessing under Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3) or (4) if AML/TFS regulations in another jurisdiction are equivalent to FATF standards, a Relevant Person must take into account factors including, but not limited to:\\n(a)\\tmutual evaluations, assessment reports or follow-up reports published by FATF, the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD or other International Organisations;\\n(b)\\tmembership of FATF or other international or regional groups such as the MENAFATF or the Gulf Co-operation Council;\\n(c)\\tcontextual factors such as political stability or the level of corruption in the jurisdiction;\\n(d)\\tevidence of recent criticism of the jurisdiction, including in:\\n(i)\\tFATF advisory notices;\\n(ii)\\tpublic assessments of the jurisdiction\\u2019s AML/TFS regimes by organisations referred to in (a); or\\n(iii)\\treports by other relevant non-government organisations or specialist commercial organisations;\\n(e)\\twhether adequate arrangements exist for co-operation between the AML/TFS regulator in that jurisdiction and the Regulator.\\n9.1.2.(2) A Relevant Person making an assessment under (1) must rely only on sources of information that are reliable and up to date.\\n9.1.2.(3) A Relevant Person must keep adequate records of how it made its assessment, including the sources and materials considered.\\n9.1.2.Guidance\\n9.1.2.Guidance.1. In complying with Rule \\u200e\\u200e9.1.1(3)(a), \\\"immediately obtaining the necessary CDD information\\\" means obtaining all relevant CDD information, and not just basic information such as name and address. However, compliance can be achieved by having the information sent in an email or other appropriate means. For the avoidance of doubt, it does not necessarily require a Relevant Person to immediately obtain the underlying certified documents used by the third party to undertake its CDD because under Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3)(b), these need only be available on request without delay.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.2. The Regulator would expect a Relevant Person, in complying with Rule \\u200e\\u200e9.1.1(5), to fill any gaps in the CDD process as soon as it becomes aware that a customer or Beneficial Owners has not been identified and verified by the third party in a manner consistent with these Rules.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.3. If a Relevant Person acquires another business, either in whole or in substantial part, the Regulator would permit the Relevant Person to rely on the CDD conducted by the business it is acquiring, but would expect the Relevant Person to have done the following:\\n(a)\\tas part of its due diligence for the acquisition, to have taken a reasonable sample of the prospective customers to assess the quality of the CDD undertaken; and\\n(b)\\tto have undertaken CDD on all the customers to cover any deficiencies identified in (a) as soon as possible following the acquisition, prioritising high-risk customers.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.4. Where the legislative framework of a jurisdiction (such as secrecy or data protection legislation) prevents a Relevant Person from having access to CDD information upon request without delay as referred to in Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3)(b), the Relevant Person should undertake the relevant CDD itself and should not seek to rely on the relevant third party.\\n9.1.2.Guidance.5. If a Relevant Person relies on a third party located in a foreign jurisdiction to conduct one or more elements of CDD on its behalf, the Relevant Person must ensure that the foreign jurisdiction has AML/TFS regulations which are equivalent to the standards in the FATF Recommendations (see Rule \\u200e9.1.1(3)(c)).\\n9.1.2.Guidance.6. Relevant Persons should follow directives issued by the NAMLCFTC. For example, Relevant Persons are prohibited from using third parties located in Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action to perform CDD.\\n9.2 Business partner identification\\n9.2.1\\n9.2.1.(1) Prior to establishing the business relationship, a Relevant Person must establish and verify the identity of its business partners by obtaining sufficient and satisfactory evidence of the identity of any business partner it relies upon in carrying on its Regulated Activities.\\n(a)\\tA Relevant Person must maintain accurate and up-to-date information and conduct ongoing due diligence on its business partners, throughout the course of the business relationship.\\n(b)\\tIf at any time a Relevant Person becomes aware that it lacks sufficient information or documentation concerning a business partner's identification, or develops a concern about the accuracy of its current information or documentation, it must promptly obtain appropriate material to verify such business partner's identity.\\n9.2.1.(2) In the context of this Rule, a 'business partner' includes:\\n(a)\\ta third party as specified in Rule \\u200e9.1.1(1);\\n(b)\\ta member of the Relevant Person's Group;\\n(c)\\ta Correspondent Bank; or\\n(d)\\tany other service provider.\\n9.2.1.(3) A Relevant Person that establishes, operates or maintains a Correspondent Account for a Correspondent Banking Client must ensure that it has arrangements to:\\n(a)\\tconduct due diligence in respect of the opening of a Correspondent Account for a Correspondent Banking Client, including measures to identify:\\n(i)\\tits ownership and management structure;\\n(ii)\\tits major business activities and customer base;\\n(iii)\\tits location; and\\n(iv)\\tthe intended purpose of the Correspondent Account;\\n(b)\\tidentify all third parties that will use the Correspondent Account; and\\n(c)\\tmonitor Transactions processed through a Correspondent Account that has been opened by a Correspondent Banking Client, in order to detect and report any suspicion of money laundering.\\n9.2.1.Guidance \\nUnder (2)(d), service providers include agents that directly facilitate the activities of Authorised Persons in servicing their clients, as distinct from other service providers that provide purely ancillary services, such as IT, facilities management etc. to an Authorised Person.\\n9.2.2 A Relevant Person must not:\\n9.2.2.(1) establish a correspondent banking relationship with a Shell Bank;\\n9.2.2.(2) establish or keep anonymous accounts or accounts in false names; or\\n9.2.2.(3) maintain a nominee account which is held in the name of one Person, but controlled by or held for the benefit of another Person whose identity has not been disclosed to the Relevant Person.\\n9.2.2.Guidance\\n9.2.2.Guidance.1. \\\"Know your business partner\\\" is as important as \\\"Know Your Customer\\\". A Relevant Person is therefore required to verify the identity of a prospective business partner and to obtain evidence of it. The same documentation that is used to identify customers should be obtained from the business partner prior to conducting any business.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.2. A Relevant Person should verify whether any secrecy or data protection law exists in the country of incorporation of the business partner that would prevent access to relevant data.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.3. The requirement to identify the business partner is meant to cover only those business partners who may pose any relevant money laundering risks to the Relevant Person. Hence, a Relevant Person would not be required to establish and verify the identity of, for example, its maintenance or cleaning service.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.4. The Regulator may take into account the identity of a Relevant Person's business partner and the nature of their relationship in considering the fitness and propriety of a Relevant Person.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.5. Before entering into a business relationship, a Relevant Person should conduct a due diligence investigation, which includes ensuring that the business partner is an existing Person authorised to conduct the kind of business in question and, if applicable, verifying that this Person is duly regulated by a Financial Services Regulator or other relevant regulatory authority or regulator. In accordance with \\\"The Wolfsberg Anti-Money Laundering Principles for Correspondent Banking\\\", the Relevant Person should take into account, and verify the nature of:\\n(a)\\tthe business to be conducted and the major business activities of the business partner;\\n(b)\\tthe jurisdiction where the business partner is located as well as that of its parent; and\\n(c)\\tthe transparency and the nature of the ownership and the management structure.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.6. A Relevant Person may also gather information about the reputation of the business partner, including whether it has been subject to investigation or regulatory action in relation to money laundering.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.7. A Relevant Person should adopt a risk-based approach when verifying its business partners' identities. Depending on the money laundering risks assessment of the Relevant Person's business partner, the Relevant Person should decide the level of detail of the business partner identification and verification process.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.8. A Relevant Person should have in place specific arrangements to ensure that adequate due diligence and identification measures with regard to the business relationship are taken.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.9. The Relevant Person should conduct regular reviews of the relationship with its business partners.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.10. The Senior Management or Governing Body of a Relevant Person should give its approval before it establishes any new correspondent banking relationships.\\n9.2.2.Guidance.11. A Relevant Person should also have arrangements to guard against establishing a business relationship with business partners who permit their accounts to be used by Shell Banks; further details on the definition of Shell Banks are set out in Guidance 2 to Rule \\u200e10.2.2.\\n9.3 Outsourcing and agents\\n9.3.1 A Relevant Person which outsources any one or more elements of its CDD to a service provider (including those within its Group) remains responsible for compliance with, and liable for any failure to meet, such obligations.\\n9.3.1A Prior to appointing a service provider to undertake CDD, a Relevant Person must undertake an initial assurance assessment to evaluate the suitability of the service provider and must ensure that the service provider's obligations are clearly documented in a binding agreement.\\n9.3.1B After engaging a service provider the Relevant Person must undertake periodic assurance assessments to ensure that the services provided meet the obligations recorded in the binding agreement and allow it to meet all the requirements that it is subject to.\\n\\n9.3.1B.Guidance\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.1. The use by a Relevant Person of a service provider\\u2019s eKYC System that enables a Relevant Person to undertake eKYC constitutes outsourcing for the purposes of Rule \\u200e9.3.1.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.2. When undertaking an assurance assessment of an eKYC System for the purpose of Rule \\u200e9.3.1A, a Relevant Person should seek to establish that the eKYC System is reliable and independent, and allows the Relevant Person to comply with all applicable Rules of the Regulator. In addition, a Relevant Person should consider applying guidance on assurance standards issued by the Regulator, competent U.A.E. authorities, FATF, and other relevant standard setting bodies.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.3. In limited circumstances, a Relevant Person may place reliance on the assurance assessment of the eKYC System conducted entirely by another entity. Such circumstances comprise the following.\\n(a)\\tWhere an assurance assessment of the eKYC System has been undertaken by a Related entity and specifically addresses the Rules and Regulations applicable to the Relevant Person. In such circumstances, the Relevant Person remains responsible for the eKYC System\\u2019s compliance with applicable Rules and Laws and it should maintain a copy of the assessment.\\n(b)\\tWhere the eKYC System has been authorised by a competent authority of the U.A.E. or a competent authority in a jurisdiction with AML/TFS laws equivalent to the U.A.E. In such circumstances, the eKYC system should be authorised for use in CDD. Further, the Relevant Person should undertake its own review to ensure that any use of the relevant eKYC System is appropriate and enables compliance with all Rules and Regulations applicable to the Relevant Person.\\n(c)\\tWhere a Relevant Person chooses to employ a third party to assist in its own assurance assessment of the eKYC System, it should ensure that a competent and independent firm with relevant expertise and resources be employed. The Relevant Person remains wholly responsible for the eKYC System\\u2019s compliance with, and any failure to meet, the Rules and Regulations applicable to the Relevant Person.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.4. In complying with Rule \\u200e9.3.1, a Relevant Person should ensure that the service provider can be replaced with minimal disruption in the event the outsourcing arrangement is terminated.\\n9.3.1B.Guidance.5. An Authorised Person is also required to comply with the outsourcing obligations in GEN 3.3.31 and 3.3.32 and PRU 6.8. A Recognised Body is also required to comply with the outsourcing obligations in MIR 2.14.\\n9.3.2 Authorised Persons Providing Money Services\\n9.3.2.(1) An Authorised Person that is engaged in Providing Money Services must:\\n(b)\\tmaintain a complete, current and accurate register of all agents and members of its Group it uses to conduct its operations and make that register available to the Regulator upon request;\\n(c)\\tinclude all agents and members of its Group identified in (a) as part of its AML/TFS compliance programme and monitor the compliance of such agents and members of its Group with the requirements of its AML/TFS programme;\\n(d)\\tcomply with all AML/TFS requirements imposed in all jurisdictions within which it operates and ensure the compliance of its agents and members of its Group operating on its behalf with all AML/TFS requirements in the jurisdictions in which they are operating;\\n(e)\\twhen executing a Payment Transaction, assess and consider all relevant information, including information about the Payer and the Payee, including any beneficiary as may be applicable, and require its agents and members of its Group, as appropriate, to determine whether a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report should be filed by it or its agents or a member of its Group; and\\n(f)\\twhere appropriate, ensure that the relevant equivalent of a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report is filed in all other jurisdictions related to a suspicious Payment Transaction and make available to all authorities responsible for AML/TFS compliance all transaction information related to the suspicious transaction.\\n9.3.2.(2) An Authorised Person making an assessment under (1) must rely upon current sources of information when making such assessment and must keep adequate records concerning such assessments, including all sources and materials considered, for a period of at least six years.\\n9.3.2.Guidance \\nAgents directly facilitate the activities of Authorised Persons in servicing their clients, as distinct from other service providers that provide purely ancillary services, such as IT, facilities management etc. to an Authorised Person.\\n\\n\"\n"
