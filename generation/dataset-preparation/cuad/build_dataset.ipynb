The failure to give such notice will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense and settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in such defense, at the Indemnifying Party\\'s expense. The Indemnified Party will be entitled at its own expense to participate in such defense and to employ separate counsel for such purpose. For so long as the Indemnifying Party is diligently defending any proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.3, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, for any settlement effected without its consent. No Party shall enter into any compromise or settlement which commits the other Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action without the other Party\\'s prior written consent (and unless such compromise or settlement includes no payments by the Indemnified Party, an unconditional release of, and no admission of liability by, the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim).\\n\\n11.4 Limitation of Liability.

THE FOREGOING SENTENCE SHALL NOT LIMIT (1) THE OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER PARTY TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FROM AND AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.1 OR 11.2, AS APPLICABLE, OR (2) DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY\\'S BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE OBLIGATIONS IN ARTICLE 9.\\n\\n11.5 Insurance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, it shall maintain, through purchase or self- insurance, adequate insurance, including products liability coverage and comprehensive general liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations under this Agreement and which are consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated. Each Party shall provide reasonable written proof of the existence of such insurance to the other Party upon request. Dova does not and will not maintain or procure any worker\\'s compensation, healthcare, or other insurance for or on behalf of any Field Force Personnel, all of which shall be Valeant\\'s sole responsibility.

(\"Dova\") (DOVA), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug candidates for diseases where there is a high unmet need, and Salix Pharmaceuticals (\"Salix\"), one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical companies in the world committed to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and its parent company, Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC), today announced that they have entered into an exclusive agreement to co-promote Dova\\'s DOPTELET (avatrombopag) in the United States (U.S.). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved DOPTELET on May 21, 2018 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET represents the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved in the United States for this indication.\\n\\nThrombocytopenia, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality in patients with CLD that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the 7.5 million patients with CLD have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in 2010, patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<75,000/µL) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased rate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.\\n\\nAs part of the co-promotion arrangement, Salix intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promote DOPTELET to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The Salix sales force will begin selling DOPTELET in mid-October 2018. Dova will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain other specialties. Pursuant to the agreement, Dova will pay Salix a quarterly fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of DOPTELET prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S.\\n\\n\"We are delighted to be working with Salix, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force in the United States,\" said Alex C. Sapir, president and chief executive officer, Dova Pharmaceuticals. \"Given Salix\\'s presence and strong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among the gastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to DOPTELET and to patients.\"\\n\\n\"Salix considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with XIFAXAN® (rifaximin), an innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence of chronic liver disease,\" said Mark McKenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. \"Adding DOPTELET to our portfolio will enable our sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace.\"\\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

DOPTELET is designed to mimic the effects of TPO, the primary regulator of normal platelet production.\\n\\nTwo global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ADAPT-1 [N=231] and ADAPT-2 [N=204]), conducted in adults with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/µL) and CLD, supported the FDA approval. Patients were assigned to either 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag daily for five days based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to <50,000/µmL or <40,000/µmL, respectively). Avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients not requiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding up to seven days following a scheduled procedure in both trials in both the 40 mg (ADAPT-1, 88% vs. 38%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 88% vs. 33%; p<0.0001), and 60 mg (ADAPT-1, 66% vs. 23%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 69% vs. 35%; p=0.0006) treatment groups. Avatrombopag was also superior to placebo at the two secondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patients achieving the target platelet count of ≥50,000/µmL on procedure day, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet count from baseline to procedure day; all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for each secondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values <0.0001. The most common adverse reactions with avatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses have been reported in patients with CLD and in patients receiving TPO receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal vein thrombosis was reported in the ADAPT trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient.\\n\\nINDICATION\\n\\nDOPTELET (avatrombopag) is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure.\\n\\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\\n\\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\\n\\nDOPTELET is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease treated with TPO receptor agonists. In the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 clinical trials, there was one treatment- emergent event of portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n=1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia treated with DOPTELET.\\n\\nConsider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering DOPTELET to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, Antithrombin deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency).\\n\\nDOPTELET should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts.\\n\\nCONTRAINDICATIONS: None\\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

It has been proven to reduce the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalizations in adults.\\n\\n*There is an increased systemic exposure in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when administering XIFAXAN to these patients.\\n\\nINDICATION  XIFAXAN (rifaximin) 550 mg tablets are indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence in adults and for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.\\n\\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\\n\\n•XIFAXAN is not for everyone. Do not take XIFAXAN if you have a known hypersensitivity to rifaximin, any of the rifamycin antimicrobial agents, or any of the components in XIFAXAN.\\n\\n•If you take antibiotics, like XIFAXAN, there is a chance you could experience diarrhea caused by an overgrowth of bacteria (C. difficile). This can cause symptoms ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. Contact your healthcare provider if your diarrhea does not improve or worsens.\\n\\n•Talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN if you have severe hepatic (liver) impairment, as this may cause increased effects of the medicine.\\n\\n•Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking drugs called P-glycoprotein and/or OATPs inhibitors (such as cyclosporine) because using these drugs with XIFAXAN may lead to an increase in the amount of XIFAXAN absorbed by your body.\\n\\n•In clinical studies, the most common side effects of XIFAXAN were: HE: Peripheral edema (swelling, usually in the ankles or lower limbs), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), dizziness, fatigue (feeling tired), and ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdomen)  IBS-D: Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and an increase in liver enzymes\\n\\n•XIFAXAN may affect warfarin activity when taken together. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking warfarin because the dose of warfarin may need to be adjusted to maintain proper blood-thinning effect.\\n\\n•If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing, talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN because XIFAXAN may cause harm to an unborn baby or nursing infant. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.
