They should be provided with an individual sleeping place and given bedding, tableware and toiletries. All inmates should have at their disposal in their cell no less than four square metres of personal space (section 23).\n\n001-108465\n221: In all cases where a violation of Article 3 has already occurred, the Court considers that the State must be prepared to acknowledge the violation and make readily available some form of compensation to the aggrieved individual. The introduction of the preventive remedy alone would clearly not be sufficient because a remedy designed to prevent the overcrowding and other violations of Article 3 from occurring would not be adequate to redress a situation in which the individual has already endured for some time inhuman or degrading treatment. The respondent Government must therefore put in place a remedy which can provide redress for the violations that have already occurred. The Court would add that the introduction of an effective compensatory remedy would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdictions (see Demopoulos and Others (dec.), cited above, § 69, and also, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 188, ECHR 2006V).\n\n001-108465\n157: As regards access to toilets, the Court has noted in many cases that in Russian remand prisons the lavatory pan was placed in the corner of the cell and either lacked any separation from the living area or was separated by a single partition approximately one to one a half metres high. Such close proximity and exposure was not only objectionable from a hygiene perspective but also deprived a detainee using the toilet of any privacy because he remained at all times in full view of other inmates sitting on the bunks and also of warders looking through the peephole (see, among other authorities, Aleksandr Makarov, § 97, Trepashkin, § 94, Grishin, § 94, and Kalashnikov, § 99, all cited above). In one case the Court considered that the lack of privacy resulting from the openness of the toilet area must have taken a particularly heavy toll on the applicant, who was undergoing treatment for haemorrhoids and had to apply his medication in front of his cellmates and warders (see Moiseyev, cited above, § 124).</s><s>[INST] You are an ECHR legal expert tasked to answer a question.\n\nAnswer the following question using the retrieved documents.

                "CASE OF ANANYEV AND OTHERS v. RUSSIA; § 1: The case originated in two applications against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Russian nationals, Mr Sergey Mikhaylovich Ananyev (no. 42525/07) and Mr Gennadiy Gennadyevich Bashirov and Ms Gulnara Sayfullayevna Bashirova (no. 60800/08) (“the applicants”), on 14 September 2007 and 10 November 2008, respectively.\n2: The applicant Mr Ananyev was represented by Ms O. Preobrazhenskaya, a legal specialist resident in . The applicants Mr Bashirov and Ms Bashirova were represented by Mr A. Anokhin, a lawyer practising in .\n3: The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.\n4: The applicants alleged, in particular, that they had been detained in inhuman and degrading conditions and that they had not had effective domestic remedies at their disposal.\n5: On 14 May 2009 the Court decided to communicate the applicants’ complaints to the Government, raising specific additional questions about the structural nature of the underlying problems. The Court also decided to grant the cases priority under Rule 41 and to inform the parties that it was considering the suitability of applying a pilot-judgment procedure (see Broniowski v. Poland [GC], 31443/96, §§ 189-194 and the operative part, ECHR 2004-V, and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland [GC] no. 35014/97, ECHR 2006-..., §§ 231-239 and the operative part).\n6: The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n7: All three applicants were remanded in custody pending trial and were held in various Russian remand prisons. Their individual circumstances are detailed below.\n8: On 27 December 2006 the Presidium of the  quashed the appellate judgment in Mr Ananyev’s criminal case and remitted the matter for a new hearing. On 20 January 2007 he was taken from the correctional colony to remand prison IZ-67/1 of , where he stayed until 23 March 2007.\n9: Mr Ananyev was held in cell 170 until 21 March 2007 and then in cell 153. Cell 170 measured 15 square metres and cell 153 – 10 square metres. They were equipped with 13 and 4 sleeping places, respectively.\n10: Cell 170 accommodated 12 detainees for two weeks in January and February 2007; in the remaining period of Mr Ananyev’s detention the cell population varied from 15 to 21 persons. Cell 153 housed Mr Ananyev and one other inmate.\n11: The Government submitted certificates issued on 25 June 2009 by the governor of the remand prison that listed floor surface areas and cell population, and twelve pages from the prison population register of prison IZ-67/1 relating to various dates between 20 January and 23 March 2007, as well as photographs of cells 153 and 170.\n12: Mr Ananyev produced written statements from his former co-detainees, Mr S. and Mr B., both dated 27 June 2009, from which it appears that between January and April 2007 cell 170 had accommodated up to 24 persons.\n13: On 19 March 2007 Mr Ananyev sent complaints about unbearable conditions of his detention to the Prosecutor General, the Smolensk town prosecutor and to the Director of the  penitentiary facilities. On 4 May 2007 the  town prosecutor informed Mr Ananyev that he had checked his complaints and that the acting governor of prison IZ-67/1 had been instructed to remedy the violations of the Suspects and Defendants Detention Act.\n14: Mr and Ms Bashirov were taken into custody on 29 April 2005. Ms Bashirova was released on bail on 17 May 2005 and Mr Bashirov was transferred to remand prison IZ-30/1 of . On 11 March 2008 they were both found guilty of drug-related offences and sentenced to eight and a half years’ and six years’ imprisonment, respectively. Ms Bashirova was re-detained on the same day. On 15 May 2008 the  upheld the conviction at last instance.\n15: In prison IZ-30/1, Mr Bashirov stayed in cell 83 (from 3 May to 1 July 2005 and from 27 December 2007 to 22 April 2008), cell 69 (from 1 July 2005 to 11 January 2006 and from 9 August to 30 October 2006), cell 35 (from 11 January to 9 August 2006), cell 79 (from 30 October to 18 December 2007), and cell 15 (from 22 April to 21 May 2008). From 18 to 27 December 2007 Mr Bashirov underwent treatment in a prison hospital.\n16: In the same prison Ms Bashirova stayed in cell 52 (from 3 to 17 May 2005), cell 40 (from 11 to 15 March 2008) and cell 45 (from 15 March to 7 June 2008).\n17: Mr Bashirov’s cells presented the following characteristics:\n18: Ms Bashirova’s cells had the following measurements:\n19: The parties disagreed on the number of detainees. The Government submitted that the number of detainees “had not exceeded the number of sleeping places”. They relied on a certificate issued by the prison governor on 29 June 2009. The applicants gave the following cell population figures: cell 15 – 15 persons, cell 69 – 22 persons, cells 35, 50 and 83 – 14 persons, cell 79 – 20 persons, cell 52 – 30 persons on average but up to 40 persons on certain days, cell 45 – 9 persons.\n20: The applicants submitted extracts from annual reports by the Ombudsman of the Astrakhan Region. The 2005 Report criticised the conditions of detention in the  prisons:\n21: The 2006 Report showed that the situation had hardly improved:\n22: The 2007 Report acknowledged that the problem of overcrowding had remained “grave” and that prison IZ-30/1 actually accommodated 879 inmates.\n23: The 2008 Report criticised the officially accepted limits:\n24: The applicant Mr Bashirov also produced a copy of a letter which the Astrakhan Regional prosecutor’s office had sent to his counsel on 28 February 2008 in response to a complaint about the conditions of detention raised by another detainee. The letter stated as follows:\n25: Personal dignity is protected by the State and may not be undermined for any reason (Article 21 § 1).\n26: Detention on remand must be based on the principles of lawfulness, fairness, presumption of innocence, equality before the law, humanism, respect for human dignity and must be carried out in accordance with the Russian Constitution, international legal principles and norms and international treaties, to which Russia is a party, and must not involve torture or other actions that purport to cause physical or moral suffering to the suspect or defendant (section 4).\n27: Detention on remand may be effected in (a) remand prisons of the penitentiary system (следственные изоляторы), (b) temporary detention wards of the police (изоляторы временного содержания), and (c) temporary detention wards of the border service (section 7).\n28: Detainees have, in particular, the right:\n29: Detainees should be kept in conditions which satisfy health and hygiene requirements. They should be provided with an individual sleeping place and given bedding, tableware and toiletries. All inmates should have at their disposal in their cell no less than four square metres of personal space (section 23).\n30: The Prosecutor General and subordinate prosecutors must supervise the application of legal norms in remand prisons. Prison authorities must comply with the instructions of the supervising prosecutor in so far as they concern the detention rules as established in this Act (section 51).\n31: The Ombudsman may receive complaints concerning the actions by federal and municipal State bodies or employees, provided that the complainant has previously lodged a judicial or administrative appeal in this connection (section 16 § 1).\n32: Having examined the complaint, the Ombudsman may apply to a court or prosecutor for the protection of the rights and freedoms which have been breached by an unlawful action or inaction of a State official or petition the competent authorities for institution of disciplinary, administrative or criminal proceedings against the State official who has committed such a breach (section 29 § 1).\n33: The Ombudsman prepares a summary of individual complaints and he or she may submit to State and municipal authorities recommendations of a general nature on the ways to improve the protection of individual rights and freedoms or suggest legislative amendments to the lawmakers (section 31).\n37: Chapter 25 sets out the procedure for a judicial examination of complaints about decisions, acts or omissions of the State and municipal authorities and officials. Pursuant to Ruling no. 2 of 10 February 2009 by the Plenary Supreme Court of the , complaints by suspects, defendants and convicts about inappropriate conditions of detention must be examined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 25 (point 7).\n38: A citizen may lodge a complaint about an act or decision by any State authority which he believes has breached his rights or freedoms, either with a court of general jurisdiction or by sending it to the directly higher official or authority (Article 254). The complaint may concern any decision, act or omission which has violated rights or freedoms, has impeded the exercise of rights or freedoms, or has imposed a duty or liability on the citizen (Article 255).\n39: The complaint must be lodged within three months of the date when the citizen learnt of the breach of his rights. The time-period may be extended for valid reasons (Article 256). The complaint must be examined within ten days; if necessary, in the absence of the respondent authority or official (Article 257).\n40: The burden of proof as to the lawfulness of the contested decision, act or omission lies with the authority or official concerned. If necessary, the court may obtain evidence of its own initiative (point 20 of Ruling no. 2).\n41: If the court finds the complaint justified, it issues a decision requiring the authority or official to fully remedy the breach of the citizen’s rights (Article 258 § 1). The court determines the time-limit for remedying the violation with regard to the nature of the complaint and the efforts that need to be deployed to remedy the violation in full (point 28 of Ruling no. 2).\n42: The decision is dispatched to the head of the authority concerned, to the official concerned or to their superiors, within three days of its entry into force. The court and the complainant must be notified of the enforcement of the decision no later than one month after its receipt (Article 258 §§ 2 and 3).\n43: Civil rights may be protected in many forms, including in particular, recognition of the right, re-establishment of the status quo ante and the discontinuance of violations of the right or the prevention of such violations, and compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage (Article 12).\n44: An individual’s life and health, personal dignity and integrity, honour and goodwill are considered to be the person’s “non-property rights” or “intangible assets”, which are protected under the Civil Code and other laws in the cases and to the extent that the forms of the protection of civil rights listed in Article 12 correspond to the essence of the violated intangible right and to the consequences of such violation (Article 150).\n45: If certain actions impairing an individual’s personal non-property rights or encroaching on other intangible assets have caused him or her non-pecuniary damage (physical or mental suffering), the court may impose on the perpetrator an obligation to pay pecuniary compensation for that damage. The amount of compensation is determined by reference to the gravity of the perpetrator’s fault and other significant circumstances. The court also takes into account the extent of physical or mental suffering in relation to the victim’s individual characteristics (Article 151).\n46: Damage caused to the person or property of a citizen shall be compensated in full by the tortfeasor. The tortfeasor is not liable for damage if he proves that the damage has been caused through no fault of his own (Article 1064 §§ 1, 2).\n47: State and municipal bodies and officials shall be liable for damage caused to a citizen by their unlawful actions or omissions (Article 1069). Irrespective of any fault by State officials, the State or regional treasury are liable for damage sustained by a citizen on account of (i) unlawful criminal conviction or prosecution; (ii) unlawful application of a preventive measure, and (iii) unlawful administrative punishment (Article 1070).\n48: Compensation for non-pecuniary damage is effected in accordance with Article 151 of the Civil Code and is unrelated to any award in respect of pecuniary damage (Article 1099). Irrespective of the tortfeasor’s fault, non-pecuniary damage shall be compensated for if the damage was caused (i) by a hazardous device; (ii) in the event of unlawful conviction or prosecution or unlawful application of a preventive measure or unlawful administrative punishment, and (iii) through dissemination of information which was damaging to honour, dignity or reputation (Article 1100).\n49: “Preventive measures” (меры пресечения) include an undertaking not to leave a town or region, personal surety, bail, house arrest and detention on remand (Article 98).\n50: Placement in custody may be ordered by a court if the charge carries a sentence of at least two years’ imprisonment, provided that a less restrictive preventive measure cannot be applied (Article 108). A court may order detention on remand if there are sufficient reasons to believe that the suspect might abscond, re-offend or threaten a witness, destroy evidence or otherwise obstruct the preliminary investigation or trial of the criminal case (Article 97). The circumstances to be taken into account when imposing a preventive measure include, apart from those specified in Article 97, the seriousness of the charges and the suspect’s personality, age, health, family status, occupation and other circumstances (Article 98).\n51: After arrest, the suspect is placed in custody “pending investigation”. The maximum permitted period of detention “pending investigation” is two months but it can be extended for up to eighteen months in “exceptional circumstances” (Article 109 §§ 1-3).\n52: On 29 October 2009 the Plenary Supreme Court of the  adopted Ruling no. 22 governing the application of preventive measures, including placement of custody, bail and house arrest. It provided in particular that detention on remand may be ordered only if it is impossible to impose a more lenient preventive measure (point 2). When examining an application for a detention order, the courts were required to assess the existence of a reasonable suspicion that the person concerned had been involved in the commission of the offence (point 19). When issuing further extension orders, courts were to specify concrete facts justifying the continued detention and the supporting evidence (point 21). In addition, the courts had to explain why it was not possible to apply a more lenient measure (point 26).\n53: The information submitted by the Government and the statistical data available on the website of the Judicial Department of the Supreme Court (www.cdep.ru) show the number of cases in which first-instance courts granted prosecutors’ applications for an initial detention order or for its extension, and the total number of individuals convicted or acquitted at first instance (excluding the cases that were discontinued and did not end in either a conviction or an acquittal) during the reference year:\n54: By Resolution no. 540 of 5 September 2006, the Russian Government approved a federal expenditure programme under the title “Development of the Criminal Justice and Penitentiary System in 2007-2016”. As amended by subsequent Government Resolutions, the programme description reads as follows:\n55: The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted by the First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, held at Geneva in 1955, and approved by the Economic and Social Council by its resolution 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977, provide, in particular, as follows:\n56: The relevant extracts from the General Reports prepared by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) read as follows:\n57: On 30 September 1999 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted Recommendation No. R (99) 22 concerning prison overcrowding and prison population inflation, which provides in particular as follows:\n58: On 11 January 2006 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted Recommendation Rec(2006)2 to member States on the European Prison Rules, which replaced Recommendation No. R (87) 3 on the European Prison Rules accounting for the developments which had occurred in penal policy, sentencing practice and the overall management of prisons in Europe. The amended European Prison Rules lay down the following guidelines:\n59: On 4 June 2003 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2003)123 concerning the Court’s judgment in the Kalashnikov v. Russia case of 15 July 2002, final on 15 October 2002. It read in particular as follows:\n60: On 4 March 2010 the Committee of Ministers adopted Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 on the execution of the thirty-one judgments against  mainly concerning conditions of detention in remand prisons. It provided in particular as follows:\n61: On 22 October 2009 the Court adopted pilot judgments in the cases of Orchowski v. Poland (no. 17885/04) and Norbert Sikorski v. Poland (no. 17599/05), in which it found under Article 46 of the Convention that, for many years, namely from 2000 until at least mid-2008, the overcrowding in Polish remand centres had revealed a structural problem consisting of a “practice that [was] incompatible with the Convention” (see § 151 and §§ 155-156, respectively).\n62: On 9 October 2009 the Polish Parliament enacted a law amending the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences which entered into force on 6 December 2009. It introduced a number of new rules governing temporary placement of detainees in cells below the statutory norm of three square metres per inmate.\n63: A new provision lists the emergency situations in which the prison governor may place a detainee for a specified period not longer than ninety days in a cell in which the area per inmate will be less than three square metres but not less than two square metres. The situations include the introduction of martial law, natural disasters, epidemics, and a threat to prison security (Article 110 § 2b). It also defines the categories of prisoners who may be held in such conditions for a period not exceeding fourteen days: recidivists, sexual offenders, escapees, temporary transfers from other prisons, etc. (§ 2c). An appeal against the governor’s decision lies with a penitentiary judge (§ 2d). Detainees who have been placed in a cell with restricted personal space shall be assured an additional half-hour of daily walks and a wider range of out-of-cell cultural, educational and sports activities (§ 2h).\n64: On 17 March 2010 the Polish Supreme Court allowed a cassation appeal by a prisoner against the dismissal of his claim for compensation in respect of an infringement of his personal rights on account of severe prison overcrowding (sixteen inmates in a cell designed for eleven persons). The Supreme Court reiterated that the right to be detained in conditions respecting one’s dignity belonged to the catalogue of personal rights and that the State treasury should be liable for an infringement of such rights. It determined that the prison authorities had failed to show the existence of a “particularly justified case” for placement of detainees in an already overcrowded facility and in that way had acted unlawfully.\n65: On 12 October 2010 the Court issued admissibility decisions in the cases of Łatak v. Poland (no. 52070/08) and Łomiński v.  (no. 33502/09) in the framework of the pilot-judgment procedure. It re-examined the applicants’ situation in the light of the above-mentioned developments at domestic level and found that the Supreme Court’s judgment of 17 March 2010 constituted a material element which was indispensable for the consolidation of the previous practice of civil courts in cases concerning claims for compensation on account of prison overcrowding (Łatak, § 80). Accordingly, the applicants were required to seek redress at domestic level and bring a civil action for compensation before Polish courts (ibid., § 81) and their applications to the Court were inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies (§ 82). The Court also noted that the amended Article 110 § 2 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences provided detainees with a new legal means for contesting the governor’s decision to reduce the available cell space. It could not therefore be excluded that applicants would be required to make use of the new complaints system before applying to the Court (§ 87).\n66: The Court notes at the outset that all the applicants complained about the allegedly inhuman conditions of their detention in Russian detention facilities and also about the absence of an effective domestic remedy in that connection. Having regard to the similarity of the applicants’ grievances, the Court is of the view that, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the applications should be joined in accordance with Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court.\n67: The Court will begin its examination with a verification of whether or not the admissibility criteria in Article 35 of the Convention have been met in each individual case. Paragraph 1 of Article 35 provides as follows:\n68: The Government submitted that the applicants had not exhausted the domestic remedies because they had not applied to Russian courts with claims for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage in connection with the allegedly inhuman conditions of their detention. The procedure for making claims was established in Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as clarified by the Supreme Court’s Ruling no. 2 of 10 February 2009. Articles 151 and 1069 allowed individuals to claim compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by unlawful actions of State authorities. According to the information from the Russian courts, in the period from 2006 to the first six months of 2009 detainees had submitted 1,419 complaints about inappropriate detention conditions and claims for non-pecuniary damage. Of those, 505 had been declared inadmissible on procedural grounds. As a result of an examination of the merits, the claims had been granted in 315 cases and rejected in 599 cases.\n69: The Government further pointed out that the prosecutors had competence to review compliance with laws in penitentiary institutions. They carried out monthly inspections of remand prisons, during which they checked in particular the conditions of detention and medical assistance. In the Government’s view, such inspections were an effective remedy capable of preventing breaches of law and putting an end to them. This remedy was accessible to everyone who was held in custody. The applicant Mr Ananyev complained to a prosecutor about unsatisfactory conditions of detention in cell 160 and was transferred to another cell, following the prosecutor’s intervention.\n70: The Court considers that the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies is closely linked to the merits of the applicants’ complaint that they did not have at their disposal an effective remedy for complaining about inhuman conditions of detention. Thus, the Court finds it necessary to join the Government’s objection to the merits of the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention (compare Benediktov v. , no. 106/02, § 25, 10 May 2007).\n71: The Court reiterates that, in contrast to an objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, which must be raised by the respondent Government, it cannot set aside the application of the six-month rule solely because a government have not made a preliminary objection to that effect (see Maltabar and Maltabar v. Russia, no. 6954/02, § 80, 29 January 2009; Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000-I; and also Blečić v. Croatia [GC], no. 59532/00, § 68, ECHR 2006-...).\n72: As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of the knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Dennis and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76573/01, 2 July 2002). In cases featuring a continuing situation, the six-month period runs from the cessation of that situation (see Seleznev v. Russia, no. 15591/03, § 34, 26 June 2008, and Koval v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 65550/01, 30 March 2004).\n73: The Court observes that Mr Ananyev and Mr Bashirov spent the entire period of their detention in their respective remand prisons and that there were no appreciable variations in the conditions of their detention or interruptions during that period. As they introduced their complaints within six months of the end of their respective detention periods, they have complied with the six-month criterion. On the other hand, the case of Ms Bashirova requires particular attention on the part of the Court in terms of her compliance with the six-month rule.\n74: In her initial application form dated 10 November 2008, Ms Bashirova complained about a short period of her detention that had ended on 17 May 2005. In her observations on the admissibility and merits of the application submitted on 2 November 2009, she complained about a further period of detention that had lasted from March to June 2008. The Court has to determine whether or not it would be appropriate to make a cumulative assessment of the two periods of her detention in the same facility.\n75: The concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs in which there are continuous activities by or on the part of the State which render the applicant a victim (see Posti and Rahko v. , no. 27824/95, § 39, ECHR 2002VII). Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation (see Nevmerzgitskiy v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 58825/00, 25 November 2003, where the applicant was subjected to force-feeding, and Tarariyeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 4353/03, 11 October 2005, where the applicant’s son was denied medical assistance). However, in the event of a repetition of the same events, such as an applicant’s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court’s view, a “continuing situation” which brought the entire period complained of within the Court’s competence (see Vlasov v. Russia (dec.), no. 78146/01, 14 February 2006, and Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004). Similarly, in a situation where the applicant’s detention in the police ward was not continuous but occurred at regular intervals when he was brought there for an interview with the investigator or other procedural acts, the Court accepted that in the absence of any material change in the conditions of his detention, the breaking-up of his detention into several periods was not justified (see Nedayborshch v. , no. 42255/04, § 25, 1 July 2010). In another case, the applicant’s absence from the detention facility for carrying out a certain procedural act did not prevent the Court from recognising the continuous nature of his detention in that facility (see Romanov v. Russia, no. 63993/00, § 73, 20 October 2005, where the applicant spent one month out of the remand prison in a psychiatric institution). Nevertheless, where an applicant was released but subsequently re-detained, the Court limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, § 48, 4 December 2008; Grishin v. Russia, no. 30983/02, § 83, 15 November 2007; and Dvoynykh v. Ukraine, no. 72277/01, § 46, 12 October 2006).\n76: An applicant’s detention in the domestic system is rarely effected within the confines of the same facility: usually he or she would spend a few first days in the police custody, move later to a remand prison during the investigation and trial and, if convicted, begin to serve the sentence in a correctional colony. Different types of detention facilities have different purposes and vary accordingly in the material conditions they can offer. Thus, temporary detention wings located inside police stations are designed for short-term custody only and often lack the amenities indispensable for prolonged detention, such as a toilet, sink, or exercise yard (see for example Shchebet v. , no. 16074/07, § 89, 12 June 2008), whereas in correctional colonies – in contrast to remand prisons – the restricted space in the dormitories is compensated for by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). The difference in material conditions of detention creates the presumption that an applicant’s transfer to a different type of facility would require the submission of a separate complaint about the conditions of detention in the previous facility within six months of such transfer (see Volchkov v. Russia, no. 45196/04, § 27, 14 October 2010; Gultyayeva v. Russia, no. 67413/01, § 148, 1 April 2010; Maltabar, cited above, §§ 82-84, and Nurmagomedov (dec.), cited above). Only in a few exceptional cases, having regard to the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of the detention conditions in both facilities, has the Court recognised the existence of a “continuous situation” encompassing the applicant’s stay both in police custody and in the remand prison (see Lutokhin v. Russia, no. 12008/03, §§ 40-42, 8 April 2010; Seleznev, cited above, § 36, and Guliyev v. Russia, no. 24650/02, § 33, 19 June 2008).\n77: As long as the applicant stays within the same type of detention facility, and provided the material conditions have remained substantially the same, it matters not that he or she was transferred between cells or wings within the same remand prison (see Trepashkin v. Russia (no. 2), no. 14248/05, §§ 108-109, 16 December 2010, and Nazarov v. Russia, no. 13591/05, § 78, 26 November 2009), from one remand prison to another within the same region (see Romokhov v. Russia, no. 4532/04, § 74, 16 December 2010; Mukhutdinov v. Russia, no. 13173/02, § 77, 10 June 2010; Goroshchenya v. Russia, no. 38711/03, § 62, 22 April 2010; and Benediktov, cited above, § 31) or even to a remand prison in a different region (see Aleksandr Matveyev v. Russia, no. 14797/02, § 67, 8 July 2010, and Buzhinayev v. Russia, no. 17679/03, § 23, 15 October 2009). Nevertheless, a significant change in the detention regime, even where it occurs within the same facility, has been held by the Court to put an end to the “continuous situation” as described above and the six-month time-limit would thus be calculated from that moment: this would be the case for instance where the applicant has moved from a communal cell to solitary confinement (see Zakharkin v. Russia, no. 1555/04, § 115, 10 June 2010) or from an ordinary cell to the hospital wing.\n78: The Court’s approach to the application of the six-month rule to complaints concerning the conditions of an applicant’s detention may therefore be summarised in the following manner: a period of an applicant’s detention should be regarded as a “continuing situation” as long as the detention has been effected in the same type of detention facility in substantially similar conditions. Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant’s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the “continuing situation”. The complaint about the conditions of detention must be filed within six months from the end of the situation complained about or, if there was an effective domestic remedy to be exhausted, of the final decision in the process of exhaustion.\n79: Examining the case of Ms Bashirova in the light of the above principles, the Court notes that she was held in the remand prison on two occasions. As she was released in-between, her detention is not regarded as a “continuing situation” but rather as two distinct periods. The complaint about an initial period of her detention followed by her release was submitted more than three years after it had ended and the complaint about her subsequent stay in the remand prison until her transfer to a correctional colony was introduced more than one year after the transfer. In both instances the complaint was raised more than six months after the respective detention period had ended. It follows that they have been introduced out of time and must also be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n80: The Court has found that the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies must be joined to the merits of the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention and that the complaints by Ms Bashirova’ relating to the conditions of her detention were submitted out of time and were inadmissible. As to the remainder of their complaints concerning the conditions of their detention and the existence of effective domestic remedies, the Court considers that they raise serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. The Court concludes therefore that they are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. No other ground for declaring them inadmissible has been established.\n81: The applicants also raised additional complaints about various alleged deficiencies in the criminal proceedings against them, their pre-trial detention, property issues, spousal visits and other matters. The Court has given careful consideration to these grievances in the light of all the material in its possession and considers that, in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.\n82: In the light of the foregoing, the Court declares admissible the complaints by the applicants Mr Ananyev and Mr Bashirov about the conditions of their detention in remand prisons IZ-67/1 and IZ-30/1 and about the alleged absence of an effective domestic remedy and joins to the merits the Government’s objection relating to the alleged non-exhaustion of the domestic remedies.\n83: The Court further declares inadmissible the remainder of the complaints by the applicants Mr Ananyev and Mr Bashirov and all of Ms Bashirova’s complaints.\n84: The Court requested the parties to comment on whether the present applications disclosed the persistence of a structural problem relating to conditions of detention which had been highlighted in various aspects in the Court’s previous judgments (see Annex) and the Committee of Ministers’ decisions and on whether the applicants had effective domestic remedies at their disposal for their complaints about the allegedly inhuman conditions of their detention. The parties’ submissions may be summarised in the following manner.\n85: The Government submitted that the applicants’ complaints under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention were unsubstantiated. They pointed out that the Russian authorities were making considerable efforts to reduce recourse to preventive measures of a custodial nature. The President of the  had declared the “humanisation of justice” and expedited processing of cases to be the priorities for development of the judicial system. The Government explained that the Supreme Court had prepared the text of a ruling governing the application of preventive measures, including those of a custodial nature, in which it clarified that placement in custody should be applied only if a less restrictive preventive measure was not an available option (see paragraph 52 above). The Prosecutor General’s Office had directed the prosecutors to specify, in each application for a detention order, the concrete circumstances which made it impossible to use less restrictive preventive measures. The statistics, cited in paragraph 53 above, demonstrated that the prosecutors and courts had adopted a more nuanced approach to using custodial measures.\n86: In order to implement Recommendation No. R (99) 22 (see paragraph 57 above), from 1999 to date the Russian authorities had carried out major reforms of the penitentiary system with a view to reducing the overall prison population. The measures included amending acts and regulations relating to the functioning of the penitentiary system, expansion of the network of remand prisons and construction of new cells, reducing the number of individuals transiting through remand prisons, and co-ordinated action of the police, prosecution and courts with a view to expediting the processing of cases. As a result of those measures, the prison population in SIZOs had decreased from 282,000 individuals in 1999 to 133,000 in January 2009.\n87: In 2002-2006, a federal expenditure programme for the reform of the penitentiary system had been implemented. It had allowed the prison authorities to make an additional 13,100 places available. In 2006, the Russian Government had approved a new expenditure programme for the period from 2007 to 2016 (see paragraph 54 above). In the first two years of the programme’s implementation more than 3,600 places had been created in remand prisons. By the end of 2008, the percentage of remand prisons that met Russian detention standards had risen to 34%. However, in 2009 the financing of the programme had been cut by 30% and a further cut by 45% was expected in 2010. From 1999 to 2009 the number of remand prisons had increased from 187 to 225, their design capacity from 112,500 to 151,000 places and the average cell space per inmate from 1.6 to 4.5 square metres. As at 1 July 2009 the remand prisons accommodated 133,200 detainees, representing 88.2% of their capacity. In sixty-seven regions, detainees had at their disposal four or more square metres of cell space per person.\n88: In the past four years the total investment in capital and current repairs for remand prisons had amounted to 1,5 billion roubles (RUB), equivalent to approximately 38 million euros. Cells had been equipped with PVC windows, mandatory ventilation and new piping. Walls had been painted in light colours. Metal blinds had been removed from all windows, unblocking access to natural air and light.\n89: The Government also submitted that the legislative framework governing pre-trial detention issues had evolved in the light of the recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture. For example, untried prisoners had been granted the right to make telephone calls to their relatives; the practice of accommodating foreign prisoners on separate premises had been discontinued; letters addressed to the federal and regional Ombudsmen and to the Court were exempt from censorship; the minimum exercise time for detainees in the punishment cell had been increased from 30 minutes to one hour. Improvements in the provision of medical care and assistance had been achieved.\n90: The applicants maintained their complaints under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention. They submitted that unsatisfactory conditions of detention in remand prisons represented a structural problem in  and that repeated applications to the Court in connection with this issue proved the existence and reality of the problem. Although the Russian authorities had undertaken some insignificant and sporadic measures to improve the conditions, those measures had proved to be insufficient owing to inadequate financing and the extensive use of custodial measures as a means of prevention.\n91: The applicants denied that they had at their disposal any effective domestic remedies for their complaints. Admittedly, a judicial complaint against unlawful actions by the prison administration in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure could, at least in theory, lead to a declaration of unlawfulness and a judicial order requiring the facility administration to remedy the situation. In practice, however, a detainee who filed such a complaint while still being under the full control of the prison administration, ran the risk of retaliation on the part of the prison warders. Besides, where all detainees were held in substantially similar conditions, the individual situation of the complainant could only be improved at the expense of other inmates and to their detriment. It would be impossible for the prison administration to comply with court orders if all or a majority of detainees filed complaints about the conditions of their detention.\n92: As to the possibility of claiming compensation for unsatisfactory conditions of detention, the applicants deemed that it was not sufficiently established in judicial practice to be considered effective. In any event, it had no preventive effect and a prospective claimant would be required to endure inhuman conditions of detention for a considerable period of time before filing such a claim. He would also be faced with a nearly insurmountable problem of collecting appropriate evidence: a majority of potential witnesses would be transferred to different facilities or correctional colonies located in remote regions. In addition, it had become an established judicial practice to deny the detained claimant the possibility of attending the hearing to state his position to the court in person (here they referred to the cases of Artyomov v. , no. 14146/02, 27 May 2010; Shilbergs v. , no. 20075/03, 17 December 2009; and Skorobogatykh v. , no. 4871/03, 22 December 2009). Likewise, it would be virtually impossible for a detainee to obtain copies of prison registers to which he had no access.\n93: The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before the Court to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity –, that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Kudła v.  [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000XI, and Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24).\n94: An applicant is normally required to have recourse only to those remedies that are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, inter alia, Vernillo v. France, 20 February 1991, § 27, Series A no. 198, and Johnston and Others v. Ireland, 18 December 1986, § 22, Series A no. 112). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement.\n95: The Court would emphasise that the application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, it has recognised that the rule of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Cardot v. , 19 March 1991, § 34, Series A no. 200). It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 35, Series A no. 40). This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Akdivar and Others v. , 16 September 1996, §§ 65-68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV).\n96: The scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint; the “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. At the same time, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. Even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kudła, cited above, §§ 157-158, and Wasserman v. Russia (no. 2), no. 21071/05, § 45, 10 April 2008).\n97: In the area of complaints about inhuman or degrading conditions of detention, the Court has already observed that two types of relief are possible: an improvement in the material conditions of detention and compensation for the damage or loss sustained on account of such conditions (see Roman Karasev v. Russia, no. 30251/03, § 79, 25 November 2010, and Benediktov, cited above, § 29). If an applicant has been held in conditions that are in breach of Article 3, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the ongoing violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, is of the greatest value. Once, however, the applicant has left the facility in which he or she endured the inadequate conditions, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred.\n98: Where the fundamental right to protection against torture, inhuman and degrading treatment is concerned, the preventive and compensatory remedies have to be complementary in order to be considered effective. In contrast to the cases concerning the length of judicial proceedings or non-enforcement of judgments, where the Court accepted in principle that a compensatory remedy alone might suffice (see Mifsud v.  (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, § 17, ECHR 2002VIII; Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 187, ECHR 2006V, and Burdov v.  (no. 2), no. 33509/04, § 99, ECHR 2009 ...), the existence of a preventive remedy is indispensable for the effective protection of individuals against the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3. Indeed, the special importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court’s view, that the States parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly. Had it been otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would have legitimised particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention and unacceptably weakened the legal obligation on the State to bring its standards of detention into line with the Convention requirements.\n99: The Court reiterates that it has examined the effectiveness of various domestic remedies suggested by the Russian Government in a number of cases concerning inadequate conditions of an applicant’s detention and found them to be lacking in many regards. On that basis, it has rejected the Government’s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and has also found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention. The Court has held in particular that the Government had not demonstrated what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by a prosecutor, a court, or another State agency, bearing in mind that the problems arising from the conditions of the applicant’s detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not concern the applicant’s personal situation alone (see, among recent authorities, Kozhokar v. Russia, no. 33099/08, §§ 92-93, 16 December 2010; Skachkov v. Russia, no. 25432/05, §§ 43-44, 7 October 2010; Vladimir Krivonosov v. Russia, no. 7772/04, §§ 82-84, 15 July 2010; Lutokhin, cited above, § 45; Skorobogatykh v. Russia, cited above, § 52; Aleksandr Makarov v. Russia, no. 15217/07, § 8789, 12 March 2009; Benediktov, cited above, §§ 27-30; and also Moiseyev (dec.), cited above). Nevertheless, the Court considers it important to review those findings in the light of the situation in the Russian legal system both on the date of the submission of the individual applications in the instant case and on the date of the present judgment. In doing so, it will depart from its ordinary practice of confining the scope of its review to the remedies explicitly invoked by the Government, but rather make a global assessment of the remedies available in the domestic legal system that appear prima facie capable of offering either preventive or compensatory relief to the aggrieved individual.\n100: The Pre-trial Detention Act establishes the detainee’s right to petition for an appointment with the prison governor or prison supervisors, with a view to stating his or her grievances (section 17 § 3, cited in paragraph 28 above). The Court observes that the prison governor is the official in charge of the detention facility with primary responsibility for ensuring the appropriate conditions of detention, whereas the prison supervisors are his or her direct superiors at regional level. It follows that a complaint about inadequate prison conditions would necessarily call into question the way in which they have discharged their duties and complied with the Pre-trial Detention Act.\n101: Accordingly, the Court does not consider that the prison authorities would have a sufficiently independent standpoint to satisfy the requirements of Article 13 (see Silver and Others v. the , 25 March 1983, § 113, Series A no. 61): in deciding on a complaint concerning conditions of detention for which they are responsible, they would in reality be judges in their own cause.\n102: In the Russian legal system, prosecutor’s offices have competence and responsibility, as well as dedicated staff, for overseeing compliance by the prison authorities with the applicable legal regulations. This function is regulated in Chapter 4 of the Prosecutors Act (see paragraph 36 above) and the prosecutors are entrusted with broad powers to carry out the task. They may pay unannounced visits to detention facilities, talk to detainees and study prison records, obtain statements from the prison officials and issue proceedings if a breach of the Pre-trial Detention Act has been detected. The prison authorities have a legal obligation to examine the prosecutor’s report on disclosed violations and report back to him or her within one month about the measures that have been taken (section 51 of the Pre-trial Detention Act and section 24 of the Prosecutors Act).\n103: It appears from the information submitted by the Russian Government to the Committee of Ministers, in the framework of the execution proceedings in respect of thirty-one judgments against  concerning conditions of detention in remand prisons, that prosecutors had carried out 4,290 inspections of remand prisons in 2008 and 4,646 inspections in 2009. During these inspections they had identified 1,330 and 2,491 cases of inadequate detention conditions, respectively, and issued 1,998 and 1,335 reports requiring the prison authorities to eliminate the violations. They had also instituted 52 and 168 court actions against the prison authorities, seeking to oblige them to comply with the domestic legislation (see point III.3 in Appendix II to Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35).\n104: Even though the prosecutors’ control undeniably plays an important part in securing appropriate conditions of detention, a complaint to the supervising prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy because of the procedural shortcomings that have been previously identified in the Court’s case-law (see, for instance, Pavlenko v. Russia, no. 42371/02, §§ 88-89, 1 April 2010; Aleksandr Makarov, § 86, and Benediktov, § 29, both cited above). Pursuant to section 17 § 7 of the Pre-trial Detention Act, detainees may send their complaints to a prosecutor. However, there is no legal requirement on the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings that would entirely be a matter between the supervising prosecutor and the supervised body. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. Moreover, the Court has already seen cases in which an applicant did complain to a prosecutor but his complaint did not elicit any response (see Antropov v. Russia, no. 22107/03, § 55, 29 January 2009). Since the complaint to a prosecutor about unsatisfactory conditions of detention does not give the person using it a personal right to the exercise by the State of its supervisory powers, it cannot be regarded as an effective remedy.\n105: The Court further observes that in some cases detainees have submitted complaints about inhuman or degrading conditions of their detention to a regional or the federal ombudsman (see, for instance, Gladkiy v. Russia, no. 3242/03, § 67, 21 December 2010). Even though the complainants have received a personal reply, the Court reiterates that, as a general rule, an application to an ombudsman cannot be regarded as an effective remedy as required by Article 35 of the Convention because the ombudsman has no power to render a binding decision granting redress (see Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, § 84, with further references).\n106: For a remedy to be considered effective it should be capable of providing redress for the complainant. Both the regional and the federal ombudsmen, however, lack the power to issue a legally binding decision that would be capable of bringing about an improvement in the complainant’s situation or would serve as a basis for obtaining compensation. Their task is different: they identify various human rights issues on the basis of individual complaints and other information at their disposal, highlight problems in their annual reports and work out solutions in co-operation with regional and federal authorities (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above). While their activities may usefully contribute to general improvement of conditions of detention, the ombudsmen remain unable, in view of their specific remit, to provide redress in individual cases as required by the Convention. It follows that recourse to an ombudsman does not constitute an effective remedy.\n107: By virtue of the provisions of Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Russian courts are endowed with a supervisory jurisdiction over any decision, action or inaction on the part of State officials and authorities that has violated individual rights and freedoms or prevented or excessively burdened the exercise thereof. Such claims must be submitted within three months of the alleged violation and adjudicated in a speedy fashion within ten days of the submission. In those proceedings, the complainant must demonstrate the existence of an interference with his or her rights or freedoms, whereas the respondent authority or official must prove that the impugned action or decision was lawful. The proceedings are to be conducted in accordance with the general rules of civil procedure (see paragraphs 37 to 40 above).\n108: If the complaint is found to be justified, the court will require the authority or official concerned to make good the violation of the complainant’s right and set a time-limit for doing so. The time-limit will be determined with regard to the nature of the violation and the efforts that need to be deployed to ensure its elimination. A report on the enforcement of the decision should reach the court and the complainant within one month of its service on the authority or official concerned (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above).\n109: The Court notes that judicial proceedings instituted in accordance with Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide a forum that guarantees due process of law and effective participation for the aggrieved individual. In such proceedings, courts can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint, make findings of fact and order redress that is tailored to the nature and gravity of the violation. The proceedings are conducted diligently and at no cost for the complainant. The ensuing judicial decision will be binding on the defaulting authority and enforceable against it. The Court is therefore satisfied that the existing legal framework renders this remedy prima facie accessible and capable, at least in theory, of affording appropriate redress.\n110: Nevertheless, in order to be “effective”, a remedy must be available not only in theory but also in practice. This means that the Government should normally be able to illustrate the practical effectiveness of the remedy with examples from the case-law of the domestic courts. The Russian Government, however, did not submit a single judicial decision showing that the complainant had been able to vindicate his or her rights by having recourse to this remedy. The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the conditions-of-detention cases that have previously come before it. The absence of an established judicial practice on this matter appears all the more baffling in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1 February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law no. 4866-1 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which Impaired Citizens’ Rights and Freedoms. The remedy, which has not produced a substantial body of case-law or a plethora of successful claims in more than eighteen years of existence, leaves genuine doubts as to its practical effectiveness. Admittedly, the ruling of the Plenary Supreme Court, which explicitly mentioned the right of detainees to complain under Chapter 25 about their conditions of detention, was only adopted in February 2009, but it did not alter the existing procedure in any significant way and its effectiveness in practice still remains to be demonstrated (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 in paragraph 60 above).\n111: Moreover, as the Court has noted in previous conditions-of-detention cases, the malfunctioning of such a preventive remedy in a situation of overcrowding is to a large extent due to the structural nature of the underlying problem. In the context of another structural problem in Russia, that of non-enforcement of final judicial decisions, the Court has already observed that the Russian courts’ capacity to order remedial action under Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure was essentially restricted to the issuing of a declaratory judgment reiterating what was in any case evident from the original judgment, namely that the State was to pay for its debts (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 103). In the instant case, as the applicants rightly pointed out, even if they were to obtain a judgment requiring the prison authorities to make good a violation of their right to an individual sleeping place and to the sanitary norm of floor surface, their personal situation in an already overcrowded facility could only be improved at the expense and to the detriment of other detainees. The prison governor of such a facility would obviously be in no position to enforce a large number of simultaneous judgments requiring him to remedy a violation of the detainees’ right to have at their disposal at least four metres of personal space.\n112: The Court finds that, although Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as clarified by the Supreme Court’s ruling of 10 February 2009, provides a solid theoretical legal framework for adjudicating the detainees’ complaints about inadequate conditions of detention, it falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy because its capacity to produce a preventive effect in practice has not been convincingly demonstrated.\n113: The Court finally has to consider whether the tort provisions of the Civil Code constituted an effective domestic remedy capable of providing an aggrieved individual with compensation for the detention that had already occurred in inhuman or degrading conditions. The Court has already examined this remedy in several recent cases, in the context of both Article 35 § 1 and Article 13 of the Convention, and was not satisfied that it was an effective one. The Court found that, while the possibility of obtaining compensation was not ruled out, the remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, in particular because the award was conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities (see, for instance, Roman Karasev v. Russia, no. 30251/03, §§ 81-85, 25 November 2010; Shilbergs, cited above, §§ 71-79; Kokoshkina v. Russia, no. 2052/08, § 52, 28 May 2009; Aleksandr Makarov, §§ 77 and 87-89; and Benediktov, §§ 29 and 30, both cited above; see also Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 109-116).\n114: The provisions of the Civil Code on tort liability impose special rules on compensation for damage caused by State authorities and officials. Articles 1070 and 1100 contain an exhaustive list of instances of strict liability in which the treasury is liable for the damage irrespective of the State officials’ fault. Inadequate conditions of detention do not appear in this list. Only the unlawful institution or conduct of criminal or administrative proceedings gives rise to strict liability; in all other cases, the general provision in Article 1069 applies, requiring the claimant to show that the damage was caused through an unlawful action or omission on the part of a State authority or official.\n115: The Court has already had occasion to criticise as unduly formalistic the approach of Russian courts based on the requirement of formal unlawfulness of the authorities’ actions. In the Aleksandr Makarov case, Mr Makarov’s detention in most aspects, including the lighting, food, medical assistance, sanitary conditions, etc., complied with domestic legal regulations, yet their cumulative effect was such as to constitute inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, §§ 98-100). The Court found it questionable whether, in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed such conditions of his detention, Mr Makarov would have been able to argue his case effectively before a court, and noted that such approach by the Russian courts offered no prospect of success for his tort action and rendered this remedy theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective (ibid., §§ 88-89; see also Silver and Others, cited above, §§ 117-118, in which the jurisdiction of the English courts was limited to determining whether or not the prison authorities had exercised their powers in compliance with the Prison Act and the Rules).\n116: Even in cases where the claimant was able to prove that the actual conditions of detention deviated from, or fell short of, the standards required by applicable Russian laws, the Russian courts have routinely absolved the State of tort liability, finding that the inadequacy of material conditions was not attributable to some shortcoming or omission on the part of the prison authorities but rather to a structural problem, such as insufficient funding of the penitentiary system. Thus, in the Skorobogatykh case, the Russian courts acknowledged the accuracy of Mr Skorobogatykh’s allegations of severe overcrowding in the remand prison where he had been detained, but rejected his claim against the State, noting that the overcrowding was due to “objective reasons” (see Skorobogatykh, cited above, §§ 17-18 and 31-32). In another case the Russian courts explicitly stated that the prison management and State authorities in general could not be held liable in tort for the overcrowded cells and the state of disrepair into which the remand prison had fallen, owing to a lack of funding from the federal budget (see Artyomov, cited above, §§ 16-18 and 111-112). A similar situation obtained in the Roman Karasev case, where the courts consistently absolved the authorities of all liability, citing “objective factors” (see Roman Karasev, cited above, §§ 17, 24 and 82). As the Court put it, the applicant’s claim did not fail because of a lack or non-substantiation of justiciable damage but because of the provisions of the applicable legislation, as interpreted and applied by the domestic courts (ibid., § 85). The Court considered this approach adopted by the Russian courts unacceptable because it allowed a large number of well-founded cases where the unsatisfactory conditions of detention resulted from a lack of funds or a limited capacity of detention facilities, to remain unresolved at the domestic level (see Artyomov, cited above, § 112; also compare Orchowski v. , no. 17885/04, § 108, ECHR 2009... (extracts), where the Polish courts had considered that the policy of reducing the space for each individual in overcrowded establishments was in accordance with domestic law).\n117: Finally, the Court notes that even in cases where the Russian courts awarded compensation for conditions of detention that had been unsatisfactory in the light of the domestic legal requirements, the level of the compensation was unreasonably low in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see, for instance, Shilbergs, cited above, where the applicant was awarded RUB 1,500, that is less than 50 euros (EUR), for his detention in an extremely cold and humid cell, without adequate lighting, food or a personal sleeping place). In the Shilbergs case, the Court was furthermore concerned with the reasoning of the Russian courts, which had assessed the amount of compensation by reference in particular to the “degree of responsibility of the management and its lack of financial resources”. The Court accepted that, applying the compensatory principle, national courts might make an award taking into account the motives and conduct of the defendant and making due allowance for the circumstances in which the wrong was committed. However, it reiterated its finding made in a number of cases that financial or logistical difficulties, as well as the lack of a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, could not be relied upon by the domestic authorities as circumstances relieving them of their obligation to organise the State’s penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees (see, among other authorities, Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 63, 1 June 2006). The Court found it anomalous for the domestic courts to decrease the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for a wrong committed by the State by referring to the latter’s lack of funds. It considered that in circumstances such as those under consideration the scarcity of means available to the State should not be accepted as mitigating its conduct, and were thus irrelevant in assessing damages under the compensatory criterion. Furthermore, the Court emphasised that the domestic courts, as the custodians of individual rights and freedoms, should have felt it their duty to mark their disapproval of the State’s wrongful conduct to the extent of awarding an adequate and sufficient quantum of damages to the applicant, taking into account the fundamental importance of the right of which they had found a breach, even if they considered that breach to have been an inadvertent rather than an intended consequence of the State’s conduct. As a corollary this would have conveyed the message that the State could not set individual rights and freedoms at nought or circumvent them with impunity (see Shilbergs, cited above, § 71-79).\n118: In the light of the above considerations, the Court is not satisfied that the present state of the Russian law allows tort claimants to recover adequate damages on proof of their allegations of inhuman or degrading conditions of detention. The Court is not prepared, therefore, to change its position, as expressed in previous cases, that a civil claim for damages incurred in connection with inhuman or degrading conditions of detention does not satisfy the criteria of an effective remedy that offers both a reasonable prospect of success and adequate redress.\n119: In the light of the above considerations, the Court concludes that for the time being the Russian legal system does not provide an effective remedy that could be used to prevent the alleged violation or its continuation and provide the applicant with adequate and sufficient redress in connection with a complaint about inadequate conditions of detention. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and finds that the applicants did not have at their disposal an effective domestic remedy for their grievances, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention.\n120: The applicants complained under Article 3 of the Convention that they had been detained at remand prisons IZ-67/1 (Mr Ananyev) and IZ-30/1 (Mr Bashirov) in conditions that had been so harsh as to constitute inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of this provision, which reads as follows:\n121: The Court reiterates that allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, among others, Nachova and Others v.  [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005VII; Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and  [GC], no. 48787/99, § 26, ECHR 2004VII; and Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 168).\n122: The Court is mindful of the objective difficulties experienced by the applicants in collecting evidence to substantiate their claims about the conditions of their detention. Owing to the restrictions imposed by the prison regime, detainees cannot realistically be expected to be able to furnish photographs of their cell or give precise measurements of its dimensions, temperature or luminosity. Nevertheless, an applicant must provide an elaborate and consistent account of the conditions of his or her detention mentioning the specific elements, such as for instance the dates of his or her transfer between facilities, which would enable the Court to determine that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded or inadmissible on any other grounds. Only a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention constitutes a prima facie case of ill-treatment and serves as a basis for giving notice of the complaint to the respondent Government.\n123: The Court has held on many occasions that cases concerning allegations of inadequate conditions of detention do not lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation) because in such instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. It follows that, after the Court has given notice of the applicant’s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce relevant documents. A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence on material conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant’s allegations (see Gubin v. Russia, no. 8217/04, § 56, 17 June 2010, and Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, § 113, ECHR 2005X (extracts)).\n124: In previous conditions-of-detention cases, the extent of factual disclosure by the Russian Government was rather limited and the supporting evidence they produced habitually consisted in a series of certificates issued by the director of the impugned detention facility after they had been given notice of the complaint. The Court repeatedly pointed out that such certificates lacked references to the original prison documentation and were apparently based on personal recollections rather than on any objective data and, for that reason, were of little evidentiary value (see, among other authorities, Veliyev v. Russia, no. 24202/05, § 127, 24 June 2010; Igor Ivanov v. Russia, no. 34000/02, § 34, 7 June 2007; and Belashev, cited above, § 52).\n125: The Court emphasised that in every case the Government had to account properly for the failure to submit the original records, in particular those concerning the number of inmates detained together with the applicant. The Government frequently advanced the explanation that the complaint had been communicated to them after a considerable lapse of time and that by then the original prison documentation had been destroyed upon the expiry of the time-limit for its safe-keeping. In this connection the Court noted that the destruction of the relevant documents did not absolve the Government from the obligation to support their factual submissions with appropriate evidence. Moreover, it often found that the Russian authorities did not appear to have acted with due care and diligence in handling the prison records because some of them had actually been destroyed after the Government had been put on notice that the Court was dealing with the case (see Shcherbakov v. Russia, no. 23939/02, § 78, 17 June 2010; Gultyayeva, cited above, § 154; and Novinskiy v. Russia, no. 11982/02, §§ 102-103, 10 February 2009). In other cases the Government did submit extracts from the original prison records but they were too disparate and spaced out in time to present a credible refutation of the applicant’s claim of severe overcrowding at the material time (see Gubin, § 54; Kokoshkina, § 32, both cited above; and Sudarkov v. Russia, no. 3130/03, § 43, 10 July 2008).\n126: The Court notes with regret that the regulation on the functioning of the department of prison records (отдел специального учета) has never been published and appears to have been classified as being for internal use only. Accordingly, the limited knowledge the Court has of the accounting and statistical forms used in the Russian penitentiary system is based on the sample prison documents that the Government have produced in past and present cases. Of those, the prison population register and cell records of individual detainees are of particular value for the assessment of a claim of overcrowding.\n127: The prison population register (книга количественного учета лиц, содержащихся в следственном изоляторе) is filled out by morning and night shifts of prison warders with information about the number of detainees present in each cell. The information entered into the page-wide table includes the cell number and two figures representing the number of sleeping places in the cell and the actual number of inmates. It is signed by the warders on duty from the outgoing and incoming shifts.\n128: A cell record (камерная карточка) is an index card filled in upon a new detainee’s arrival at the remand prison. It contains his or her name, date of birth, information on past convictions and on-going criminal proceedings, and inventories of his or her personal belongings and of the items that were given to him or her in prison. All cell transfers are recorded in a separate table and show the cell number and transfer date.\n129: Read together, the prison population register and cell records are capable of presenting both a general situation in the entire prison during the relevant period of time and the specific situation in the applicant’s cell. They enable the Court to see whether or not and how severely the overcrowding problem affected the detention facility and, if inmates were unevenly distributed among the cells, whether or not the applicant’s cell was filled beyond design capacity. They also allow the Court to verify that the inmates whose statements may have been produced by an applicant in support of his or her allegations had actually shared the cell with the applicant during the specified period.\n130: The recognition of the utility of the aforementioned records for the establishment of facts in a conditions-of-detention case is, however, without prejudice to the use of any other evidence that the parties may wish to submit in such a case. As noted above, the Convention proceedings lay down no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. The Court’s findings of fact are based on a global evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties’ submissions.\n131: Mr Ananyev was held in the  remand prison IZ-67/1 from 20 January to 23 March 2007. During his two months’ stay he was accommodated in cell 170, save for the last two days.\n132: Cell 170 measured 15 square metres and featured 13 sleeping places. The parties agreed that the cell was filled beyond the design capacity and that its population peaked at 21 prisoners. This is confirmed by the applicant’s own submissions, written statements from his co-detainees, and the extracts from the prison population register produced by the Government.\n133: The Court finds it established that Mr Ananyev had at his disposal less than 1.25 square metres of personal space and that the number of detainees significantly exceeded the number of sleeping places available.\n134: Mr Bashirov was held in the  remand prison IZ-30/1 for more than three years, from 3 May 2005 to 21 May 2008. He stayed in five different cells and, for one week in December 2007, in the prison hospital.\n135: All of Mr Bashirov’s cells were similar in size, in the range of 23 to 25 square metres, and were designed to provide sleeping accommodation to 10 or 12 persons. As to the actual cell population, Mr Bashirov gave numbers that significantly exceeded the number of sleeping places, whereas the Government denied the existence of overpopulation.\n136: The Court notes that in the case of Mr Bashirov the Government did not submit any original documents showing the actual number of inmates or account for the absence of such documents. They solely referred to a certificate which had been issued by the prison governor in June 2009, that is more than four years after Mr Bashirov’s detention had begun and one year after it had come to an end. The certificate did not specify the actual number of detainees during any specific period of Mr Bashirov’s detention; it merely asserted that it “had not exceeded the number of sleeping places”. As the Court has pointed out on many occasions when the Government failed to submit original records, documents prepared after a considerable period of time cannot be viewed as sufficiently reliable sources, given the length of time that has elapsed.\n137: On the other hand, Mr Bashirov’s assertion of severe overpopulation is corroborated by extracts from annual reports by the regional Ombudsman (compare Gladkiy, § 67, and Roman Karasev, § 11, both cited above, in which the Ombudsman of the Kaliningrad Region reported a serious overcrowding issue in prison IZ-39/1). The reports for the years from 2005 to 2008 deplored poor sanitary and hygienic conditions of detention in prison IZ-30/1 and indicated that the prison had been filled at all times well beyond its design capacity. The actual number of detainees at the end of 2005 and 2006 was more than double the capacity. Even though the situation had somewhat improved by the end of 2008, the Ombudsman pointed out that the estimated design capacity had been set too high to ensure compliance with the domestic sanitary norm of four square metres per person.\n138: Having regard to the material presented by Mr Bashirov in support of his assertions, together with the fact that the Government did not submit any credible evidence to the contrary, the Court finds that the cells were overcrowded and that Mr Bashirov was provided with less than two square metres of personal space.\n139: The Court reiterates that Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of a democratic society. It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim’s behaviour (see, for example, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 162, Series A no. 25).\n140: Ill-treatment that attains such a minimum level of severity usually involves actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering. However, even in the absence of these, where treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for or diminishing his or her human dignity, or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual’s moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition of Article 3 (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 52, ECHR 2002-III, with further references).\n141: In the context of deprivation of liberty the Court has consistently stressed that, to fall under Article 3, the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering and humiliation connected with the detention. The State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kudła, cited above, §§ 92-94, and Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, § 208, 13 July 2006).\n142: When assessing conditions of detention, account has to be taken of the cumulative effects of these conditions, as well as of specific allegations made by the applicant (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, § 46, ECHR 2001-II). The length of the period during which a person is detained in the particular conditions also has to be considered (see, among other authorities, Alver v. , no. 64812/01, 8 November 2005).\n143: The extreme lack of space in a prison cell weighs heavily as an aspect to be taken into account for the purpose of establishing whether the impugned detention conditions were “degrading” from the point of view of Article 3 (see Karalevičius v. Lithuania, no. 53254/99, § 36, 7 April 2005).\n144: The Court notes that the General Reports published by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture do not appear to contain an explicit indication as to what amount of living space per inmate should be considered the minimum standard for a multi-occupancy prison cell. It transpires, however, from the individual country reports on the CPT’s visits and the recommendations following on those reports that the desirable standard for the domestic authorities, and the objective they should attain, should be the provision of four square metres of living space per person in pre-trial detention facilities (see, among others, CPT/Inf (2006) 24 [Albania], § 93; CPT/Inf (2004) 36 [Azerbaijan], § 87; CPT/Inf (2008) 11 [Bulgaria], §§ 55, 77; CPT/Inf (2008) 29 [Croatia], §§ 56, 71; CPT/Inf (2007) 42 [Georgia], §§ 42, 51, 61, 74; CPT/Inf (2009) 22 [Lithuania], § 35; CPT/Inf (2006) 11 [Poland], §§ 87, 101, 111; CPT/Inf (2009) 1 [Serbia], § 49, and CPT/Inf (2008) 22 [FYRO Macedonia], § 38).\n145: Whereas the provision of four square metres remains the desirable standard of multi-occupancy accommodation, the Court has found that where the applicants have at their disposal less than three square metres of floor surface, the overcrowding must be considered to be so severe as to justify of itself a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see, among many other authorities, Trepashkin (no. 2), § 113, and Kozhokar, § 96, both cited above; Svetlana Kazmina v. Russia, no. 8609/04, § 70, 2 December 2010; Kovaleva v. Russia, no. 7782/04, § 56, 2 December 2010; Roman Karasev, cited above, §§ 48-49; Aleksandr Leonidovich Ivanov v. Russia, no. 33929/03, § 35, 23 September 2010; Vladimir Krivonosov, § 93, and Gubin, § 57, both cited above; Salakhutdinov v. Russia, no. 43589/02, § 72, 11 February 2010; Denisenko and Bogdanchikov v. Russia, no. 3811/02, § 98, 12 February 2009; Guliyev, cited above, § 32; Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 59, 6 December 2007; Kantyrev v. Russia, no. 37213/02, §§ 50-51, 21 June 2007; Andrey Frolov v. Russia, no. 205/02, §§ 47-49, 29 March 2007; Labzov v. Russia, no. 62208/00, § 44, 16 June 2005; and Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 40, 20 January 2005).\n146: In some earlier cases, the number of detainees exceeded the number of sleeping places in the cell and insufficiency of floor surface was further aggravated by the lack of an individual sleeping place. Inmates had to take turns to sleep (see Gusev v. Russia, no. 67542/01, § 57, 15 May 2008; Dorokhov v. Russia, no. 66802/01, § 58, 14 February 2008; Bagel v. Russia, no. 37810/03, § 61, 15 November 2007; Babushkin v. Russia, no. 67253/01, § 44, 18 October 2007; Igor Ivanov, § 36, Benediktov, § 36, Khudoyorov, § 106, Romanov, § 77, and Labzov, § 45, all cited above; and Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, § 97, ECHR 2002VI).\n147: Where the cell accommodated not so many detainees but was rather small in overall size, the Court noted that, deduction being made of the place occupied by bunk beds, a table, and a cubicle in which a lavatory pan was placed, the remaining floor space was hardly sufficient even to pace out the cell (see Yevgeniy Alekseyenko v. , no. 41833/04, § 87, 27 January 2011; Petrenko v. Russia, no. 30112/04, § 39, 20 January 2011; Gladkiy, § 68, Trepashkin (no. 2), § 113, both cited above; Arefyev v. Russia, no. 29464/03, § 59, 4 November 2010; and Lutokhin, cited above, § 57).\n148: It follows that, in deciding whether or not there has been a violation of Article 3 on account of the lack of personal space, the Court has to have regard to the following three elements:\n149: In cases where the inmates appeared to have at their disposal sufficient personal space, the Court noted other aspects of physical conditions of detention as being relevant for the assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, access to outdoor exercise, natural light or air, availability of ventilation, adequacy of heating arrangements, the possibility of using the toilet in private, and compliance with basic sanitary and hygienic requirements. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of three to four square metres per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Vlasov v. Russia, no. 78146/01, § 84, 12 June 2008; Babushkin, cited above, § 44; and Trepashkin v. Russia, no. 36898/03, § 94, 19 July 2007).\n150: Of the other elements relevant for the assessment of the conditions of detention, special attention must be paid to the availability and duration of outdoor exercise and the conditions in which prisoners could take it. The Prison Standards developed by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture make specific mention of outdoor exercise and consider it a basic safeguard of prisoners’ well-being that all of them, without exception, be allowed at least one hour of exercise in the open air every day and preferably as part of a broader programme of out-of-cell activities. The Standards emphasise that outdoor exercise facilities should be reasonably spacious and whenever possible offer shelter from inclement weather (see paragraph 48 of the 2nd General Report, cited in paragraph 56 above).\n151: The Court has frequently observed that a short duration of outdoor exercise limited to one hour a day was a factor that further exacerbated the situation of the applicant, who was confined to his cell for the rest of the time without any kind of freedom of movement (see, most recently, Yevgeniy Alekseyenko, § 88, Gladkiy, § 69, and Skachkov, § 54, all cited above). In one case the applicant’s situation was even worse because the exercise yard had been closed for renovation and he was forced to stay indoors for more than a month (see Trepashkin, cited above, §§ 32 and 94).\n152: The physical characteristics of outdoor exercise facilities also featured prominently in the Court’s analysis. In Moiseyev v. Russia, the exercise yards in a Moscow prison were just two square metres larger than the cells and hardly afforded any real possibility for exercise. The yards were surrounded by three-metre-high walls with an opening to the sky protected with metal bars and a thick net. The Court considered that the restricted space coupled with the lack of openings undermined the facilities available for recreation and recuperation (see Moiseyev v. , no. 62936/00, § 125, 9 October 2008).\n153: The Court has constantly emphasised the importance of giving prisoners unobstructed and sufficient access to natural light and fresh air within their cells. Until the early 2000s Russian remand prisons were equipped with metal shutters or inclined plates fitted to windows, which had apparently been designed to prevent communication between prisoners. As the Committee for the Prevention of Torture noted, not only did such contraptions have the effect of depriving prisoners of access to natural light and preventing fresh air from entering the accommodation but they also created conditions favourable to the spread of diseases and in particular tuberculosis (see paragraph 30 of the 11th General Report, cited in paragraph 56 above).\n154: In the Court’s view, restrictions on access to natural light and air owing to the fitting of metal shutters seriously aggravated the situation of prisoners in an already overcrowded cell and weighed heavily in favour of a violation of Article 3 (see Goroshchenya, § 71, Salakhutdinov, § 73, Shilbergs, § 97, all cited above; Grigoryevskikh v. Russia, no. 22/03, § 64, 9 April 2009; Aleksandr Makarov, § 96, Belashev, § 59, Moiseyev, § 125, Vlasov, § 82, all cited above; and Novoselov v. Russia, no. 66460/01, § 44, 2 June 2005). However, absent any indications of overcrowding or malfunctioning of the ventilation system and artificial lighting, the negative impact of shutters did not reach, on its own, the threshold of severity required under Article 3 (see Pavlenko, cited above, §§ 81-82, and Matyush v. Russia, no. 14850/03, § 58, 9 December 2008).\n155: The Court has also made it clear that the free flow of natural air should not be confused with inappropriate exposure to inclement outside conditions, including extreme heat in summer or freezing temperatures in winter. In some cases the applicants found themselves in particularly harsh conditions because the cell window was fitted with shutters but lacked glazing. As a result, they suffered both from inadequate access to natural light and air and from exposure to low winter temperatures, having no means to shield themselves from the cold freely penetrating into the cell from the outside (see Zakharkin, §§ 125-127, Gultyayeva, §§ 159-162, both cited above, and Starokadomskiy v. Russia, no. 42239/02, § 45, 31 July 2008).\n156: The Court considers, as does the Committee for the Prevention of Torture, that access to properly equipped and hygienic sanitary facilities is of paramount importance for maintaining the inmates’ sense of personal dignity (see paragraph 49 of the 2nd General Report, cited in paragraph 56 above). Not only are hygiene and cleanliness integral parts of the respect that individuals owe to their bodies and to their neighbours with whom they share premises for long periods of time, they also constitute a condition and at the same time a necessity for the conservation of health. A truly humane environment is not possible without ready access to toilet facilities or the possibility of keeping one’s body clean (see point 15 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and point 19.4 of the European Prison Rules, cited in paragraphs 55 and 58 above, respectively).\n157: As regards access to toilets, the Court has noted in many cases that in Russian remand prisons the lavatory pan was placed in the corner of the cell and either lacked any separation from the living area or was separated by a single partition approximately one to one a half metres high. Such close proximity and exposure was not only objectionable from a hygiene perspective but also deprived a detainee using the toilet of any privacy because he remained at all times in full view of other inmates sitting on the bunks and also of warders looking through the peephole (see, among other authorities, Aleksandr Makarov, § 97, Trepashkin, § 94, Grishin, § 94, and Kalashnikov, § 99, all cited above). In one case the Court considered that the lack of privacy resulting from the openness of the toilet area must have taken a particularly heavy toll on the applicant, who was undergoing treatment for haemorrhoids and had to apply his medication in front of his cellmates and warders (see Moiseyev, cited above, § 124).\n158: The Court has frequently noted that the time for taking a shower which has normally been afforded to inmates in Russian remand prisons has been limited to fifteen to twenty minutes once a week and has been manifestly insufficient for maintaining proper bodily hygiene. The way the showering was organised did not afford the detainees any elementary privacy, for they were taken to shower halls as a group, one cell after another, and the number of functioning shower heads was occasionally too small to accommodate all of them (see Goroshchenya, § 71, Shilbergs, § 97, Aleksandr Makarov, § 99, Seleznev, § 44, Grishin, § 94, and Romanov, § 79, all cited above).\n159: Finally, the necessary sanitary precautions should include measures against infestation with rodents, fleas, lice, bedbugs and other vermin. Such measures comprise sufficient and adequate disinfection facilities, provision of detergent products, and regular fumigation and checkups of the cells and in particular bed linen, mattresses and the areas used for keeping food. This is an indispensable element for the prevention of skin diseases, such as scabies, which appear to have been a common occurrence in Russian remand prisons (see Kozhokar, § 87, Shcherbakov, § 14, Buzhinayev, § 17, Grigoryevskikh, § 25, Belashev, §§ 34-35, Novoselov, § 23, and Kalashnikov, §§ 18 and 29, all cited above).\n160: The Court will now proceed to assess, in the light of the above-mentioned general principles and requirements, whether or not the facts, as established above, disclosed a violation of Article 3 in relation to the applicants.\n161: The present case concerned the conditions of detention in two different remand prisons: Smolensk prison IZ-67/1 and  prison IZ-30/1. The Court found it established, to the standard required under Article 3 of the Convention, that at the material time both of those prisons were plagued with a severe shortage of personal space available to inmates.\n162: The applicant Mr Bashirov in the  prison was held in conditions that provided no more than two square metres of floor surface per inmate (see paragraph 138 above). The situation of the applicant Mr Ananyev was even worse: not only was the personal space per detainee marginally greater than one square metre, but also the number of detainees per cell significantly exceeded the number of sleeping places (see paragraph 133 above).\n163: In the light of the parties’ submissions and the legal and normative regulations regarding the regime in Russian remand prisons, as applicable at the material time (see paragraph 26 et seq. above), the Court considers the following additional elements to be established.\n164: The applicants were allowed a one-hour period of outdoor exercise daily. Windows were not fitted with metal shutters or other contraptions preventing natural light from penetrating into the cell. Where available, a small window pane could be opened for fresh air. Cells were additionally equipped with artificial lighting and ventilation.\n165: As regards sanitary and hygiene conditions, both the dining table and the lavatory pan were located inside the applicants’ cells, sometimes as close to each other as one or one and a half metres. A partition, approximately one to one a half metres in height, separated the toilet on one side; the prison regulations did not allow the toilet to be completely shielded from view by means of a door or a curtain. Cold running water was normally available in cells and detainees had access to showers once every seven to ten days.\n166: It has been established that the applicants Mr Ananyev and Mr Bashirov were afforded less than three square metres of personal space. They remained inside the cell all the time, except for a one-hour period of outside exercise; they had to have their meals and answer the calls of nature in those cramped conditions. As far as Mr Bashirov is concerned, it is noted that he spent in those conditions more than three years. The Court therefore considers that the applicants Mr Ananyev and Mr Bashirov were subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.\n167: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n168: The applicant Mr Bashirov claimed interest on the money which had been seized from his flat during a search in 2005. The Government pointed out that on 17 July 2009 a district court had directed the authorities to return the money to him but he had not submitted a writ of enforcement to the bailiffs. The Court notes that the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was declared inadmissible and rejects this claim for pecuniary damage.\n169: The applicant Mr Ananyev claimed EUR 2,000 and the applicant Mr Bashirov EUR 50,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n170: The Government considered their claims to be excessive.\n171: The Court has found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the two applicants who were subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment on account of the inadequate conditions of their detention. It has also found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention since they did not have at their disposal an effective domestic remedy.\n172: As regards compensation in respect of a violation of Article 3, the Court considers that the suffering and frustration caused to an individual who was detained in manifestly inappropriate conditions cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation. The length of stay in such conditions is undeniably the single most important factor that is relevant for the assessment of the extent of non-pecuniary damage. It is also known that an initial period of adjustment to poor conditions exacts a particularly heavy mental and physical toll on the individual. Having regard to the fundamental nature of the right protected by Article 3, the Court finds it appropriate to award Mr Bashirov EUR 6,000 for the first year of his detention in inhuman and degrading conditions and EUR 3,500 for each subsequent year, that is the global amount of EUR 13,000. As to Mr Ananyev, the Court considers it reasonable to award him the full amount he claimed, that is EUR 2,000.\n173: As regards the violation of Article 13, the Court holds that the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction.\n174: Having regard to the above principles, the Court awards Mr Ananyev EUR 2,000 and Mr Bashirov EUR 13,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable, and rejects the remainder of the claims under this head.\n175: The applicant Mr Ananyev did not claim any costs or expenses. The applicant Mr Bashirov claimed RUB 35,800 in domestic legal fees and RUB 11,908 in copying and postal expenses. The Government submitted that the domestic legal fees were not connected with the subject matter of the  proceedings and that the postal receipts only confirmed the amount of RUB 4,191.\n176: According to the Court’s established case-law, costs and expenses will not be awarded under Article 41 unless it is established that they were actually incurred, were necessarily incurred and are also reasonable as to quantum (see Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, § 54, ECHR 2000-XI).\n177: In the case of Mr Bashirov, a portion of his complaints was declared inadmissible. Regard being had to the documents in its possession, the Court considers it reasonable to award Mr Bashirov the sum of EUR 850 covering costs under all heads, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him.\n178: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\n179: The Court notes that inadequate conditions of detention appear to constitute a recurrent problem in  which has led it to find violations of Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention in more than eighty judgments that have been adopted since the first such finding in the Kalashnikov case in 2002. The Court therefore considers it timely and appropriate to examine the present case under Article 46 of the Convention which reads, in the relevant part, as follows:\n180: The Court recalls that Article 46 of the Convention, as interpreted in the light of Article 1, imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation to implement, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, appropriate general and/or individual measures to secure the right of the applicant which the Court found to be violated. Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant’s position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court’s findings (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 120, ECHR 2002-VI; Lukenda v. Slovenia, no. 23032/02, § 94, ECHR 2005-X; and S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 134, ECHR 2008 ...). This obligation has consistently been emphasised by the Committee of Ministers in the supervision of the execution of the Court’s judgments (see, among many authorities, Interim Resolutions DH(97)336 in cases concerning the length of proceedings in Italy; DH(99)434 in cases concerning the action of the security forces in Turkey; ResDH(2001)65 in the case of Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy; ResDH(2006)1 in the cases of Ryabykh and Volkova v. Russia).\n181: In order to facilitate effective implementation of its judgments along these lines, the Court may adopt a pilot-judgment procedure allowing it to clearly identify in a judgment the existence of structural problems underlying the violations and to indicate specific measures or actions to be taken by the respondent State to remedy them (see Broniowski v. Poland [GC], 31443/96, §§ 189-194 and the operative part, ECHR 2004-V, and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland [GC] no. 35014/97, ECHR 2006-... §§ 231-239 and the operative part). This adjudicative approach is, however, pursued with due respect for the Convention organs’ respective functions: it falls to the Committee of Ministers to evaluate the implementation of individual and general measures under Article 46 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland (friendly settlement) [GC], no. 31443/96, § 42, ECHR 2005-IX, and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland (friendly settlement) [GC], no. 35014/97, § 42, 28 April 2008).\n182: Another important aim of the pilot-judgment procedure is to induce the respondent State to resolve large numbers of individual cases arising from the same structural problem at the domestic level, thus implementing the principle of subsidiarity which underpins the Convention system. Indeed, the Court’s task, as defined by Article 19, that is to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in a large series of cases (see, mutatis mutandis, E.G. v. Poland (dec.), no. 50425/99, § 27, 23 September 2008). The object of the pilot-judgment procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention rights in question in the national legal order (see Wolkenberg and Others v. Poland (dec.), no. 50003/99, § 34, ECHR 2007 ... (extracts)). While the respondent State’s action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction, where appropriate, of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements. The Court may decide to adjourn examination of all similar cases, thus giving the respondent State an opportunity to settle them in such various ways (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski, cited above, § 198, and Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey, no. 46347/99, § 50, 22 December 2005).\n183: If, however, the respondent State fails to adopt such measures following a pilot judgment and continues to violate the Convention, the Court will have no choice but to resume examination of all similar applications pending before it and to take them to judgment so as to ensure effective observance of the Convention (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 128).\n184: Since its first judgment concerning the inhuman and degrading conditions of detention in Russian pre-trial remand centres (see Kalashnikov, cited above), the Court has found a violation of Article 3 on account of similar conditions of detention in more than eighty cases (see Annex). A number of those judgments also concluded that there had been a violation of Article 13 on account of the absence of any effective domestic remedies for the applicants’ complaints about the conditions of their detention. According to the Court’s case management database, there are at present approximately two hundred and fifty prima facie meritorious applications against  awaiting first examination which feature, as their primary grievance, a complaint about inadequate conditions of detention. The above numbers, taken on their own, are indicative of the existence of a recurrent structural problem (see, among other authorities, Bottazzi v. Italy [GC], no. 34884/97, § 22, ECHR 1999-V; Lukenda, cited above, §§ 90-93; and Rumpf v. , no. 46344/06, §§ 64-70, 2 September 2010).\n185: The violations of Article 3 found in the previous judgments, as well as those found in the present case, originated in remand centres that were located in various administrative entities of the  and in geographically diverse regions. Nevertheless, the set of facts underlying these violations was substantially similar: detainees suffered inhuman and degrading treatment on account of an acute lack of personal space in their cells, a shortage of sleeping places, unjustified restrictions on access to natural light and air, and non-existent privacy when using the sanitary facilities. It appears, therefore, that the violations were neither prompted by an isolated incident, nor attributable to a particular turn of events in those cases, but originated in a widespread problem resulting from a malfunctioning of the Russian penitentiary system and insufficient legal and administrative safeguards against the proscribed kind of treatment. This problem has affected, and has remained capable of affecting, a large number of individuals who have been detained in remand centres throughout  (compare Broniowski, § 189, and Hutten-Czapska, § 229, both cited above).\n186: It is further recalled that the obligation to improve without delay the “practically inhuman conditions” in pre-trial detention centres in line with Recommendation R(87)3 on European prison rules (cited in paragraph 58 above) was one of the accession commitments of the Russian Federation which it undertook to implement when joining the Council of Europe (see Parliamentary Assembly’s Opinion No. 193 (1996), § 7 (ix)). In its Resolution 1277 (2002) on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation, the Parliamentary Assembly noted a sharp decrease in the numbers of detainees in custodial institutions but deplored detention conditions, in particular prison overcrowding, poor health care and insufficient financing. It called on Russian authorities to improve the conditions in pre-trial detention centres and ensure respect for the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to implement the recommendations made by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (point 8 (ix)). A more recent report by the Monitoring Committee on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation (Doc. 10568, 3 June 2005) noted that, as a result of mass amnesties, the use of alternative sentencing and reduction of penalties in the Criminal Code, as well as the transfer of competence for the ordering and extending of pre-trial detention from prosecutors to courts, and the construction of new remand centres, the average overcrowding in pre-trial detention had been reduced to only one per cent above the facilities’ normal capacity. Nevertheless, a detailed region-by-region analysis showed that pre-trial detention centres remained overcrowded at different levels in thirty-four regions: in fifteen of them the overcrowding is less than 20%, in sixteen between 20 and 50%. In three regions – the Tuva Republic, the Chita and Kostroma regions – the pre-trial detention facilities remained more severely overcrowded (§§ 204-210 of the report).\n187: Since the adoption of the Kalashnikov judgment in 2002, the problem of overcrowding in Russian remand centres has featured prominently on the agenda of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention. In its first Interim Resolution concerning the execution of the Kalashnikov judgment, the Committee of Ministers noted that the problem of overcrowding plagued remand centres in fifty-seven out of eighty-nine Russian regions and that prompt action was necessary to remedy the problem and to align the sanitary conditions of detention with the requirements of the Convention (Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2003)123, cited in paragraph 59 above). A second interim resolution adopted in 2010 concerned the execution of the Kalashnikov judgment and thirty-one further similar judgments that the Court had issued in the meantime (Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited in paragraph 60 above). The resolution recalled that the existence of structural problems and the pressing need for comprehensive general measures had been stressed by the Committee of Ministers and acknowledged by the Russian authorities, and reiterated the need for an integrated approach to finding solutions to the problem of overcrowding in remand prisons, including in particular changes to the legal framework, practices and attitudes.\n188: The Russian authorities did not deny the existence of a structural problem related to overcrowding in pre-trial detention facilities. Its magnitude and urgency were acknowledged both in the Government’s submissions in the present case and in the documents and position papers adopted at national level, such as for instance the Federal Programme for Development of the Penitentiary of 5 September 2006 (cited in paragraph 54 above). The Programme expressly referred to Russia’s accession commitments and the standards for pre-trial detention set by the Court and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and declared as its objective the alignment of the conditions of detention with the Russian legal norms and further transition to international standards. Taking stock of the situation in the penitentiary system, it noted that only forty Russian regions possessed facilities capable of providing accommodation to detainees in accordance with the domestic sanitary norm of four square metres per inmate, whereas pre-trial detention centres in eighteen regions could offer less than three square metres per inmate. The Programme’s annual targets were to bring sixty per cent of remand centres into compliance with the Russian sanitary norm by 2011 and all of them by 2016. However, less than one per cent of remand centres were expected to be compatible with the international standard of seven square metres per inmate by 2011 and only 11.4 per cent by 2016.\n189: Notwithstanding a perceptible trend towards an improvement in material conditions of detention and a reduction in the number of prisoners awaiting trial, the urgency of the problem of overcrowding has not abated in recent years. The Court’s findings in the instant case and the continuing influx of new applications illustrate the gravity of the situation in some remand centres where inmates still do not have at their disposal an individual sleeping place, as was the case for Mr Ananyev, and highlight the absence of effective domestic remedies for either putting an end to an ongoing violation or obtaining compensation for a period of detention that has already ended. It is a reason for grave concern for the Court that the violations identified in the present judgment occurred more than five years after the Kalashnikov judgment in which the problem of overcrowding had been identified for the first time, notwithstanding the respondent Government’s obligation under Article 46 to adopt, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, the necessary remedial and preventive measures, both at individual and general levels (compare Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 134).\n190: Taking into account the recurrent and persistent nature of the problem, the large number of people it has affected or is capable of affecting, and the urgent need to grant them speedy and appropriate redress at the domestic level, the Court considers it appropriate to apply the pilot-judgment procedure in the present case (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 130, and Finger v. , no. 37346/05, § 128, 10 May 2011). As it has emphasised above, the mere repetition of the Court’s findings in similar individual cases would not be the best way to achieve the Convention’s purpose. The Court thus feels compelled to address the underlying structural problems in greater depth, to examine the source of those problems and to provide further assistance to the respondent State in finding the appropriate solutions and to the Committee of Ministers in supervising the execution of the judgments (see Resolution Res(2004)3 of the Committee of Ministers on judgments revealing an underlying systemic problem, and the Declarations adopted by the High Contracting Parties at the Interlaken and Izmir conferences).\n191: The Court acknowledges that the recurrent violations of Article 3 resulting from inadequate conditions of detention in some Russian remand centres constitute an issue of considerable magnitude and complexity. It is not the product of a defective legal provision or regulation or a particular lacuna in Russian law. Rather, it is a multifaceted problem owing its existence to a large number of negative factors, both legal and logistical in nature. Some of them – such as the insufficient number of remand prisons, their antiquity and poor state of repair, misallocation of resources, and a lack of transparency in prison management – may be traced back to the penitentiary system, whereas others – such as the excessive and often unjustified recourse to detention on remand, rather than alternative preventive measures, or a lack of efficient remedies to ensure that the conditions comply with the Russian legislation – have originated elsewhere.\n192: It is undisputable that the situation in Russian remand centres as described above still requires comprehensive general measures at national level, measures which must take into consideration a large number of individuals who are currently affected by it. The Court welcomes the efforts that have been deployed so far by the Russian authorities with a view to bringing the conditions of detention in remand centres into line with the domestic and international standards. In the period from 2002 to 2006, a federal programme for reforming prisons permitted renovation and reconstruction of a number of remand centres and resulted in a tangible increase in the number of places and floor space per inmate. It was followed by a still more ambitious programme, approved by a Government decision of 5 September 2006 for a period from 2007 to 2016, which provides in particular for the construction of more than twenty new remand centres providing remand prisoners with seven square metres of personal space. Most importantly, one of the programme’s objectives is to ensure that, by the year 2016, the accommodation in all remand prisons should meet the Russian legal requirement of four square metres per person.\n193: The Court, however, notes with regret that the other measures for improvement of the material conditions of detention that can be implemented in the short term and at little extra cost – such as for instance shielding the toilets located inside the cell with curtains or partitions, removal of thick netting on cell windows blocking access to natural light and a reasonable increase in the frequency of showers – have not yet been implemented. The Court also observes that the adoption of such measures has been considered by the Committee of Ministers in close co-operation with the Russian authorities (see the Interim Resolutions cited in paragraphs 59 and 60 above). The Committee’s Resolutions demonstrate that some progress has been achieved and that further action is being considered and taken to tackle the problem.\n194: The Court, like the Committee of Ministers, supports the Russian authorities’ position that there should be an integrated approach to finding solutions to the problem of overcrowding in remand prisons, including in particular changes to the legal framework, practices and attitudes (see the Committee’s Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above). Having examined a variety of the measures already adopted and still being taken for the improvement of conditions of pre-trial detention in , the Court notes that this process raises a number of complex legal and practical issues which go, in principle, beyond the Court’s judicial function. It is not the Court’s task to advise the respondent Government about such a complex reform process, let alone recommend a particular way of organising its penal and penitentiary system. While the pilot-judgment procedure has been instrumental in helping Contracting States to comply with their obligations under the Convention, the Court does not have the capacity, nor is it appropriate to its function as an international court, to involve itself in reforms of that type in parallel with the Committee of Ministers or to order a specific general measure to be adopted in that process by the respondent State. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the measures that need to be adopted by Russia to ensure adequate conditions of pre-trial detention in accordance with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Finger, cited above, § 115; Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 136 and 137; and Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v. Ukraine, no. 40450/04, §§ 90-92, ECHR 2009-... (extracts)).\n195: The above considerations do not prevent the Court, however, from indicating the existence of a general issue or voicing a particular concern that warrant the respondent State’s in-depth consideration in the light of its findings in individual cases. Such indications from the Court would be all the more useful and appropriate as they contribute to a better identification of complex structural problems underlying the violations and to the establishment of appropriate solutions to such problems.\n196: Thus, the Court considers it important for the purposes of the present judgment to highlight two such issues which need inevitably to be addressed by the Russian authorities in their ongoing struggle against persistent overcrowding of remand centres. The first issue concerns the close affinity between the problem of overcrowding, which falls to be considered under Article 3 of the Convention, and an excessive length of pre-trial detention, which has been found by the Court to violate another provision of the Convention, namely Article 5, in an equally significant number of Russian cases. The second issue, which is closely linked to the first, concerns possible additional ways of combating the overcrowding through provisional arrangements and safeguards for the admission of prisoners in excess of the prison capacity.\n197: It has been the constant and common position of all Council of Europe bodies that a reduction in the number of remand prisoners would be the most appropriate solution to the problem of overcrowding. The Court has reiterated in many of its judgments that, in view of both the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of liberty, remand in custody must be the exception rather than the norm and only a measure of last resort (see, among many others, McKay v. the  [GC], no. 543/03, § 41, ECHR 2006X). The Committee for the Prevention of Torture considered that in the context of high incarceration rates, such as those persisting in Russia, “throwing increasing amounts of money at the prison estate will not offer a solution” (see paragraph 28 of the 11th General Report, CPT/Inf(2001)16), and has advocated active review of pre-trial custody policy. As recently as in 2010 the Committee of Ministers indicated that “the creation of new places of detention cannot in itself provide a lasting solution to the problem of prison overcrowding and that this measure should be closely supported by others aimed at reducing the overall number of remand prisoners” (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, and also point I(2) of the Appendix to Recommendation R(99)22, cited in paragraph 57 above).\n198: The statistical information from the Russian judicial system demonstrates a substantial reduction in the number of initial applications for a detention order, down approximately thirty-four per cent in 2010 as compared to 2007 (see paragraph 53 above). The number of applications for an extension order also diminished but in a much less perceptible manner, only by some eight per cent in the same four-year period. A decreasing number of applications for initial detention orders may be interpreted as a consequence of the recent steps towards decriminalising certain non-violent offences and also as an indication of a more reserved approach on the part of investigative authorities to using custody as a preventive measure at the pre-trial stage. Even though the number of requests by the prosecutors has decreased in relative terms, the absolute number still appears to be much too high.\n199: What seems to be a reason for concern is that in the same time period the percentage of applications for a detention order granted by courts has remained at a constant and inordinately high level and has never varied despite a decreasing global number of such applications. Indeed, in the years 2007 to 2010 the Russian courts have ordered placement in custody in more than ninety per cent of cases in which this measure was sought by the investigative authorities, and approved applications for a further extension order in approximately ninety-eight per cent of cases. In practical terms, this meant that the prosecutor’s request for a custodial measure was rejected only in respect of one in ten defendants and that only one out of fifty incarcerated defendants was set free before the opening day of the trial. In the second half of the year 2008, bail was used in 407 cases; in the first half of 2009, their number grew to 599 (see point II (4) of Appendix II to Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above), which still represented less than one per cent of the cases in which the suspect was remanded in custody. The statistics for the year 2010 did not show any visible change in the judicial practice and the percentage of rejected applications for detention or extension orders increased by less than 0.2 per cent, notwithstanding the fact that on 22 October 2009 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation adopted a special ruling (see paragraph 52 above) by which it reminded the courts that detention on remand should only be ordered if other preventive measures could not be applied.\n200: The Court, for its part, has already identified a malfunctioning of the Russian judicial system on account of excessively lengthy detention on remand without proper justification. Starting with the Kalashnikov judgment in 2002, the Court has to date found a violation of the obligation to guarantee a trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, in more than eighty cases against Russia where the domestic courts extended an applicant’s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and employing the same stereotyped formulae, without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see, among many other authorities, Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, §§ 99 et seq., 1 March 2007; Mamedova, cited above, §§ 72 et seq.; Dolgova v. Russia, no. 11886/05, §§ 38 et seq., 2 March 2006; Khudoyorov, cited above, §§ 172 et seq.; Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, §§ 63 et seq., 7 April 2005; Panchenko v. Russia, no. 45100/98, §§ 91 et seq., 8 February 2005; and Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, §§ 56 et seq., ECHR 2003-IX (extracts)). The Court noted in particular that “the lack of reasoning was not an accidental or short-term omission but rather a customary way of dealing with applications for release” (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 108, ECHR 2006-... (extracts)).\n201: Unjustified and excessive recourse to custodial measures at the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings has also been pinpointed by the Committee of Ministers as a structural problem in . Its existence has been confirmed by the continuous flow of new similar applications to the Court and by the data available at national level and it has been closely linked with the problem of overcrowding in pre-trial detention centres (see points 3 and 4 of the Memorandum “Detention on remand in the Russian Federation: Measures required to comply with the European Court’s judgments” prepared by the Department of the Execution of Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights CM/InfDH(2007)4 of 12 February 2007, and Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above). The Committee of Ministers noted the repeated statements by the Russian President and high-ranking State officials, including the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Justice, to the effect that up to thirty per cent of individuals held in custody should not have been deprived of their liberty, having been suspected or accused of offences of low or medium gravity, and welcomed the unambiguous commitment at the highest political level to change this unacceptable situation and to adopt urgent legislative and other measures to that effect (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above).\n202: The Court welcomes the steps that have already been taken by the Russian authorities to reduce the number of individuals remanded in custody at the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings. It reiterates that Russian prosecutors should be formally encouraged to decrease the number of applications for detention orders, except in the most serious cases involving violent offences. However, the above judicial statistics, read together with the findings of a violation of Article 5 § 3 in the Court’s recent judgments and the Committee of Ministers’ assessment, demonstrate that the successful prevention of overcrowding of remand centres is contingent on further consistent and long-term measures for achieving full compliance with the requirements of Article 5 § 3. In addition to the Committee of Ministers’ conclusions in its Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 and Recommendation Rec(2006)13 on the use of remand in custody, the conditions in which it takes place and the provision of safeguards against abuse, the Court strongly doubts that the existing trend to use deprivation of liberty as the preventive measure of predilection can be reversed unless the relevant provisions of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure have been amended to reflect expressly the requirements flowing from Article 5 of the Convention. As the Court has consistently reiterated, the first among these requirements is that the presumption should in all cases be in favour of release and that remand in custody should be an exceptional measure rather than the norm. Until conviction, the defendant must be presumed innocent and may be remanded in custody only if it has been convincingly established by reference to specific facts and evidence collected by the prosecution that (i) there is reasonable suspicion that he or she committed an offence, and (ii) there is a substantial risk of his or her absconding, reoffending, obstructing the course of justice or threatening public order, and (iii) these risks cannot be satisfactorily allayed through the use of bail or any other preventive measure not related to deprivation of liberty (see points II (6)-(9) of Recommendation Rec(2006)13, and, among other authorities, Bykov v.  [GC], no. 4378/02, §§ 61-64, ECHR 2009..., and Kudła, cited above, §§ 110 et seq.).\n203: Finally, any such amendment to the existing legislative framework should be accompanied by effective measures to implement the changes in judicial practice. The Court notes, as an interesting example, that some Contracting States responded to its judgments by redistributing judicial duties and appointing special judges to decide on the application of preventive measures and supervise the observance of human rights in criminal proceedings (see, in particular, Resolution CM/ResDH(2009)131 on the execution of the Court’s judgments in Lavents and Jurjevs against Latvia; see also Resolution ResDH(2003)50 on the execution of the Court’s judgment in Muller against France presenting the French Law on Presumption of Innocence of 15 June 2000, which introduced the function of juge des libertés et de la detention). Adequate in-service training of judges dealing with applications for detention orders is also indispensable, as was highlighted in the Committee of Ministers’ Recommendation (2004)4 of 12 May 2004 on the Convention and professional training.\n204: A realistic outlook on the situation as it obtains at the present time in Russian pre-trial detention centres demonstrates that a significant number of them are still suffering from overcrowding and other deviations from the standards of detention established in Russian legislation. Notwithstanding a marked improvement in material conditions over recent years and the additional efforts that have already been planned and budgeted for, substandard conditions of detention are likely to persist for several more years (see, for instance, the data in Appendix II to Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 and in the Federal Programme for Development of the Penitentiary, both cited above). This situation calls for the prompt introduction of additional legal safeguards that would be capable of preventing or at least alleviating the overcrowding in those prisons where it has remained, and ensuring effective respect for the rights of individuals who have been or will be detained there.\n205: The European Prison Rules require that the national law set specific minimum requirements in respect of the accommodation provided for prisoners, with particular regard being had to the floor space, cubic content of air, lighting, heating and ventilation (Rules 18.1-18.3). It would appear therefore appropriate to establish the maximum capacity (numerus clausus) for each remand prison through the definition of space per inmate as a minimum of square and possibly cubic metres, which would at least be compatible with the current requirements of the Pre-trial Detention Act and would be periodically reviewed to reflect the evolving penitentiary standards. In addition, an operational capacity may be defined which is different from the maximum capacity and based on control, security and the proper operation of the regime, with a view to ensuring a smooth turnover of inmates and accommodating partial renovation work or other contingencies.\n206: In order to ensure better compliance with the rules set out in law, the powers and responsibility of the governors of remand centres need to be reviewed. At present, there does not appear to be any possibility for the governors not to accept detainees beyond the prison capacity. The situation could be improved by creating such a possibility in connection with the introduction of rules on maximum capacity, as described in the preceding paragraph, in order to ensure that the operational capacity of remand centres is not exceeded other than in strictly defined and exceptional circumstances.\n207: The law may, however, provide for special transitional arrangements which could apply pending an overall improvement of conditions of detention in the remand prison. By way of example, the Court would point to the legislative amendments that were introduced in the Polish Code of Execution of Sentences in the wake of the pilot judgment concerning the conditions of detention in Polish prisons (see paragraph 61 et seq. above). The crucial features of special transitional arrangements should be the following: (i) a short and defined duration; (ii) judicial supervision; and (iii) availability of compensation.\n208: Allowing only a short period in which to find a detention facility that meets the adequate conditions requirements should ensure that the endurance of inadequate conditions would not be long enough to entail a violation of Article 3. The duration of the transitional period in a specific case should be decided upon by a court by reference to concrete factual circumstances, but the law should set the maximum duration of such detention which should not be exceeded under any circumstances. The law should also exhaustively define the situations in which the court may order the detainee’s temporary placement in an overcrowded facility. It is finally important to establish some form of compensation for such temporary placement, whether it is monetary compensation, extended hours of outdoor exercise, increased access to out-of-cell recreational activities, or a combination of these.\n209: The Court further notes that it would be advisable if prosecutors and prison governors could use the additional time gained through transitional arrangements to examine the possibilities for freeing up places in the remand prison that offer adequate conditions of detention. Working in co-operation, they would be able to diligently identify the detainees whose authorised period of detention is about to expire or is no longer needed, and to make a proposal to the judicial or prosecutorial authorities for their immediate release. Such concerted action by the prison and prosecution authorities is an important element for easing the level of overcrowding and ensuring adequate material conditions.\n210: The Court further reiterates that the applicants in the present case were victims of a violation of Article 13 of the Convention on account of the absence of an effective domestic remedy for ventilating arguable claims of allegedly inadequate conditions of detention. The Court reached this conclusion following a careful examination of the situation obtaining in Russian law. The Court also noted the structural nature of this problem in the Russian legal system, finding that it does not currently allow the aggrieved individual either to put an end to an ongoing violation or to obtain adequate compensation for a period of detention that has already ended.\n211: In view of the time elapsed since its first judgments highlighting that problem, the Court considers that the Russian Federation’s obligations under the Convention compel it to set up the effective domestic remedies required by Article 13 without further delay. The need for such remedies is all the more pressing as large numbers of people affected by violations of a fundamental Convention right have no other choice but to seek relief through time-consuming international litigation before the Court. This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which is prominent in the Convention system (see Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 46113/99 et al., § 69, ECHR 2010...; Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev (dec.), nos. 27451/09 and 60650/09, § 40, 23 September 2010). Less than full application of the guarantees of Article 13 in this context would unacceptably weaken the effective functioning, on the national and international level, of the scheme of human rights protection set up by the Convention (see Finger, cited above, § 121, and McFarlane v.  [GC], no. 31333/06, § 112, ECHR 2010..., with further references). The Contracting States have consistently emphasised the need for effective domestic remedies, not least in the context of repetitive cases, which become vital for guaranteeing the long-term effectiveness of the Convention and containing the Court’s workload (see Recommendation Rec(2004)6 to member States on the improvement of domestic remedies, and the Declarations adopted by the High Contracting Parties at the Interlaken and Izmir conferences).\n212: The Court reiterates that it has expressly abstained from requiring the respondent State to take any specific general measure for the purpose of bringing the conditions of detention in remand centres into line with Article 3 of the Convention. While voicing its concerns and indicating possible ways to address the existing deficiencies, the Court has found that any substantive mandate in this area would go beyond its judicial function, given the nature of the issues involved. The situation is, however, not the same as regards the violation of Article 13 on account of the lack of effective domestic remedies in respect of the applicants’ complaints about inadequate conditions of detention. In accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, the Court’s findings under this provision require clear and specific changes in the domestic legal system that would allow all people in the applicants’ position to complain about alleged violations of Article 3 resulting from inadequate detention conditions and to obtain adequate and sufficient redress for such violations at domestic level.\n213: The Court has already highlighted the existing shortcomings in Russian law and set out the Convention principles which should guide the authorities in setting up effective domestic remedies as required by the Convention. It is recalled that the respondent State is free to choose the means to meet those requirements subject to supervision of the Committee of Ministers under Article 46 of the Convention. In order to assist the authorities in finding the appropriate solutions, the Court will give further consideration to that matter. It will do by addressing first the preventive remedies and then turning to the compensatory remedy.\n214: An important safeguard for the prevention of violations resulting from inadequate conditions of detention is an efficient system of detainees’ complaints to the domestic authorities (see Orchowski, cited above, § 154). To be efficient, the system must ensure a prompt and diligent handling of prisoners’ complaints, secure their effective participation in the examination of grievances, and provide a wide range of legal tools for the purpose of eradicating the identified breach of Convention requirements.\n215: Filing a complaint with an authority supervising detention facilities is normally a more reactive and speedy way of dealing with grievances than litigation before courts. The authority in question should have the mandate to monitor the violations of prisoners’ rights. The title of such authority or its place within the administrative structures is not crucial as long as it is independent from the penitentiary system’s bodies, such as for instance Independent Monitoring Boards in the United Kingdom (formerly Boards of Visitors) or the Complaints Commission (beklagcommissie) in the . In the Russian legal system, this mandate is entrusted to prosecutors’ offices that have independent standing and responsibility for overseeing compliance by the prison authorities with the Russian legislation.\n216: In addition to being independent, the supervising authority must have the power to investigate the complaints with the participation of the complainant and the right to render binding and enforceable decisions. As the Court has observed above, the Pre-trial Detention Act and Prosecutors Act have vested broad investigative powers with supervising prosecutors and instituted a requirement on the prison authorities to report to them on the enforcement of their decisions. However, a complaint to a prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy in so far as the process of its examination does not provide for participation of the detainee. The Court considers that, for the procedure before the supervising prosecutor to be compliant with such requirements, the complainant must at least be provided with an opportunity to comment on factual submissions by the prison governor produced at the prosecutor’s request, to put questions and to make additional submissions to the prosecutor. The treatment of the complaint does not have to be public or call for the institution of any kind of oral proceedings, but there should be a legal obligation on the prosecutor to issue a decision on the complaint within a reasonably short time-limit.\n217: Turning now to the possibility of complaining to a court of general jurisdiction about an infringement of rights or liberties under the provisions of Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“a Chapter 25 claim”), the Court notes that proceedings on a Chapter 25 claim are attended with appropriate safeguards of their adversarial nature and make provision for a fair trial and effective participation of the claimant. It also welcomes the ruling by the Plenary Supreme Court of 10 February 2009, which explicitly characterised complaints about inadequate conditions of detention as being actionable Chapter 25 claims. The Court has little doubt that this type of claim has the potential of becoming an effective domestic remedy, subject, however, to the following reservations.\n218: Under the Code of Civil Procedure, a justified Chapter 25 claim may result in a declaration of unlawfulness and a requirement to make good the violation found. There is no mention of the possibility of claiming, or being awarded, compensation in respect of the violation that has already occurred. It is likewise unclear whether a Chapter 25 claim may be combined with an ordinary claim for damages under Articles 151 and 1064 of the Civil Code and be examined in the same set of proceedings. If the joining of these claims is impossible as a matter of law or judicial practice, this would impose an excessive burden on the claimant, who would be required first to litigate over his or her substantive grievance and then to bring the declaration of unlawfulness back to the same court with a view to instituting a new set of proceedings for compensation. The Court considers that the Chapter 25 claim should provide for the possibility of granting compensation in respect of an infringement of the claimant’s right that has already occurred.\n219: Furthermore, enforcement of a Chapter 25 judgment may be frustrated by legal and practical impediments. The Code of Civil Procedure does not specify the kind of remedial action a court may order and, as the Court has observed above, there is no case-law that could give indications as to the prevailing judicial practice. It is therefore impossible to ascertain whether a Chapter 25 judgment would be limited to a general statement that the established violation be removed or could also order specific measures that would be needed to combat overcrowding and other forms of ill-treatment, affecting not just the claimant but large segments of the prison population. Taking into account the pervasive and structural nature of the problem of overcrowding, consideration should be given to equipping the Russian courts with appropriate legal tools allowing them to consider the problem underlying an individual complaint and effectively deal with situations of massive and concurrent violations of prisoners’ rights resulting from inadequate detention conditions in a given remand facility.\n220: Finally, an important issue arises with regard to enforcement of a Chapter 25 court order and a lack of appropriate sanctions for non-enforcement. The recently enacted Compensation Act of 30 April 2010 is not applicable to Chapter 25 court orders as it only allows the creditor to claim monetary compensation in connection with the belated enforcement of a judgment debt against the State budgets (see Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev (dec.), cited above). Furthermore, Chapter 25 orders do not appear to be subject to mandatory enforcement by the court bailiffs. It follows that such a judicial order may remain without effect in practice. Admittedly, a State official who persistently sabotages enforcement of a judicial decision may be held criminally liable under Article 315 of the Criminal Code; however, the Court has not yet seen evidence of an established practice of instituting criminal proceedings against defaulting officials (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 104). It is therefore important to introduce measures which ensure that the requirement to report back to the court is respected.\n221: In all cases where a violation of Article 3 has already occurred, the Court considers that the State must be prepared to acknowledge the violation and make readily available some form of compensation to the aggrieved individual. The introduction of the preventive remedy alone would clearly not be sufficient because a remedy designed to prevent the overcrowding and other violations of Article 3 from occurring would not be adequate to redress a situation in which the individual has already endured for some time inhuman or degrading treatment. The respondent Government must therefore put in place a remedy which can provide redress for the violations that have already occurred. The Court would add that the introduction of an effective compensatory remedy would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdictions (see Demopoulos and Others (dec.), cited above, § 69, and also, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 188, ECHR 2006V).\n222: A mitigation of sentence may under certain conditions be a form of compensation afforded to defendants in connection with violations of the Convention that occurred in the criminal proceedings against them. The Court has previously accepted that in cases concerning the failure to observe the reasonable-time requirement guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the national authorities can afford adequate redress in particular by reducing the applicant’s sentence in an express and measurable manner (see Finger, cited above, § 128; Morby v. Luxembourg (dec.), no. 27156/02, 13 November 2003; Beck v. , no. 26390/95, §§ 27-28, 26 June 2001, and Laurens v. Netherlands, no. 32366/96, Commission decision of 1 July 1998). In the Court’s view, such a mitigation of the sentence is also capable of affording adequate redress for a violation of Article 5 § 3 in cases in which the national authorities had failed to process the case of an applicant held in pre-trial detention with special diligence (see Dzelili v. , no. 65745/01, § 83, 10 November 2005).\n223: The Court has not yet had an opportunity to decide on a case in which the applicant’s sentence has been mitigated in redress for a prior violation of Article 3 of the Convention. It notes that, according to the official bulletin of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, a draft amendment of the sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code, introduced and prepared for first reading, provides for an increased crediting of the period spent in pre-trial detention towards the sentence (Draft Law no. 73983-5 amending Article 72 of the Criminal Code). The proposal envisages that the time in pre-trial detention would be multiplied by certain standard reduction coefficients and the resulting period deducted from the duration of the custodial sentence. Whereas it is not for the Court to express an opinion on such an legislative issue, it considers it relevant to reiterate in this connection the requirements of an effective remedy, set out in paragraph 94 above, which may be useful for the Russian authorities in their implementation of the present judgment irrespective of the outcome of the above legislative amendment.\n224: First, a compensatory remedy in the form of a mitigation of sentence will necessarily be of a limited remit, for it will be accessible only to the persons convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of a certain duration. It does nothing to accommodate the rights of persons who have been acquitted or convicted but given a sentence shorter than the time they had already spent in pre-trial detention adjusted by the applicable coefficient.\n225: Second, the courts must acknowledge the violation of Article 3 in a sufficiently clear way and afford redress by reducing the sentence in an express and measurable manner. Without a specific explanation in the domestic courts’ judgments as to the extent to which the finding and acknowledgement of a violation of Article 3 entailed a reduction of the sentence, the mitigation of the sentence would not deprive, on its own, the aggrieved individual of his status as a victim of the violation (see Dzelili, cited above, § 85). This measurability requirement presupposes the legal possibility for an individualised assessment of the impact of the violation on the Convention rights and of the specific redress that should be afforded to the aggrieved individual. An automatic mitigation operated by means of standard reduction coefficients is unlikely to be compatible with individualised assessment. Besides, it should be taken into account that an automatic reduction of sentence for convicted criminals on account of their previous stay in substandard detention facilities may adversely affect the public interest of criminal punishment (see Dimitrov and Hamanov v. , nos. 48059/06 and 2708/09, § 129, 10 May 2011).\n226: Finally, it is also clear that while an automatic mitigation of sentence on account of inhuman conditions of detention may be considered as a part of a wide array of general measures to be taken, it will not provide on its own a definitive solution to the existing problem of deficient remedies nor contribute, to a decisive extent, to eradication of genuine causes of overcrowding, namely the excessive use of custodial measures at the pre-trial stage and poor material conditions of detention.\n227: As regards the possibility of obtaining monetary compensation for a violation of Article 3, in the light of the Court’s conclusions set out in paragraphs 113-118 above, it appears unlikely that an effective compensatory remedy can become operational without changing the provisions of the domestic legislation on certain crucial points (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 138). For the sake of clarity and given the importance of the matter, the Court finds it appropriate to provide guidance to the Government, in order to assist them in the performance of their duty under Article 46 § 1 of the Convention.\n228: Monetary compensation should be accessible to anyone who has been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention and who has made an application to that effect. The Court emphasises that the burden of proof imposed on the claimant in compensation proceedings should not be excessive. He or she may be required to show a prima facie case of ill-treatment and produce such evidence as is readily accessible to him or her, such as a detailed description of conditions of detention, statements from witnesses or replies from supervisory bodies. It would then fall to the authorities to refute the allegations of ill-treatment by means of documentary evidence capable of demonstrating that the conditions of the claimant’s detention were not in breach of Article 3. The procedural rules governing the examination of such a claim must conform to the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention, including that it be heard within a reasonable time, and the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their claim is justified (see Finger, cited above, § 125).\n229: The finding of an incompatibility of the conditions of detention with the requirements of Article 3, on the basis of the criteria outlined in paragraphs 143-158 above, is of a factual nature and creates a strong legal presumption that such conditions have occasioned non-pecuniary damage to the aggrieved individual. The domestic law on compensation must reflect the existence of this presumption rather than, as it does now, make the award of compensation conditional on the claimant’s ability to prove the fault of specific officials or bodies and the unlawfulness of their actions. As the Court has previously found, substandard material conditions are not necessarily due to failings of prison governors or other officials but may be the product of structural malfunctioning of the domestic framework of detention on remand, whereas overcrowding may result from deficiencies originating outside the penitentiary system, for instance in courts or prosecutorial offices. It is also recalled in this connection that, even in a situation where every aspect of the conditions of detention complies with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect may be such as to constitute inhuman treatment (see paragraph 115 above). It must therefore be made clear that neither a high crime rate, nor a lack of resources, nor other structural problems may be regarded as circumstances excluding or attenuating the domestic authorities’ liability for non-pecuniary damage incurred through inhuman or degrading conditions of detention. As the Court repeatedly stressed, it is incumbent on the Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way that it ensures respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of any financial or logistical difficulties (see, among others, Yevgeniy Alekseyenko, § 87, and Mamedova, § 63, both cited above).\n230: The level of compensation awarded for non-pecuniary damage must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases. The principles outlined by the Court in paragraph 172 above may serve as guidance for the Russian authorities in determining the amount of compensation. The right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is so fundamental and central to the system of the protection of human rights that the domestic authority or court dealing with the matter will have to provide exceptionally compelling and serious reasons to justify their decision to award lower or no compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage (compare Finger, cited above, § 130).\n231: The Court would finally emphasise that, to be truly effective and compliant with the principle of subsidiarity, a compensatory remedy needs to operate retrospectively and provide redress in respect of the violations of Article 3 which predated its introduction, both in situations where the detention has already ended with the detainee’s release or transfer to a different detention regime and in situations where the detainee is still held in the conditions that fall short of the requirements of Article 3 (compare Finger, cited above, § 131).\n232: The Court decided to apply the pilot-judgment procedure in the present case, referring notably to the large number of people affected and the urgent need to grant them speedy and appropriate redress at domestic level. It is therefore convinced that the purpose of the present judgment can only be achieved if the required changes take effect in the Russian legal system without undue delay. It is not the Court’s task to specify what would be the most appropriate way to set up the necessary remedies. The State may either amend the existing range of legal remedies or add new remedies to secure genuinely effective redress for the violation of the Convention rights concerned in the light of the Court’s findings and recommendations set out above. It is also for the State to ensure, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, that such combination of remedies respects both in theory and in practice the requirements of the Convention as set out in this judgment (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 140).\n233: Whatever the approach chosen by the authorities, the creation of effective domestic remedies for complaints concerning inadequate conditions of detention may require, in the Court’s preliminary assessment, a longer period of time than that which was required for the setting-up of a compensatory remedy in respect of the non-enforcement of domestic judicial decisions in response to the Burdov pilot judgment (see Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev (dec.), cited above, § 38). The Court is convinced that a reasonable time-limit must be fixed for the adoption of the measures, given the importance and urgency of the matter and the fundamental nature of the right which is at stake. Nonetheless, it does not find it appropriate’ to indicate a specific time frame for the introduction of a combination of preventive and compensatory remedies in respect of alleged violations of Article 3, involving as it does the preparation of draft laws, amendments and regulations, then their enactment and implementation, together with the provision of appropriate training for the State officials concerned. The Committee of Ministers is better equipped for that kind of task.\n234: In view of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the Russian Government must produce, in co-operation with the Committee of Ministers, within six months from the date on which this judgment becomes final, a binding time frame in which to make available preventive and compensatory remedies in respect of alleged violations of Article 3 of the Convention on account of inhuman and degrading conditions of detention.\n235: The Court reiterates that one of the aims of the pilot-judgment procedure is to allow the speediest possible redress to be granted at the domestic level to the large numbers of people suffering from the structural problem identified in the pilot judgment (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 142). Rule 61 § 6 of the Rules of Court provides for the possibility of adjourning the examination of all similar applications pending the implementation of the remedial measures by the respondent State. The Court would emphasise that adjournment is a possibility rather than an obligation, as clearly shown by the inclusion of the words “as appropriate” in the text of Rule 61 § 6 and the variety of approaches used in the previous pilot-case judgments (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 143-146, where the adjournment concerned only the applications lodged after the delivery of the pilot judgment, or Rumpf, cited above, § 75, where an adjournment was not considered to be necessary).\n236: Having regard to the fundamental nature of the right protected by Article 3 of the Convention and the importance and urgency of complaints about inhuman or degrading treatment, the Court does not consider it appropriate to adjourn the examination of similar cases. On the contrary, the Court observes that continuing to process all conditions-of-detention cases in a diligent manner will remind the respondent State on a regular basis of its obligations under the Convention and in particular those resulting from this judgment (see Rumpf, loc. cit.).\n237: Furthermore, as regards the applications that were lodged before the delivery of this judgment, the Court considers that it would be unfair if the applicants in such cases who had already suffered through periods of detention in allegedly inhuman or degrading conditions and, in the absence of an effective domestic remedy, sought relief in this Court, were compelled yet again to resubmit their grievances to the domestic authorities, be it on the grounds of a new remedy or otherwise (compare Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 144, and Łatak, cited above, § 85).\n238: The Court is convinced, however, that adjudication of hundreds pending cases of this kind will be a time-consuming process which can only be accelerated by the respondent State’s efficient response to the present judgment, including the resolution of the well-founded cases at the domestic level by means of friendly settlements or unilateral remedial offers. An accelerated settlement of the individual cases at the domestic level is not only required because of the gravity of the applicants’ allegations under Article 3, a provision of fundamental importance in the Convention system. The need for such a settlement is also dictated by the principle of subsidiarity: once the Court has clarified the obligations of the respondent State under the Convention, it is in principle for the latter to take the necessary remedial measures, so that the Court does not have to reiterate its finding of a violation in a long series of comparable cases.\n239: The Court therefore considers that the respondent State must grant adequate and sufficient redress to all victims of inhuman or degrading conditions of detention in Russian remand prisons (SIZOs) who lodged their applications with the Court before the delivery of this judgment. Such redress will have to be made available within twelve months from the date on which this judgment become final or from the date on which the application will have been communicated to the Government under Rule 54 § 2 (b) of the Rules of Court, whichever comes later. In the Court’s view, such redress may notably be achieved through ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 145). It is recalled that the compatibility of the conditions of detention with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention will be assessed by reference to the criteria defined in this judgment (see paragraphs 143-158 above) and that the amounts of compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage will be determined in the light of the Court’s case-law and the principles outlined in paragraph 172 above.\n240: The Court will examine the information provided by the Government regarding the redress offered in each particular case and accordingly decide whether the circumstances justify its continued examination."

Such close proximity and exposure was not only objectionable from a hygiene perspective but also deprived a detainee using the toilet of any privacy because he remained at all times in full view of other inmates sitting on the bunks and also of warders looking through the peephole (see, among other authorities, Aleksandr Makarov, § 97, Trepashkin, § 94, Grishin, § 94, and Kalashnikov, § 99, all cited above). In one case the Court considered that the lack of privacy resulting from the openness of the toilet area must have taken a particularly heavy toll on the applicant, who was undergoing treatment for haemorrhoids and had to apply his medication in front of his cellmates and warders (see Moiseyev, cited above, § 124).",
            "001-108465\n156: The Court considers, as does the Committee for the Prevention of Torture, that access to properly equipped and hygienic sanitary facilities is of paramount importance for maintaining the inmates’ sense of personal dignity (see paragraph 49 of the 2nd General Report, cited in paragraph 56 above). Not only are hygiene and cleanliness integral parts of the respect that individuals owe to their bodies and to their neighbours with whom they share premises for long periods of time, they also constitute a condition and at the same time a necessity for the conservation of health. A truly humane environment is not possible without ready access to toilet facilities or the possibility of keeping one’s body clean (see point 15 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and point 19.4 of the European Prison Rules, cited in paragraphs 55 and 58 above, respectively).",
            "001-108465\n165: As regards sanitary and hygiene conditions, both the dining table and the lavatory pan were located inside the applicants’ cells, sometimes as close to each other as one or one and a half metres. A partition, approximately one to one a half metres in height, separated the toilet on one side; the prison regulations did not allow the toilet to be completely shielded from view by means of a door or a curtain. Cold running water was normally available in cells and detainees had access to showers once every seven to ten days.",
            "001-108465\n160: The Court will now proceed to assess, in the light of the above-mentioned general principles and requirements, whether or not the facts, as established above, disclosed a violation of Article 3 in relation to the applicants.",
            "001-108465\n238: The Court is convinced, however, that adjudication of hundreds pending cases of this kind will be a time-consuming process which can only be accelerated by the respondent State’s efficient response to the present judgment, including the resolution of the well-founded cases at the domestic level by means of friendly settlements or unilateral remedial offers. An accelerated settlement of the individual cases at the domestic level is not only required because of the gravity of the applicants’ allegations under Article 3, a provision of fundamental importance in the Convention system. The need for such a settlement is also dictated by the principle of subsidiarity: once the Court has clarified the obligations of the respondent State under the Convention, it is in principle for the latter to take the necessary remedial measures, so that the Court does not have to reiterate its finding of a violation in a long series of comparable cases.",
            "001-108465\n159: Finally, the necessary sanitary precautions should include measures against infestation with rodents, fleas, lice, bedbugs and other vermin. Such measures comprise sufficient and adequate disinfection facilities, provision of detergent products, and regular fumigation and checkups of the cells and in particular bed linen, mattresses and the areas used for keeping food. This is an indispensable element for the prevention of skin diseases, such as scabies, which appear to have been a common occurrence in Russian remand prisons (see Kozhokar, § 87, Shcherbakov, § 14, Buzhinayev, § 17, Grigoryevskikh, § 25, Belashev, §§ 34-35, Novoselov, § 23, and Kalashnikov, §§ 18 and 29, all cited above).",
            "001-108465\n162: The applicant Mr Bashirov in the  prison was held in conditions that provided no more than two square metres of floor surface per inmate (see paragraph 138 above). The situation of the applicant Mr Ananyev was even worse: not only was the personal space per detainee marginally greater than one square metre, but also the number of detainees per cell significantly exceeded the number of sleeping places (see paragraph 133 above).",
            "001-108465\n222: A mitigation of sentence may under certain conditions be a form of compensation afforded to defendants in connection with violations of the Convention that occurred in the criminal proceedings against them. The Court has previously accepted that in cases concerning the failure to observe the reasonable-time requirement guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the national authorities can afford adequate redress in particular by reducing the applicant’s sentence in an express and measurable manner (see Finger, cited above, § 128; Morby v. Luxembourg (dec.), no. 27156/02, 13 November 2003; Beck v. , no. 26390/95, §§ 27-28, 26 June 2001, and Laurens v. Netherlands, no. 32366/96, Commission decision of 1 July 1998). In the Court’s view, such a mitigation of the sentence is also capable of affording adequate redress for a violation of Article 5 § 3 in cases in which the national authorities had failed to process the case of an applicant held in pre-trial detention with special diligence (see Dzelili v. , no. 65745/01, § 83, 10 November 2005)."

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe upon the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings. These principles particularly hold true when using witness statements obtained during police inquiry and judicial investigation at a hearing. In making this assessment, the Court looks at the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victims in proper prosecution and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses.",

Valid citation formats: [001-108072] or [001-108072, 001-112280, 001-159566]. \n\n001-108072\n26: Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed. That was the case here. That public interest must not be allowed to override the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial. Like the court in Sellick [see paragraph 48 below] we do not consider that the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights requires the conclusion that in such circumstances the trial will be unfair. The provision in Article 6 § 3 (d) that a person charged shall be able to [have] the witnesses against him examined is one specific aspect of a fair trial: but if the opportunity is not provided, the question is ‘whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way the evidence was taken, were fair’ – Doorson, paragraph 19 [see paragraph 58 below]. This was not a case where the witness had absented himself, whether through fear or otherwise, or had required anonymity, or had exercised a right to keep silent. The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.”\n\n001-112280\n42: Furthermore, as concerns the fact that the Regional Court heard the investigating judge who gave an account of the witnesses’ pre-trial statements of 8 December 2003, the Court reiterates that the use in evidence of statements obtained at the investigative stage is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 3 (d) and 1 of Article 6, provided the defendant has been given an adequate opportunity to challenge the statements, either when made or at a later stage (see, among other authorities, Isgrò v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, § 34, Series A no. 194A; Lucà, cited above, § 40 and Gossa v. , no. 47986/99, § 54, 9 January 2007). This implies that the use made of evidence admitted by the trial court must comply with the rights of the defence, in particular, where the accused has not had an opportunity at any stage in the earlier proceedings to question the persons whose statements are introduced into the trial (see, mutatis mutandis, Unterpertinger, cited above, § 31) and where they form the sole or decisive evidence for a conviction or related decision by the trial court (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 119). The Court has held in this context that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may be restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (the so-called “sole or decisive rule”; ibid.).\n\n001-159566\n105: However, the use as evidence of statements obtained at the stage of a police inquiry and judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d), provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him – either when that witness is making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 118, with further references; see also A.G. v.

                "CASE OF IVANOVA AND CHERKEZOV v. BULGARIA; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 46577/15) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Bulgarian nationals, Ms Mavruda Dimitrova Ivanova and Mr Ivan Yankov Cherkezov (“the applicants”), on 15 September 2015.\n2: The applicants were represented by Ms A. Kachaunova, a lawyer practising in Sofia and working with the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee (“the BHC”). The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice.\n3: The applicants alleged that the enforcement of an order for the demolition of the house in which they live would be in breach of their right to respect for their home, and that they did not have an effective domestic remedy in that respect. The first applicant in addition alleged that the demolition would disproportionately interfere with her possessions.\n4: On 8 October 2015 the Court decided to give priority to the application and to give the Government notice of it.\n5: The applicants were born in 1959 and 1947 respectively and live in the village of Sinemorets, on the southern Black Sea coast.\n6: The two of them have lived as a family since 1989. At that time, they resided in the town of Burgas, where the first applicant owned a flat, which in 2013 she donated to her daughter, who had lived in it with her family for a number of years.\n7: The first applicant’s father and mother owned a plot of 625 square metres in Sinemorets. Following the death of the first applicant’s father in 1986 and ensuing division-of-property proceedings between his surviving wife and seven children, the first applicant’s mother was allotted 250 out of the 625 shares in the plot. In 1999 she transferred those shares, together with the nine sixteenths of the plot to which she was otherwise entitled as a heir of her late husband, to the first applicant. Combining the shares that she obtained as a result of this transfer and the one sixteenth of the plot that she had inherited from her father, the first applicant became the owner of 484.43 shares, or 75%, of the plot. On the plot, there existed a dilapidated one-storey cabin.\n8: In 2004 the second applicant, who had been employed as a driver, suffered a myocardial infraction and was no longer able to work. In 2005 he was recognised as a disabled person and has since then been in receipt of a disability pension. At about that time, the two applicants moved from Burgas to Sinemorets, allegedly because they were no longer able to afford living in Burgas. They submitted that they put all their savings into the reconstruction of the cabin, converting it into a solid one-storey brick house. They did not apply for a building permit. The reconstruction took place in 2004-05. Since that time, the two applicants have lived in that house. In 2006 two of the other co-owners of the plot formally notified the first applicant that they did not agree with the reconstruction. According to the Government, there was evidence that the construction had not been finalised before 2009.\n9: In 2006 the other ten heirs of the first applicant’s father and mother brought a claim against the first applicant, seeking a judicial declaration that they were the owners of 140.57 of the 625 shares of the plot and of the house built on it. The Tsarevo District Court dismissed the claim. On an appeal by the claimants, on 7 June 2009 the Burgas Regional Court quashed that judgment and made a declaration in the terms sought by the claimants, finding that they were the owners of 140.57 out of the total of 625 shares of the plot and the house built in the place of the old cabin. It also held that the first applicant was the owner of the remaining 484.43 shares of the plot and the house. The first applicant attempted to appeal on points of law, but in a decision of 22 June 2009 (опр. № 566 от 22.06.2009 г. по гр. д. № 1974/2009 г., ВКС, I г. о.), the Supreme Court of Cassation refused to admit the appeal for examination. In so doing, it held, inter alia, that by including the house in the declaration, the lower court had not erred because it was settled case-law that illegal buildings could be the objects of the right to property.\n10: For most of the year, the first applicant is unemployed. Her only source of income comes from servicing vacation houses in Sinemorets during the late spring and summer. The second applicant inherited shares of several plots of land in another village, which he sold for a total of 1,200 Bulgarian levs (614 euros) in 2012-14. The applicants used the money to buy a second-hand car.\n11: In September 2011, prompted by some of the other co-owners of the plot, municipal officers inspected the house and found that it had been constructed illegally. They notified their findings to the first applicant in October 20 In July 2012 the municipality brought the matter to the attention of the regional office of the National Building Control Directorate. In October 2012 that office advised the first applicant that it had opened proceedings for the demolition of the house. In November 2012 officers of the Directorate inspected it and likewise found that it was illegal as it had been constructed without a building permit.\n12: On 30 September 2013 the head of the regional office of the Directorate noted that the house had been constructed in 2004-05 without a building permit, in breach of section 148(1) of the Territorial Organisation Act 2001, and was as such subject to demolition under section 225(2)(2) of that Act (see paragraphs 25 and 26 below). The first applicant had not put forward any arguments or evidence to show otherwise. The house was therefore to be demolished. Once the decision had become final, the first applicant was to be invited to comply with it voluntarily. If she failed to do so in good time, the authorities would enforce it at her expense.\n13: The first applicant sought judicial review of that decision.\n14: On 10 December 2014 the Burgas Administrative Court dismissed the claim. It held that the decision was lawful. The evidence clearly showed that the applicants had constructed the house in 2004-05 without obtaining a building permit, which under section 225(2)(2) of the 2001 Act (see paragraph 26 below) was grounds for its demolition. The house could not be exempted from demolition under paragraph 16 of the transitional provisions of the 2001 Act or paragraph 127 of the transitional and concluding provisions of a 2012 Act for the amendment of the 2001 Act (see paragraphs 28 and 29 below).\n15: The first applicant appealed. She submitted, inter alia, that the house was her only home and that its demolition would cause her considerable difficulties as she would be unable to secure another place to live.\n16: In a final judgment of 17 March 2015 (реш. № 2900 от 17.03.2015 г. по адм. д. № 1381/2015 г., ВАС, II о.), the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court’s judgment. It agreed that the house was illegal as it had been constructed without a building permit, that it was as such subject to demolition, and that, having been constructed in 2004-05, it could not be legalised under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act or the 2012 Act.\n17: On 15 April 2015 the regional office of the National Building Control Directorate invited the first applicant to comply with the demolition order within fourteen days of receiving notice to do so, and advised her that failure to do so would prompt it to enforce the order at her expense.\n18: As the first applicant did not do so, on 6 August 2015 that office made a call for tenders from private companies willing to carry out the demolition; the deadline for submitting such offers was 15 September 2015.\n19: On 18 August 2015 the Burgas Municipal Ombudsman urged the Minister of Regional Development to halt the demolition on the basis that, although formally lawful, it would have a disproportionate impact on the applicants. In response, on 25 September 2015 the Directorate’s regional office reiterated its intention to proceed with the demolition.\n20: After the Government were given notice of the application (see paragraph 4 above), on 15 October 2015 the Directorate’s regional office asked the municipal authorities to explore whether, if necessary, they could provide alternative accommodation for the first applicant. Until 27 October 2015, date of the latest information from the parties on that point, the municipal authorities had not replied to that query, and the Directorate’s regional office had for that reason not proceeded with the demolition.\n21: On an unspecified date in the second half of October 2015, again after notice of the application had been given to the Government, a social worker interviewed the first applicant and explained to her the possibilities to request social services. The first applicant stated that she was not interested in that because she preferred to remain in the house.\n22: According to a register available on the website of the National Building Control Directorate (), on 10 March 2016 the demolition had not yet been carried out.\n23: By sections 148(5) and 183(1) of the Territorial Organisation Act 2001, to obtain a permit to build on a plot of land which is co-owned by two or more persons, the co-owner who intends to do so must obtain the assent of the other co-owners. The administrative courts have upheld refusals to issue a building permit where such assent is lacking (see реш. № 5170 от 21.04.2010 г. по адм. д. № 211/2010 г., ВАС, II о.), as well as decisions of the building control authorities to annul building permits because such assent had not been obtained (see реш. № 13436 от 11.11.2009 г. по адм. д. № 13811/2008 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 3266 от 12.03.2010 г. по адм. д. № 13952/2009 г., ВАС, II о.; and реш. № 1783 от 18.03.2015 г. по адм. д. № 5017/2014 г., АС-София-град).\n24: The only exception to the co-owner assent requirement is in relation to plots earmarked under the zoning regulations for low-rise or holiday housing. By section 183(4) of the 2001 Act, added in March 2009, which is similar to a rule previously set out in section 58(1) of the Territorial and Urban Planning Act 1973, in force until 2001, a co-owner may build in such a plot without having obtained the assent of the other co-owners, but only if these co-owners have themselves constructed or started to construct, or have the right to construct, their own separate buildings in the same plot.\n25: Section 148(1) of the Territorial Organisation Act 2001 provides that buildings may only be constructed if they have been duly authorised in accordance with the Act.\n26: By section 225(2)(2) of the Act, a building or a part of a building constructed without a building permit is illegal and subject to demolition. Unless falling under the amnesty provisions set out in the Act’s transitional provisions (see paragraphs 28 and 29 below), it cannot subsequently be legalised. The Supreme Administrative Court has held that this legislative solution demonstrates the heightened public interest in controlling the security, hygiene and aesthetics of construction; that the exact manner in which a building fails to conform to the building regulations is irrelevant, since all buildings put up without a permit are subject to demolition; and that this does not run counter to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see реш. № 9768 от 04.07.2012 г. по адм. д. № 6382/2012 г., ВАС, II о.). On that basis, the administrative courts have held that even if a building is not in breach of the local zoning plan or other legal requirements, it must be demolished if it has been constructed without a permit (see реш. № 4726 от 9.04.2009 г. по адм. д. № 14546/2008 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 1772 от 30.10.2014 г. по адм. д. № 544/2014 г., АС-Бургас, upheld by реш. № 1930 от 23.02.2015 г. по адм. д. № 75/2015 г., ВАС, II о.; and реш. № 505 от 12.12.2015 г. по адм. д. № 496/2015 г., АС-Велико Търново).\n27: The Supreme Administrative Court has also held that the building control authorities do not have discretion in relation to the removal of illegally constructed buildings, and that the only course of action lawfully open to them in such cases is to order their demolition (see реш. № 13030 от 04.11.2009 г. по адм. д. № 7857/2009 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 3032 от 01.03.2011 г. по адм. д. № 15764/2010 г., ВАС, II о.; and реш. № 942 от 01.2015 г. по адм. д. № 7908/2014 г., ВАС, II о.); that in such cases those authorities are not bound by the general requirement of proportionality laid down in Article 6 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006, because it only applies to situations in which they enjoy discretion (see реш. № 4035 от 22.03.2013 г. по адм. д. № 632/2013 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 15733 от 11.2013 г. по адм. д. № 9665/2013 г., ВАС, II о.; and реш. № 1876 от 11.02.2014 г. по адм. д. № 12967/2013 г., ВАС, II о.); and that under the Territorial Organisation Act 2001 it is irrelevant whether the demolition of an illegally constructed building would cause harm to those concerned (see реш. № 13426 от 10.11.2014 г. по адм. д. № 10090/ 2014 г., ВАС, II о.). Lastly, it has held that persons who are not addressees of a demolition order are not entitled to challenge it by way of judicial review (see реш. № 9768 от 04.07.2012 г. по адм. д. № 6382/2012 г., ВАС, II о., and опр. № 9877 от 01.07.2013 г. по адм. д. № 7387/2013 г., ВАС, II о.).\n28: By paragraph 16(1) of the transitional provisions of the 2001 Act, buildings constructed before 7 April 1987 without the requisite papers but otherwise in line with the building and zoning regulations applicable at the time of their construction are not subject to demolition. By paragraph 16(2), buildings constructed between 8 April 1987 and 30 June 1998 but not legalised before the Act’s entry into force on 31 March 2001 are likewise not subject to demolition if they were in line with the building and zoning regulations applicable at the time of their construction and were declared by their owners before the end of 1998. Paragraph 16(3) provides the same with respect to buildings whose construction has started after 30 June 1998, but only if their owners have declared them before the competent authorities within six months after the Act’s entry into force.\n29: By paragraph 127(1) of the transitional and concluding provisions of a 2012 Act for the amendment of the 2001 Act, buildings constructed before 31 March 2001 without the requisite papers but tolerable under the building regulations applicable at the time of their construction or under the current building regulations are not subject to demolition either.\n30: In a judgment of 1 June 2015 (реш. № 6293 от 01.06.2015 г. по адм. д. № 6855/2014 г., ВАС, III о.), the Supreme Administrative Court dealt with a claim for damages brought against the building control authorities by a person whose house had been demolished on their orders. The claim concerned the alleged unlawfulness of the enforcement of the demolition order, and the claimant relied on, inter alia, Article 8 of the Convention. In upholding the lower court’s decision to dismiss the claim, the Supreme Administrative Court analysed the demolition in terms of that Article, finding that it had amounted to an interference with the claimant’s right to respect for her home. It said that the enforcement authority should have taken into account that the house had been the claimant’s only home. It however went on to conclude that that interference had been proportionate because (a) the claimant had not attempted to legalise the house under the amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above) as she could have, since the house fell under them; (b) the claimant had not attempted to seek judicial review of the enforcement under Article 294 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 (see paragraph 35 below) or to obtain a declaratory judgment under Article 292 of that Code (see paragraph 33 below) on the basis that after the demolition order she had procured a certificate attesting that the house had been built in 1984 and could be tolerated; and (c) the claimant had been able to rent a dwelling after her eviction from the house, which showed that she had means to afford alternative accommodation.\n31: By Article 278 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006, the enforcement of a final administrative decision may be fully or partly postponed by the competent administrative enforcement authority if it cannot be enforced immediately by reason of the financial situation of the person against whom it is directed or another objective impediment. By Article 278 § 2, enforcement may be postponed fully for fourteen days, and partly for a maximum of two months. By Article 278 § 3, the decision to postpone the enforcement or refuse to do so is not subject to legal challenge.\n32: With one exception (see реш. № 98 от 05.06.2012 г. по адм. д. № 147/2012 г., АС-Стара Загора, upheld by реш. № 15346 от 04.12.2012 г. по адм. д. № 9645/2012 г., ВАС, II о.), the administrative courts have consistently refused to examine such challenges in relation to proceedings for the enforcement of demolition orders (see опр. № 2989 от 06.03.2009 г. по адм. д. № 2480/2009 г., ВАС, II о.; опр. № 3298 от 11.03.2009 г. по адм. д. № 2921/2009 г., ВАС, II о.; опр. № 3768 от 20.03.2009 г. по адм. д. № 2481/2009 г., ВАС, II о.; опр. № 12660 от 15.10.2012 г. по адм. д. № 10151/2012 г., ВАС, II о.; опр. № 13269 от 06.11.2014 г. по адм. д. № 13375/2014 г., ВАС, II о.; опр. № 14149 от 26.11.2014 г. по адм. д. № 14120/2014 г., ВАС, II о.; опр. № 149 от 08.01.2015 г. по адм. д. № 15083/2014 г., ВАС, II о.; and опр. № 965 от 27.01.2015 г. по адм. д. № 12327/2014 г., ВАС, II о.).\n33: By Article 292 of the Code, it is possible to contest the enforcement by way a claim for a judicial declaration on the basis of new facts which have emerged after the decision which is due to be enforced.\n34: Under the Supreme Administrative Court’ case-law, to be regarded as new, the facts must have occurred after the close of the proceedings for judicial review of the demolition order (see реш. № 1317 от 02.02.2010 г. по адм. д. № 11193/2009 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 669 от 15.01.2013 г. по адм. д. № 11464/2012 г., ВАС, II о.; and реш. № 3285 от 10.03.2014 г. по адм. д. № 14922/2013 г., ВАС, II о.) or, if the order has not been contested in such proceedings, the close of the administrative proceedings leading to its issuing (see реш. № 6059 от 08.05.2014 г. по адм. д. № 248/2014 г., ВАС, II о.). That court has held that the lapse of the limitation period for enforcement is a new fact (see реш. № 9071 от 30.06.2010 г. по адм. д. № 5508/2010 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 2536 от 21.02.2012 г. по адм. д. № 13701/2011 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 3039 от 4.03.2013 г. по адм. д. № 14984/2012 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 8567 от 14.06.2013 г. по адм. д. № 5906/2013 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 3288 от 10.03.2014 г. по адм. д. № 15163/2013 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 6291 от 12.05.2014 г. по адм. д. № 507/2014 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 6973 от 26.05.2014 г. по адм. д. № 859/2014 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 7224 от 28.05.2014 г. по адм. д. № 342/2014 г., ВАС, II о.; реш. № 15428 от 17.12.2014 г. по адм. д. № 11539/2014 г., ВАС, II о.; and реш. № 11888 от 10.11.2015 г. по адм. д. № 6136/2015 г., ВАС, II о.), as is the legalisation of a building by the competent authorities (see реш. № 944 от 27.01.2015 г. по адм. д. № 8411/2014 г., ВАС, II о.), but that the issuing of a certificate that a building can be tolerated under the amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above) is not (see реш. № 6023 от 26.05.2015 г. по адм. д. № 11540/2014 г., ВАС, II о.).\n35: By Articles 294 et seq. of the Code, the decisions, actions or omissions of an administrative enforcement authority are subject to judicial review by the competent first-instance administrative court at the instance of the parties to the enforcement proceedings or any third parties whose rights, freedoms or lawful interests have been affected by them. By Article 298 § 4, the court’s judgment is not subject to appeal.\n36: The Supreme Administrative Court has held that persons who are not addressees of a demolition order and whose property rights would not be affected by its enforcement are not entitled to challenge its enforcement under those provisions (see опр. № 7946 от 16.06.2009 г. по адм. д. № 3935/2009 г., ВАС, II о.). However, in a more recent case the Lovech Administrative Court found, in a final judgment, that persons claiming that the enforcement of a demolition order would affect their right to respect for their home within the meaning of Article 8 § 1 of the Convention are entitled to challenge that enforcement under Article 294 et seq. of the Code (see реш. № 7 от 13.01.2016 г. по адм. д. № 156/2015 г., АС-Ловеч).\n37: In three final judgments given in March and July 2013 and February 2014 (реш. № 749 от 22.03.2013 г. по адм. д. № 911/2013 г., АС-Варна; реш. 1782 от 04.07.2013 г. по адм. д. № 1650/2013 г., АС-Варна; and реш. № 929 от 17.04.2014 г. по адм. д. № № 911/2013 г., АС-Варна), the Varna Administrative Court dismissed claims under Article 294 of the Code in relation to the demolition of a building which was the claimants’ only home. It examined the matter by reference to the principle of proportionality, as enshrined in Article 6 of the Code (see paragraph 27 above) and Article 8 of the Convention, but held that even though the building was the claimants’ only home, it was still subject to demolition because it was illegal and because there were no alternative means of combatting illegal construction, especially considering that the claimants had knowingly erected the building in a zone where construction was prohibited. Any arguments relating to their poor health or lack of means were irrelevant. The balance between the competing interests had been resolved at the legislative level. Holding otherwise would mean that illegal buildings inhabited by persons in poor health or persons who had no other place to live could not be demolished, which would render building regulations nugatory. The claimants then managed, on the basis of the same arguments, to obtain the discontinuance by the building control authorities of the proceedings for the enforcement of the demolition order. However, in a final judgment of 22 June 2015 (реш. № 1399 от 22.06.2015 г. по адм. д. № 1230/2015 г., АС-Варна), the Varna Administrative Court, acting pursuant to a claim brought by the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office, declared that discontinuance null and void on the basis that it had impermissibly been based on arguments already examined and rejected in a final judgment.\n38: In a final judgment of 6 March 2015 (реш. № 6 от 06.03.2015 г. по адм. д. № 47/2015 г., АС-Хасково), the Haskovo Administrative Court dismissed a claim under Article 294 of the Code in relation to the demolition of a building which was the claimants’ only home. It held that it could not discuss the claimants’ arguments relating to the proportionality of the demolition because they did not concern the lawfulness of the enforcement but the lawfulness of the demolition order, which had already been upheld in prior judicial review proceedings.\n39: In two final judgments given in January 2016 (реш. № 5 от 06.01.2016 г. по адм. д. № 112/2015 г., АС-Ловеч, and реш. № 7 от 13.01.2016 г. по адм. д. № 156/2015 г., АС-Ловеч), the Lovech Administrative Court dismissed claims under Article 294 of the Code in relation to the demolition of buildings which were the claimants’ only home. Like the Varna Administrative Court and unlike the Haskovo Administrative Court, it examined the matter by reference to the principle of proportionality, as enshrined in Article 6 of the Code (see paragraph 27 above) and Article 8 of the Convention, but held that even though the buildings were the claimants’ only home, they were still subject to demolition because they were illegal and because there were no alternative means of combatting illegal construction.\n40: In four final decisions of 15 September 2015 (опр. № 995 от 15.09.2015 г. по адм. д. № 705/2015 г., АС-Пазарджик; опр. № 996 от 15.09.2015 г. по адм. д. № 707/2015 г., АС-Пазарджик; опр. № 997 от 15.09.2015 г. по адм. д. № 708/2015 г., АС-Пазарджик; опр. № 1002 от 15.09.2015 г. по адм. д. № 706/2015 г., АС-Пазарджик), the Pazardzhik Administrative Court imposed interim measures in proceedings under Article 294 of the Code relating to houses inhabited by a number of Roma families on the basis that the immediate enforcement of the orders for their demolition would render those families homeless. However, when it later examined the legal challenges under Article 294 of the Code on their merits, the court declared the steps taken to enforce the demolition orders null and void on the basis that they had not been taken by a competent authority (see реш. № 599 от 13.10.2015 г. по адм. д. № 708/2015 г., АС-Пазарджик; реш. № 617 от 22.10.2015 г. по адм. д. № 705/2015 г., АС-Пазарджик; реш. № 624 от 23.10.2015 г. по адм. д. № 707/2015 г.; and реш. № 728 от 10.12.2015 г. по адм. д. № 706/2015 г., АС-Пазарджик).\n41: In his report for 2012 (), the Ombudsman of the Republic said, at p. 98, that it was important for the building control authorities to exercise preventive control of illegal construction, and that demolition was an extreme measure that could fall foul of the principle of proportionality enshrined in Article 6 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006. This was especially important when it came to the demolition of a building which was a person’s only home.\n42: In his report for 2013 (), the Ombudsman said, at pp. 92-93, that the building control authorities did not exercise sufficient preventive control of illegal construction and thus often had to resort to the harshest measure: demolition. In his view, there were not enough guarantees that when such measures would affect the only home of the person concerned, his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention would be respected.\n43: In his report for 2014 (), the Ombudsman said, at p. 80, that the aim of the law was more generally to deter illegal construction rather than just liquidate already existing illegal buildings. He reiterated the need to carry out preventive control and to adhere to the principle of proportionality under Article 6 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 when measures of building control affected a person’s only home.\n44: By section 36(4) of the Bar Act 2004, lawyers’ fees may be stipulated as a percentage of the pecuniary interest at issue in the proceedings depending on their outcome, except in criminal cases and cases in which the dispute does not concern pecuniary interests. Although finding that unpaid sums due under such agreements are not recoverable as costs, the Supreme Court of Cassation held that such agreements are permitted between lawyers and clients (see тълк. реш. № 6 от 06.11.2013 г. по тълк. д. № 6/2012 г., ВКС, ОСГТК). The courts have allowed claims by lawyers against clients for such contingency fees (see, for example, реш. № 222 от 24.06.2014 г. по гр. д. № 152/2014 г., ОС-Добрич, and реш. oт 14.04.2015 г. по гр. д. № 70677/2014 г., РС-Монтана, both final).\n45: The applicants complained that the demolition of the house in which they live would be in breach of their right to respect for their home. They relied on Article 8 of the Convention, which provides, in so far as relevant:\n46: The Government submitted that the decision ordering the demolition of the house in which the applicants lived was lawful. It had been judicially reviewed and upheld. It was also necessary for the protection of public safety. The national authorities had a wide margin of appreciation to tackle the problem of illegal construction. The impossibility to legalise unlawful buildings had been put in place in view of the strong public interest to ensure the safety, hygiene and aesthetics of construction. The demolition of a building because it had been erected without a permit was a proportionate measure required in all cases and not capable of being eschewed at the discretion of the building control authorities. Those authorities had acted straight away when apprised of the illegality of the house inhabited by the applicants, and had not tolerated an illegal situation for a long time: the applicants had started inhabiting the house at the earliest in 2009 and the demolition procedure had started in 2011. The applicants had constructed the house knowing full well that they had not obtained the required permit. All such buildings, unless falling under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, were subject to demolition; the courts had inquired into that point in the applicants’ case. The authorities had allowed the first applicant to comment on the intended demolition, and had invited her to comply with the demolition order of her own accord. In as much as she argued that she had no other place to live, it had to be noted that in June 2013, after the beginning of the demolition proceedings, she had donated a flat that she owned in Burgas and that, although the authorities did not have an obligation to provide the applicants, who did not belong to a particularly vulnerable group, with alternative accommodation, they had explored the possibility of settling them in a municipal flat. The second applicant was in receipt of a sufficiently high pension and the first applicant was able to work. They could thus afford to pay market rent in Sinemorets, and their personal circumstances were not as dire as they sought to paint them. The authorities had endeavoured to take all these matters into account when sending a social worker to interview the first applicant. It was equally possible to have the proportionality of the demolition reviewed in proceedings under Article 278 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006. The interference with the applicants’ right to respect for their home was therefore proportionate. Article 8 of the Convention could not be construed as precluding the enforcement of the building regulations in respect of those who sought to flout them, or as requiring the authorities to provide persons in the applicants’ situation with a place to live.\n47: The applicants submitted that they had lived in the house undisturbed for nearly seven years, even though the local authorities were fully aware that it had been constructed without a permit, as the applicants had paid taxes in respect of the house and had their address registration there, and as Sinemorets was a small village. It was moreover widely known that many buildings in villages and small towns in Bulgaria had been constructed without a permit. The Ombudsman of the Republic had commented on that, saying that the authorities did not systematically combat illegal construction and had to do so pre-emptively rather than ex post facto. In spite of that recommendation, the only way of dealing with illegal buildings envisaged by the law was their demolition. The applicants were particularly vulnerable because the second applicant was handicapped and had a small pension, and the first applicant had been unemployed since 2003. The only illegality affecting the house was that it had been constructed without a permit; it otherwise fully complied with the applicable regulations. The public interest did not require its demolition, which would result in rendering two elderly persons with health problems homeless. The rules governing the demolition of buildings constructed without a permit, as interpreted by the Supreme Administrative Court, did not envisage any proportionality assessment or a procedure affording proper guarantees in that respect, and did not leave any discretion to the competent authorities, which were required to enforce them regardless of individual circumstances.\n48: The complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention or inadmissible on other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n49: Although only the first applicant has legal rights to the house, both applicants have in fact lived in it for a number of years (see paragraphs 8 and 11 above). It is therefore “home” for both of them (see, among other authorities, Buckley v. the United Kingdom, 25 September 1996, § 54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV; Prokopovich v. Russia, no. 58255/00, §§ 36-39, ECHR 2004-XI (extracts); McCann v. the United Kingdom, no. 19009/04, § 46, ECHR 2008; Yordanova and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 25446/06, §§ 102-03, 24 April 2012; and Winterstein and Others v. France, no. 27013/07, § 141, 17 October 2013), and the order for its demolition amounts to an interference with their right to respect for that home (see, mutatis mutandis, Ćosić v. Croatia, no. 28261/06, § 18, 15 January 2009; Yordanova and Others, cited above, § 104; and Winterstein and Others, cited above, § 143).\n50: The interference was lawful. The demolition order had a clear legal basis in section 225(2)(2) of the Territorial Organisation Act 2001 (see paragraphs 12 and 26 above). It was upheld, following fully adversarial proceedings, by two levels of court (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above), and there is nothing to suggest that it was not otherwise “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention.\n51: The Court is satisfied that the demolition would pursue a legitimate aim. Even if its only purpose is to ensure the effective implementation of the regulatory requirement that no buildings can be constructed without permit, it may be regarded as seeking to re-establish the rule of law (see, mutatis mutandis, Saliba v. Malta, no. 4251/02, § 44, 8 November 2005), which, in the context under examination, may be regarded as falling under “prevention of disorder” and as promoting the “economic well-being of the country”. This is particularly relevant for Bulgaria, where the problem of illegal construction appears to be rife (see paragraphs 41-43 above).\n52: Thus, the salient issue is whether the demolition would be “necessary in a democratic society”. On this point, the case bears considerable resemblance with cases concerning the eviction of tenants from public housing (see McCann, cited above; Ćosić, cited above; Paulić v. Croatia, no. 3572/06, 22 October 2009; Kay and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 37341/06, 21 September 2010; Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy v. Ukraine, no. 30856/03, 2 December 2010; Igor Vasilchenko v. Russia, no. 6571/04, 3 February 2011; and Bjedov v. Croatia, no. 42150/09, 29 May 2012), and cases concerning the eviction of occupiers from publicly owned land (see Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27238/95, ECHR 2001-I; Connors v. the United Kingdom, no. 66746/01, 27 May 2004; Yordanova and Others, cited above; Buckland v. the United Kingdom, no. 40060/08, 18 September 2012; and Winterstein and Others v. France, no. 27013/07, 17 October 2013). An analogy may also be drawn with cases concerning evictions from properties previously owned by the applicants but lost by them as a result of civil proceedings brought by a private person, civil proceedings brought by a public body, or tax enforcement proceedings (see, respectively, Zehentner v. Austria, no. 20082/02, 16 July 2009 (proceedings brought by a creditor); Brežec v. Croatia, no. 7177/10, 18 July 2013 (proceedings brought by the true owner of the premises); Gladysheva v. Russia, no. 7097/10, 6 December 2011 (proceedings brought by a municipal body); and Rousk v. Sweden, no. 27183/04, 25 July 2013 (tax enforcement proceedings)).\n53: Under the Court’s well-established case-law, as expounded in those judgments, the assessment of the necessity of the interference in cases concerning the loss of one’s home for the promotion of a public interest involves not only issues of substance but also a question of procedure: whether the decision-making process was such as to afford due respect to the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see Connors, § 83; McCann, § 49; Kay and Others, § 67; Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy, § 44; and Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iii), all cited above). Since the loss of one’s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home, any person risking this – whether or not belonging to a vulnerable group – should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under that Article (see, among other authorities, McCann, § 50; Ćosić, § 22; Zehentner, § 59; Kay and Others, § 68; Buckland, § 65; and Rousk, § 137, all cited above). The factors likely to be of prominence in this regard, when it comes to illegal construction, are whether or not the home was established unlawfully, whether or not the persons concerned did so knowingly, what is the nature and degree of the illegality at issue, what is the precise nature of the interest sought to be protected by the demolition, and whether suitable alternative accommodation is available to the persons affected by the demolition (see Chapman, cited above, §§ 102-04). Another factor could be whether there are less severe ways of dealing with the case; the list is not exhaustive. Therefore, if the person concerned contests the proportionality of the interference on the basis of such arguments, the courts must examine them carefully and give adequate reasons in relation to them (see Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iv) in fine, and Winterstein and Others, § 148 (δ) in fine, both cited above); the interference cannot normally be regarded as justified simply because the case falls under a rule formulated in general and absolute terms. The mere possibility of obtaining judicial review of the administrative decision causing the loss of the home is thus not enough; the person concerned must be able to challenge that decision on the ground that it is disproportionate in view of his or her personal circumstances (see McCann, §§ 51-55; Ćosić, §§ 21-23; and Kay and Others, § 69-74, all cited above). Naturally, if in such proceedings the national courts have regard to all relevant factors and weigh the competing interests in line with the above principles – in other words, where there is no reason to doubt the procedure followed in a given case – the margin of appreciation allowed to those courts will be a wide one, in recognition of the fact that they are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions, and the Court will be reluctant to gainsay their assessment (see Pinnock and Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31673/11, §§ 28-34, 24 September 2013).\n54: The Court cannot agree with the position, expressed by some Bulgarian administrative courts, that the balance between the rights of those who stand to lose their homes and the public interest to ensure the effective implementation of the building regulations can as a rule properly be struck by way of an absolute rule permitting of no exceptions (see paragraphs 26 and 37 above). Such an approach could be sustained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which gives the national authorities considerable latitude in dealing with illegal construction (see paragraphs 73-76 below), or in other contexts (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, §§ 106-09, ECHR 2013 (extracts), with further references). But given that the right to respect for one’s home under Article 8 of the Convention touches upon issues of central importance to the individual’s physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community, the balancing exercise under that provision in cases where the interference consists in the loss of a person’s only home is of a different order, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of those concerned (see Connors, cited above, § 82). This can normally only be examined case by case. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Bulgarian legislature has given active consideration to this balance, or that in opting for a wholesale rather than a more narrowly tailored solution it has taken into account the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, § 89, ECHR 2013 (extracts), and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Animal Defenders International, cited above, §§ 114-16). On the contrary, the Ombudsman of the Republic has repeatedly expressed concern in that regard (see paragraphs 41-43 above).\n55: Nor can the Court accept the suggestion that the possibility for those concerned to challenge the demolition of their homes by reference to Article 8 of the Convention would seriously undermine the system of building control in Bulgaria (see paragraph 37 above). It is true that the relaxation of an absolute rule may entail risks of abuse, uncertainty or arbitrariness in the application of the law, expense, and delay. But it can surely be expected that the competent administrative authorities and the administrative courts, which routinely deal with various claims relating to the demolition of illegal buildings (see paragraphs 26, 27, 34 and 37-39 above), and have recently showed that they can examine such claims in the light of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 30 above), will be able to tackle those risks, especially if they are assisted in this task by appropriate parameters or guidelines. Moreover, it would only be in exceptional cases that those concerned would succeed in raising an arguable claim that demolition would be disproportionate in their particular circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann, § 54; Paulić, § 43; and Bjedov, § 67, all cited above).\n56: The proceedings conducted in this case did not meet the above-mentioned procedural requirements, as set out in paragraph 53. The entire focus of those proceedings, in which the first applicant sought judicial review of the demolition order – the second applicant, not having any property rights over the house and not being an addressee of the order, would not have even had standing to take part in them (see paragraph 26 in fine above) – was whether the house had been built without a permit and whether it was nevertheless exempt from demolition because it fell within the transitional amnesty provisions of the relevant statute (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). In her appeal, the first applicant raised, albeit briefly, the points that the applicants now put before the Court: that the house was her only home and that she would be severely affected by its demolition (see paragraph 15 above). The Supreme Administrative Court did not even mention, let alone substantively engage with this point (see, mutatis mutandis, Brežec, cited above, § 49). This is hardly surprising, as under Bulgarian law it is not relevant for the demolition order’s lawfulness. Under the applicable statutory provisions, as construed by the Supreme Administrative Court, any building constructed without a permit is subject to demolition, unless it falls under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, and it is not open to the administrative authorities to refrain from demolishing it on the basis that this would cause disproportionate harm to those affected by that measure (see paragraphs 25-27 above).\n57: The possibility, adverted to by the Government (see paragraphs 46 above and 78 below), to seek postponement of the enforcement of the demolition order under Article 278 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 (see paragraph 31 above) could not have remedied that (see, mutatis mutandis, Paulić, § 44, and Bjedov, § 71, both cited above). All the applicants could have obtained in proceedings under that provision – which are conducted solely before the administrative enforcement authority rather than an independent tribunal, with no possibility for judicial review of the decisions taken in their course – would have been a temporary reprieve from the effects of the demolition order rather than a comprehensive examination of its proportionality (see paragraph 32 above).\n58: Nor does it appear that, as suggested by the Supreme Administrative Court in its judgment of 1 June 2015 in a similar case (see paragraph 30 above), it would have been possible, as matters stand, to obtain a proper examination of the proportionality of the demolition by seeking judicial review of the enforcement of the demolition order under Article 294 et seq. of the 2006 Code (see paragraph 35 above). Such examination could in principle be carried out in proceedings for judicial review of enforcement (see J.L. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 66387/10, §§ 44-46, 30 September 2014). But the case-law under these provisions shows that the Bulgarian administrative courts generally decline to examine arguments relating to the individual situation of the persons concerned by the demolition. They do so either on the basis that the proper balance between their rights under Article 8 of the Convention and the countervailing public interest to combat illegal construction has been resolved at the legislative level and that demolition is the only means of tackling illegal construction, or that such points can only be examined in proceedings for judicial review of the demolition order itself (see paragraphs 37-39 above). The only court that appears to have shown some willingness to entertain such arguments in proceedings under Article 294 et seq. of the Code is the Pazardzhik Administrative Court, which however did so when imposing interim measures in such proceedings rather than when dealing with the merits of the cases (see paragraph 40 above). It is also unclear whether persons in the position of the second applicant, who is not the addressee of the demolition order and has no property rights over the house, would have standing to bring such a challenge (see paragraph 36 above).\n59: The applicants could not have obtained a proper examination of the proportionality of the demolition by bringing a claim for declaratory judgment under Article 292 of the 2006 Code either (see paragraph 33 above). The case-law under that provision, which is only intended to prevent the enforcement of administrative decisions where newly emerged facts militate against it, shows that in such proceedings the Bulgarian administrative courts just check whether facts which have come to pass after the issuing or the demolition order or its upholding by the courts – such as a lapse of the limitation period for enforcement or an intervening legalisation of the building – could preclude enforcement (see paragraph 34 above). There appears to be no case in which the courts have allowed such a claim, and thus blocked the enforcement of a demolition order, on the basis of arguments relating to the personal circumstances of those concerned. Moreover, in the applicants’ case the enforcement proceedings started less than one month after the demolition order was upheld by the courts (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above).\n60: The involvement of the social services, which only occurred after notice of the application had been given to the Government (see paragraph 21 above), could not make good the lack of a proper proportionality assessment. It did not take place within the framework of a procedure capable of resulting in a comprehensive review of the proportionality of the demolition (see, mutatis mutandis, Yordanova and Others, cited above, §§ 136-37). In any event, even though the first applicant stated that she was not interested in social services, the Government emphasised that the authorities had no obligation to provide the applicants with alternative accommodation and did not clearly explain in what way those services would have provided the applicants with a satisfactory solution.\n61: In sum, the applicants did not have at their disposal a procedure enabling them to obtain a proper review of the proportionality of the intended demolition of the house in which they live in the light of their personal circumstances.\n62: The Court therefore finds that there would be a breach of Article 8 of the Convention if the order for the demolition of the house in which the applicants live were to be enforced without such review.\n63: The first applicant further complained that the demolition of the house, part of which belonged to her, would be a disproportionate interference with the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions. She relied on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which provides as follows:\n64: The Government submitted that the complaint was incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of Protocol No. 1 in so far as the second applicant was concerned, because only the first applicant had title to the house. Moreover, in as much as the house had been illegally constructed without being tolerated by the authorities for a long time, it could not be regarded as a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In the alternative, the Government submitted that the interference with the first applicant’s possessions was justified. The demolition, which was a measure of control of property, was lawful and would not impose an excessive burden on the applicants as their financial situation, as evident from the property disposal transactions carried out by them, was not so dire, and as they had wilfully acted in defiance of the law. Moreover, the house did not exclusively belong to the first applicant; the other co-owners of the plot were entitled to a share of it, and some of them had objected to its construction. The legitimate aim sought to be achieved by the demolition was to enforce the building regulations, which required a permit for each newly constructed building. In constructing the house without a permit, the applicants had knowingly acted in breach of the law and had disregarded the other co-owners’ interests.\n65: The applicants submitted that the complaint had only been raised by the first applicant, who had legal rights over the house even though it had been illegally constructed. It was therefore a “possession”. Nothing would be achieved by demolishing it. It would not benefit the other co-owners of the plot, who had displayed no wish to take care of the property and whose interests would be better served if they were allotted a share of the house. Nor would it advance the public interest, which could be vindicated by less invasive measures, such as a financial penalty. The applicants had built the house to have a place to live when they grew old. In 2005 the first applicant had approached one of the other co-owners to obtain his assent to the construction, but he had tried to wring a disproportionate amount of money out of her in exchange for that. That was why the applicants had proceeded with the construction without obtaining a permit.\n66: It should be noted at the outset that this complaint was only raised by the first applicant. It is therefore not necessary to rule on the Government’s objection in relation to the second applicant.\n67: The parties have diverging views on whether the first applicant has a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No.1 and whether that provision is thus applicable. But in this case it is more appropriate to examine this question on the merits (see, mutatis mutandis, Depalle v. France (dec.), no. 34044/02, 29 April 2008, and Yordanova and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 25446/06, 14 September 2010). The complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention or inadmissible on other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n68: Since in Bulgaria it is settled law that illegal buildings can be the objects of the right to property, and since the Burgas Regional Court held that the first applicant is the owner of 484.43 out of the 625 shares of both the plot and the house built on it (see paragraph 9 above), there can be no doubt that she has a “possession” and that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is applicable.\n69: The intended demolition of the house will in turn amount to an interference with the first applicant’s possessions (see Allard v. Sweden, no. 35179/97, § 50, ECHR 2003-VII, and Hamer v. Belgium, no. 21861/03, § 77, ECHR 2007-V (extracts)). Being meant to ensure compliance with the general rules concerning the prohibitions on construction, this interference amounts to a “control [of] the use of property” (see Hamer, cited above, § 77, and Saliba, cited above, § 35). It therefore falls to be examined under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n70: The demolition order had a clear legal basis in section 225(2)(2) of the Territorial Organisation Act 2001 (see paragraphs 12 and 26 above). It was upheld, following fully adversarial proceedings, by two levels of court (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). The interference is therefore lawful for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n71: It can also be accepted that the interference, which seeks to ensure compliance with the building regulations, is “in accordance with the general interest” (see Saliba, cited above, § 44). At the same time, it should be noted that the demolition order, although the product of a denunciation by the first applicant’s co-owners (see paragraph 11 above), was not premised on the first applicant’s failure to obtain their assent for the construction of the house. It cannot therefore be regarded as intended to protect their interests (contrast Allard, cited above, § 52). It follows that the weight of those interests is not a pertinent consideration in this case (contrast Allard, cited above, § 60).\n72: The salient issue is whether the interference would strike a fair balance between the first applicant’s interest to keep her possessions intact and the general interest to ensure effective implementation of the prohibition against building without a permit.\n73: According to the Court’s settled case-law, the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 must be read in the light of the principle set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph: that an interference needs to strike a fair balance between the general interest of the community and the individual’s rights. This means that a measure must be both appropriate for achieving its aim and not disproportionate to that aim (see, among other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 50, Series A no. 98). However, the High Contracting Parties enjoy a margin of appreciation in this respect, in particular in choosing the means of enforcement and in ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement would be justified (see, as a recent authority, Depalle v. France [GC], no. 34044/02, § 83, ECHR 2010). When it comes to the implementation of their spatial planning and property development policies, this margin is wide (see Saliba, cited above, § 45, with further references).\n74: For that reason, unlike Article 8 of the Convention, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not in such cases presuppose the availability of a procedure requiring an individualised assessment of the necessity of each measure of implementation of the relevant planning rules. It is not contrary to the latter for the legislature to lay down broad and general categories rather than provide for a scheme whereby the proportionality of a measure of implementation is to be examined in each individual case (see James and Others, cited above, § 68, and Allen and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 5591/07, § 66, 6 October 2009). There is no incongruity in this, as the intensity of the interests protected under those two Articles, and the resultant margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities under each of them, are not necessarily co-extensive (see Connors, cited above, § 82). Thus, although the Court has in some cases assessed the proportionality of a measure under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the light of largely the same factors as those that it has taken into account under Article 8 of the Convention (see Zehentner, §§ 52-65 and 70-79; Gladysheva, §§ 64-83 and 90-97; and Rousk, §§ 108-27 and 134-42, all cited above, as well as Demades v. Turkey, no. 16219/90, §§ 36-37 and 4446, 31 July 2003), this assessment is not inevitably identical in all circumstances.\n75: In the first applicant’s case, the house was knowingly built without a permit (contrast N.A. and Others v. Turkey, no. 37451/97, § 39 in fine, ECHR 2005-X, and Depalle, cited above, § 85), and therefore in flagrant breach of the domestic building regulations. In this case, regardless of the explanations that the first applicant gave for this failure, this can be regarded as a crucial consideration under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The order that the house be demolished, which was issued a reasonable time after its construction (contrast Hamer, cited above, § 83), simply seeks to put things back in the position in which they would have been if the first applicant had not disregarded the requirements of the law. The order and its enforcement will also serve to deter other potential lawbreakers (see Saliba, cited above, § 46), which must not be discounted in view of the apparent pervasiveness of the problem of illegal construction in Bulgaria (see paragraphs 41-43 above). In view of the wide margin of appreciation that the Bulgarian authorities enjoy under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in choosing both the means of enforcement and in ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement would be justified, none of the above considerations can be outweighed by the first applicant’s proprietary interest in the house.\n76: The implementation of the demolition order would therefore not be in breach of the first applicant’s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n77: The applicants complained that they did not have an effective domestic remedy in respect of their complaint under Article 8 of the Convention. They relied on Article 13 of the Convention, which provides as follows:\n78: The Government submitted that the applicants could have sought postponement of the enforcement of the demolition order under Article 278 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 on the basis of arguments relating to their financial situation and the impossibility to obtain alternative accommodation. That did not of course mean that the authorities had an unconditional obligation to provide them such accommodation. That said, there was no evidence that the applicants had taken steps to be settled in a municipal flat.\n79: The applicants submitted that a request under Article 278 of the 2006 Code was not an effective remedy. All it could achieve was a short postponement of the enforcement. The law did not envisage any way of dealing with unlawful construction other than its demolition, regardless of the degree or nature of the illegality, or the effects of the measure on the personal situation of those affected by it.\n80: The complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention or inadmissible on other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n81: However, in as much as the finding of a breach of Article 8 of the Convention was premised on the absence of a procedure in which the applicants could challenge the demolition of the house on proportionality grounds (see paragraphs 56-61 above), no separate issue arises under Article 13 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Stanková v. Slovakia, no. 7205/02, § 67, 9 October 2007, and Yordanova and Others, cited above, § 152).\n82: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n83: The applicants jointly claimed 2,000 euros (EUR) in respect of the distress experienced by them as a result of the alleged breaches of Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n84: The Government submitted that the claim was exorbitant.\n85: In this case, the award of compensation can only be based on the breach of Article 8 of the Convention. However, that breach will only take place if the decision ordering the demolition of the house in which the applicants live were to be enforced, which has for the time being not happened (see paragraph 22 above). The finding of a violation is therefore sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants (see Yordanova and Others, cited above, § 171).\n86: The applicants claimed EUR 3,280 in respect of forty-one hours of work by their legal representative on the proceedings before the Court, billed at EUR 80 per hour, plus EUR 13.73 for postage. They requested than any award made under this head be made payable to the BHC, with which their legal representative worked (see paragraph 2 above). In support of this claim, the applicants submitted two agreements between them, their legal representative and the BHC in which it was stipulated that the applicants did not have to pay any remuneration to their representative up-front but that the representative would claim her fees, plus any related expenses, in the event of a successful outcome of the case; that, in the event of a successful outcome, the fees would in fact be paid by the BHC; and that the representative agreed that any award in respect of costs and expenses could be made payable to the BHC. The applicants also submitted a time-sheet and postal receipts.\n87: The Government disputed the number of hours spent by the applicants’ legal representative on the case, saying that they were excessive in view of its low complexity and the length of the submissions that she had made on the applicants’ behalf. The sum claimed in that respect was many times higher than those envisaged for similar work in domestic proceedings and out of tune with economic realities in the country. The Government also pointed out that there was no evidence, such as an invoice or a payment document, showing that the BHC had actually paid any remuneration to the applicants’ representative.\n88: According to the Court’s settled case-law, costs and expenses are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention if it is established that they were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum.\n89: The first point in dispute was whether the costs claimed by the applicants were actually incurred. The applicants made an agreement with their representative and the BHC that is comparable to a contingency fee agreement whereby a client agrees to remunerate his lawyer only in the event of a successful outcome of the case. If legally enforceable, such agreements may show that the sums claimed are payable and therefore actually incurred (see Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, § 115, Series A no. 168). This being the case in Bulgaria (see paragraph 44 above, and compare Saghatelyan v. Armenia, no. 7984/06, § 62, 20 October 2015, and contrast Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom (Article 50), 24 February 1983, § 22, Series A no. 59, and Pshenichnyy v. Russia, no. 30422/03, § 38, 14 February 2008), the Court accepts that the costs claimed were actually incurred by the applicants, even if for the time being no payments have taken place.\n93: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

                "CASE OF McCANN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 19009/04) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Gerrard McCann (“the applicant”), on 20 May 2004.\n2: The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr Gurbinder Gill, a lawyer practising in Solihull.\n3: The applicant complained that eviction proceedings brought against him by the local authority violated Articles 6, 8 and 14 of the Convention.\n4: The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n5: On 10 May 2005 the Chamber decided that the admissibility and merits of the case should be considered jointly (Article 29 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 54A). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other’s observations.\n6: The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in . The facts of the case as submitted by the parties are as follows.\n7: In July 1998 the applicant and his wife became joint tenants of a three-bedroom family house owned by Birmingham City Council (“the local authority”). They were also secure tenants under the provisions of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 below).\n8: The marriage broke down early in 2001 and the applicant’s wife moved out of the house with the two children. On 5 April 2001, following a contested hearing at which the applicant was not represented, the court made a three-month non-molestation order and an ouster order requiring the applicant to leave the house, which he did. Mrs McCann and the children moved back into the house, but moved out again when on 14 April the applicant turned up at the house, used a crowbar to force entry and allegedly assaulted Mrs McCann and her friend. Criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant following this incident, but resulted in an acquittal when no evidence was put forward.\n9: On 18 April 2001 Mrs McCann submitted to the local authority an application to be rehoused on grounds of domestic violence. On 8 August 2001 she returned the keys to the local authority with a note saying that she was giving up the tenancy. She and the children moved into another council house which had been allocated to them in accordance with the local authority’s domestic violence policy. The local authority visited the house and found that most of the fixtures had been removed so that in excess of 15,000 pounds sterling would be required to make it habitable. Thereafter, as far as the local authority was concerned, the property was uninhabited.\n10: In November 2001 the applicant returned to the house and did a considerable amount of work to renovate it. His relationship with Mrs McCann improved and she supported his application for an exchange of accommodation with another local-authority tenant, as the three-bedroom house was too big for him but he still required a home in the area so that his children could visit.\n11: That application, dated 4 January 2002, was completed at the local-authority housing office. On the same day, a housing officer, having realised that the property was not in fact empty, and having taken legal advice, visited Mrs McCann and asked her to close the tenancy by signing a notice to quit. The County Court judge who heard the local authority’s claim for possession found as a fact that Mrs McCann was not advised and had no understanding that the notice to quit would have the effect of extinguishing the applicant’s right to live in the house or exchange it for another localauthority property (see paragraph 19 below). Approximately one week later Mrs McCann wrote to the local authority seeking to withdraw the notice to quit, but it nonetheless remained effective.\n12: The applicant was informed that the tenancy had come to an end, and he was given notice to vacate. On 11 June 2002 the local authority’s Allocations Officer Review Panel decided, inter alia, that in accordance with the domestic violence policy, the applicant would not be granted the right to accede to the former tenancy of the house and that, in any event, the applicant, who had no dependants living with him, would not qualify for a dwelling originally allocated to a qualifying family which had been rehoused.\n13: On 11 October 2002 the local authority brought possession proceedings against the applicant in the County Court, which he defended on the basis that it was contrary to his right to respect for his home under Article 8 of the Convention to be evicted on the basis of the notice to quit.\n14: In his judgment of 15 April 2003, the County Court judge held that under the common law and Housing Act (see paragraphs 19-20 below), the applicant had no defence to the authority’s claim for possession. Under Article 8 of the Convention, however, he cited previous case-law which held that in such cases, generally, the interest of the local authority as landlord and of other persons in need of social housing had been taken into account by the applicable common law and legislation, and that, provided that the local authority had acted lawfully, it was not open to a court to put aside a claim for possession, except in exceptional circumstances where it appeared that the former tenant’s Article 8 rights had not been properly considered. He noted the circumstances in which Mrs McCann had signed the notice to quit and observed that, if she had not been induced to sign it, the local authority would have had to apply for a possession order under section 84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 below). It would then have been open to the applicant to seek to persuade the court that it would not be reasonable to grant the order; he and Mrs McCann could have given evidence regarding the alleged domestic violence; and he could in addition have raised such issues as his own housing needs and the need to provide accommodation for the children when they visited. In the circumstances, the judge held that the local authority had not acted as required by Article 8 § 2 of the Convention and he dismissed the claim for possession.\n15: The authority’s appeal to the Court of Appeal was adjourned pending the outcome of proceedings before the House of Lords in London Borough of Harrow v. Qazi [2003] UKHL 43 (see paragraphs 22-25 below). On 9 December 2003 Lord Justice Mummery gave the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the present case, holding as follows:\n16: The applicant applied for judicial review of the local authority’s decision of 4 January 2002 to procure a notice to quit from his wife, and of its decision of 11 June 2002 to issue possession proceedings. The application was refused on 23 September 2004. The judge found, inter alia, that the local authority had acted within its powers in seeking, through the wife’s notice to quit, to formalise the situation as regards the tenancy and that its decision to apply its domestic violence policy where domestic violence had been established by the existence of a non-molestation injunction and ouster clause was neither unlawful nor outside the range of decisions properly open to the local authority in all the circumstances. He concluded:\n17: Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal was refused on 9 December 2004.\n18: The applicant was evicted from the house on 22 March 2005.\n19: In common law, where a valid notice to quit is given by one joint tenant, it has the effect of bringing the joint tenancy to an end, whether or not the other joint tenant knew of or consented to the service of the notice to quit (Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council v. Monk [1992] 1 All ER 1). Once a tenancy has been validly brought to an end, a former tenant remaining in the property is in law a trespasser and the landlord has a right to immediate possession.\n20: By section 82 of the Housing Act 1985, a secure tenant of a local authority or other public authority, such as the applicant, has security of tenure. Under section 84(1) of the Act, a court shall not make an order for possession of a dwelling house let under a secure tenancy except on one or more of the grounds set out in Schedule 2 to the Act. Ground 2(a) of Schedule 2 gives a ground of possession where a couple live in a dwelling-house, one or both is a tenant, one partner has left because of violence or threats of violence by the other, and the court is satisfied that that partner who has left is unlikely to return. Section 84(2) provides that the court shall not make an order for possession on one of these grounds “unless it considers it reasonable to make an order”.\n21: According to Birmingham City Council’s Allocations Policy Manual\n22: London Borough of Harrow v. Qazi [2003] UKHL 43 similarly concerned the making of a possession order in respect of a council house held under a joint tenancy of a husband and wife. The marriage broke down and the joint tenancy came to an end when Mrs Qazi served a notice to quit. Mr Qazi was refused a sole tenancy by the local authority, but he nonetheless remained in occupation with his new family, and sought to resist possession proceedings on the ground that they constituted an interference with the right to respect for his home under Article 8 of the Convention.\n23: The House of Lords were unanimous in holding that, despite the fact that the tenancy had come to an end, the property continued to be Mr Qazi’s home and Article 8 was therefore engaged. However, the majority (Lords Hope of Craighead, Millett and Scott of Foscote) held that Article 8 could not be relied upon to defeat the local authority’s proprietary or contractual rights to possession. Since the local authority had an unqualified right to immediate possession, there was no infringement of Mr Qazi’s right to respect for his home under Article 8 § 1 and so no issue arose under Article 8 § 2 as to justification. Alternatively, the effect of the authority’s proprietary or contractual rights was that any assessment under Article 8 § 2 would inevitably be determined in the local authority’s favour. The majority variously referred to a number of decisions of the Commission in which similar complaints, regarding the eviction of a former joint tenant from localauthority property after the joint tenancy had come to an end, had been declared manifestly ill-founded (see S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11716/85, Commission decision of 14 May 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 47, p. 274; D.P. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11949/86, Commission decision of 1 December 1986, DR 51, p. 195; Ure v. the , no. 28027/95, Commission decision of 27 November 1996, unreported; and Wood v. the United Kingdom, no. 32540/96, Commission decision of 2 July 1997, unreported).\n24: As to the question of remedies in exceptional cases, Lord Hope referred (in paragraph 79 of the judgment) to Sheffield City Council v. Smart [2002] EWCA Civ 4, where the Court of Appeal had held, in a case where a non-secure council tenant was evicted following nuisance proceedings, that a challenge under Article 8 of the Convention to the local authority’s decision to serve notice to quit could be made by judicial review within the appropriate time-limits. Lord Hope continued by observing that the Court of Appeal in Smart had further held:\n25: The dissenting minority (Lords Bingham of Cornhill and Steyn) held that, where there was a proposed interference with a person’s right to respect for his home, the question of justification, if raised, did fall to be considered and should, in the instant case, be remitted to the County Court. Both cited with approval the following extract from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in  Council v. Smart (cited in paragraph 24 above):\n26: In Kay v. London Borough of Lambeth; Leeds City Council v. Price, 8 March 2006, [2006] UKHL 10, the House of Lords constituted itself as a seven-judge committee (rather than five judges as usual) in order to revisit its decision in Qazi in the light of the Court’s judgments in Connors v. the United Kingdom (no. 66746/01, §§ 81-84, 27 May 2004) and Blečič v. Croatia (no. 59532/00, 29 July 2004; the latter judgment was subsequently referred to the Grand Chamber which found, on 8 March 2006, that because domestic remedies had not been exhausted, it was unable to take cognisance of the merits of the case). The Lords were unanimous in limiting their consideration to cases were the landlord was a public authority.\n27: Before proceeding to the issues arising under Article 8 § 2, I should make it clear that I entertain what is perhaps a deeper reason for my view that the case cannot be concluded by a judgment that there is no violation of Article 8 § 1. It concerns the relationship between the two paragraphs of Article 8. I have held that eviction of these appellants would constitute a prima facie violation of their right to respect for their homes. But this conclusion is not simply an instance of that everyday judicial process, the application of a statute’s correct construction (here, Article 8 § 1) to a particular set of facts. Rather it has a purposive quality. The court has to arrive at a judicial choice between two possibilities, a choice which transcends the business of finding out what the legislation’s words mean. The first choice ... would entail a judgment that the Convention requirement was met at the Article 8 § 1 stage ... The second choice (accepting a prima facie violation of Article 8 § 1), which I prefer, entails a judgment that the more rigorous and specific standards set out in Article 8 § 2 have to be met if the court is to hold that the evictions are compatible with the appellants’ Convention rights. The Convention is, as it were, much more remotely engaged in the fabric of our domestic law if the first, rather than the second, choice is taken. Part of the court’s task is to decide how close that engagement should be in the context in hand. Thus I do not eschew the first choice merely because I take the view that the second more naturally reflects the ordinary sense of the words used in Article 8 § 1. I consider as a matter of substance that the vindication and fulfilment of the Convention rights, for which purpose [the Human Rights Act 1998] was enacted, require that the domestic law procedures involved in these appeals should be subjected to scrutiny for conformity with the Article 8 § 2 standards. Such a process is demanded by the fullness of our municipal law of human rights.”\n28: The minority (Lords Bingham, Nicholls of Birkenhead and Walker of Gestingthorpe) held that a defendant to possession proceedings brought by public authorities should be permitted in principle to raise an Article 8 defence during the County Court possession proceedings. Lord Bingham expressed it as follows:\n29: The applicant alleged a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, claiming that the local authority was not an independent and impartial tribunal when it brought about the termination of the tenancy to the property.\n30: This provision ensures procedural guarantees in the determination of civil rights and obligations. In the present case, the “rights and obligations” were those arising out of the tenancy which the applicant and his wife had with the local authority. The tenancy was terminated by the applicant’s wife’s notice to quit of 4 January 2002. The determination of the civil rights and obligations, however, took place before the domestic courts – the , which gave judgment on 15 April 2003, and the Court of Appeal, which gave judgment on 9 December 2003. Any complaints concerning the fairness of the proceedings must therefore relate to the proceedings before those courts. The applicant makes no submissions as to the fairness of the proceedings before the courts, and does not submit that anything outside the proceedings as such could have had an impact on them.\n31: It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention, and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4.\n32: The applicant also alleged a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, contending that because of the way in which the Council procured the notice to quit in the case, and because the resultant proceedings were limited to bare property-law issues, his right to respect for his home was not observed.\n33: The Court considers that this part of the application raises questions of law which are sufficiently serious that their determination should depend on an examination of the merits. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established. The application must therefore be declared admissible. Pursuant to Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, the Court will consider the merits of this complaint below.\n34: Finally, the applicant, comparing his position with that of spouses of tenants who leave premises because of a relationship breakdown where there is no allegation of domestic violence, alleged a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in connection with Article 8 because the local authority has different policies for the two categories. Article 14 provides:\n35: The Court notes that the applicant did not raise the issue of Article 14 in any of the domestic proceedings, and has failed otherwise to challenge the different policies before the domestic courts. There is thus a real question as to whether the applicant has exhausted domestic remedies, as required by Article 35 of the Convention.\n36: In any event, cases involving domestic violence are not the same as cases which do not involve domestic violence, such that different treatment of them cannot, as such, be discriminatory for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention.\n37: It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention, and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4.\n38: The parties were agreed that the right to respect for the home contained in Article 8 of the Convention was engaged on the facts of the present case. They disagreed, however, as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society”.\n39: The Government contended that any interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 8 § 1 was justified within the meaning of Article 8 § 2. The local authority’s decisions to procure a notice to quit from his wife and subsequently to commence possession proceedings were taken in accordance with the law and pursued a number of legitimate aims, namely (a) the protection of the rights of the authority as owner of the property with responsibility for the management of its social housing stock; (b) the protection of the rights and freedoms of others on the authority’s waiting list to be provided with housing out of the authority’s stock of homes to meet their needs; and (c) the promotion of the economic wellbeing of the country. Furthermore, given that it was necessary in a democracy to have in place clear and certain rules governing property rights, and in view of the fact that under ordinary property law the authority had an absolute right to recover the property in question, the Government submitted that the interference which arose by virtue of the recognition and implementation of those rights by the courts was “necessary in a democratic society” and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n40: According to the Government, the present case was distinguishable from Connors (cited above, §§ 81-84; see further paragraph 49 below), where three key features had led the Court to find a violation of Article 8: firstly, the vulnerable position of Roma as a minority, which imposed a positive obligation on the State to facilitate their way of life; secondly, the absence of procedural protection, which permitted a local authority to remove Roma from an authorised site without any scrutiny by the courts; and, thirdly, the fact that the domestic law discriminated unjustifiably between Roma who resided on private sites and those who resided on local-authority sites. In contrast to the position in Connors, there was no suggestion in the present case that the domestic law of landlord and tenant was itself incompatible with Article 8.\n41: Since, in asking Mrs McCann to sign a notice to quit, the local authority had merely been seeking to regularise the situation which she had created by leaving the house and applying for alternative accommodation, it had been appropriate to ask her to sign the notice and there had been no obligation to explain to her the implications. In circumstances where the relationship between joint tenants had broken down, it was the local authority’s policy to obtain a relinquishing form from the departing tenant (see paragraph 21 above). This policy was eminently sensible, since it permitted the local-authority landlord to regain control of its property and thus to manage scarce housing resources effectively. The procedural protection against the termination of a secure tenancy contained in sections 82-84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 above) were applicable only in circumstances where the landlord was seeking to terminate the tenancy. In the present case, the joint tenancy was brought to an end by the applicant’s wife serving notice to quit.\n42: Given that the applicant’s central allegation was that the local authority had acted improperly in obtaining the notice to quit from Mrs McCann, judicial review provided an appropriate and adequate remedy, to which the applicant had had access. Moreover, it was now clear from the House of Lords’ decision in Kay (see paragraphs 26-28 above) that an individual in the applicant’s position would not need to commence proceedings by way of judicial review in order to raise this kind of public law challenge; such objections could now be raised by way of collateral challenge to possession proceedings in the County Court. The clarification in Kay served to underline the extent of the procedural protection provided to individuals in the applicant’s position. In this respect the present case was clearly distinguishable from Connors, where the applicant’s contentions (that he was not responsible for the alleged antisocial behaviour) did not relate to abuse of power by the local authority and where he was refused leave to apply for judicial review.\n43: The applicant maintained that the manner in which the notice to quit was obtained rendered his eviction an unjustified violation of his right to respect for his home. Article 8 was engaged because Mrs McCann would not have served the notice to quit except at the request of the local authority housing officer, and the local authority knew that the notice would have the effect of bringing the joint tenancy to an end without any opportunity for the applicant effectively to challenge the loss of his home. Moreover, the termination of the tenancy affected the applicant’s relationship with his children who stayed with him three nights a week. In deciding to ask Mrs McCann to sign the notice to quit, the local authority gave no consideration whatsoever to the applicant’s rights under Article 8.\n44: The only time any court had scrutinised the applicable Convention considerations, it had found that the applicant’s right to respect for his home had not been sufficiently respected. However, this decision by the County Court was overturned on appeal, in the light of the House of Lords’ judgment in Qazi, and the applicant’s subsequent request for judicial review was rejected because the Court of Appeal had previously determined the issue.\n45: In proceedings under sections 82-84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 above), the County Court must examine and determine all issues of fact and can grant possession to the landlord only where it “considers it reasonable to do so”. The local authority’s actions in obtaining the wife’s notice to quit had, in effect, bypassed this statutory scheme, which Parliament had created to protect tenants such as the applicant. While accepting that it would be rare for possession to be refused to the landlord on Article 8 grounds, the applicant contended that to exclude the possibility of individual circumstances rendering an eviction disproportionate was to deprive the Convention of any effect.\n46: The Court has noted on a number of occasions that whether a property is to be classified as a “home” is a question of fact and does not depend on the lawfulness of the occupation under domestic law (see, for example, Buckley v. the United Kingdom, 25 September 1996, § 54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, in which the applicant had lived on her own land without planning permission for a period of some eight years). In the present case, it was found by the national courts and accepted by the parties that the local-authority house which the applicant formerly occupied as a joint tenant with his wife and where he lived on his own from November 2001 continued to be his “home”, within the meaning of Article 8 § 1, despite the fact that following service by his wife of notice to quit he had no right under domestic law to continue in occupation. The Court agrees with this analysis.\n47: It was further agreed that the effect of the notice to quit, which was served by the applicant’s wife on the local authority, together with the possession proceedings which the local authority brought, was to interfere with the applicant’s right to respect for his home.\n48: The Court considers that this interference was in accordance with the law and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others in two respects. Firstly, it protected the local authority’s right to regain possession of the property against an individual who had no contractual or other right to be there. The domestic courts laid considerable emphasis on this aspect, which applies equally to all landlords who are trying to repossess property. However, the interference also pursued the aim of ensuring that the statutory scheme for housing provision was properly applied. The “others” in such a case are the intended beneficiaries of the complex arrangements set up by, among others, the Housing Acts. The Court accepts that it is only by limiting the protection of the Acts to the categories to which it applies that the policy underlying the Acts can sensibly be implemented.\n49: The central question in this case is, therefore, whether the interference was proportionate to the aim pursued and thus “necessary in a democratic society”. It must be noted that this requirement under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention raises a question of procedure as well as one of substance. The Court set out the relevant principles in assessing the necessity of an interference with the right to “home” by the application of summary possession proceedings in the case of Connors (cited above, §§ 81-84), which was decided subsequent to the House of Lords’ judgment in Qazi (see paragraphs 22-25 above), but before its decision in Kay (see paragraphs 26-28 above), as follows:\n50: The Court is unable to accept the Government’s argument that the reasoning in Connors was to be confined only to cases involving the eviction of Roma or cases where the applicant sought to challenge the law itself rather than its application in his particular case. The loss of one’s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home. Any person at risk of an interference of this magnitude should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8 of the Convention, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, his right of occupation has come to an end.\n51: The Court notes that the legislature in the  has set up, through the Housing Acts, inter alia, a complex system for the allocation of public housing, about which the applicant does not complain. That system includes, in section 84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 above), provisions to protect secure tenants of public-authority landlords, such as the applicant during the course of the joint tenancy. In accordance with these provisions, a court cannot grant a public-authority landlord possession of a property occupied by a secure tenant except on one of the specified statutory grounds and where it is in addition satisfied that it is reasonable to make such an order. Had the local authority sought to evict the applicant in accordance with this statutory scheme, it would have been open to the applicant to ask the court to examine, for example, whether his wife had really left the family home because of domestic violence and whether in his personal circumstances, including his need to provide accommodation for his children during overnight visits several times a week, it was reasonable to grant the possession order.\n52: In the present case, however, the local authority chose to bypass the statutory scheme by requesting Mrs McCann to sign a common-law notice to quit, the effect of which was immediately to terminate the applicant’s right to remain in the house. It does not appear that the authority, in the course of this procedure, gave any consideration to the applicant’s right to respect for his home. Moreover, under domestic law (see the majority opinions in Qazi and Kay, paragraphs 22-28 above), in summary proceedings such as those brought against the applicant, it was not open to the County Court to consider any issue concerning the proportionality of the possession order, save in exceptional cases where, as the Court of Appeal put it in the present case, “something has happened since the service of the notice to quit, which has fundamentally altered the rights and wrongs of the proposed eviction”. No such exceptional circumstances applied in the present case. Furthermore, although since the applicant’s landlord was a public authority it was open to him to challenge the decisions to obtain the notice to quit and to bring possession proceedings in an application for judicial review, his application failed because the local authority had not acted unlawfully.\n53: As in Connors, the “procedural safeguards” required by Article 8 for the assessment of the proportionality of the interference were not met by the possibility for the applicant to apply for judicial review and to obtain a scrutiny by the courts of the lawfulness and reasonableness of the local authority’s decisions. Judicial-review procedure is not well-adapted for the resolution of sensitive factual questions which are better left to the County Court responsible for ordering possession. In the present case, the judicialreview proceedings, like the possession proceedings, did not provide any opportunity for an independent tribunal to examine whether the applicant’s loss of his home was proportionate under Article 8 § 2 to the legitimate aims pursued.\n54: The Court does not accept that the grant of the right to the occupier to raise an issue under Article 8 would have serious consequences for the functioning of the system or for the domestic law of landlord and tenant. As the minority of the House of Lords in Kay observed (see paragraph 28 above), it would be only in very exceptional cases that an applicant would succeed in raising an arguable case which would require a court to examine the issue; in the great majority of cases, an order for possession could continue to be made in summary proceedings.\n55: It is, for present purposes, immaterial whether or not Mrs McCann understood or intended the effects of the notice to quit. Under the summary procedure available to a landlord where one joint tenant serves notice to quit, the applicant was dispossessed of his home without any possibility to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal. It follows that, because of the lack of adequate procedural safeguards, there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in the instant case.\n56: The applicant claimed just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention, which provides:\n57: The applicant claimed a total of 50,000 euros (EUR) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, including EUR 20,000 for the loss of his home, EUR 20,000 for the interference with his relationship with his children and EUR 10,000 for the suffering and distress occasioned by the humiliation of being evicted in the knowledge that the County Court judge had found it to be unjustified.\n58: The Government commented that, unlike the applicant in Connors who was evicted at short notice from his home of fifteen years, and to whom the Court awarded EUR 14,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, the present applicant had lived in the house in question for only three years before his marriage broke down and he was ordered to leave under the non-molestation order of April 2001. Furthermore, the applicant had applied for an exchange of property on 4 January 2002, as the house was too big for his needs. In these circumstances, and given that it was impossible to ascertain what the applicant’s position would have been had there been no breach of Article 8 (which was, in any event, denied), the Government submitted that the finding of a violation would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction or, in the alternative, an amount significantly lower than that in Connors should be awarded.\n59: The Court notes that it has found Article 8 violated in its procedural aspect only. Given the allegations of domestic violence against the applicant, his status as a single man (albeit one who wished to maintain regular overnight contact with his children) and the shortage of local authority housing stock, it is far from clear that, had a domestic tribunal been in a position to assess the proportionality of the eviction, the possession order would not still have been granted. Nonetheless, the applicant was deprived of his home without the opportunity to obtain a ruling on the issues under Article 8, and the Court thus concludes that he suffered some non-pecuniary damage, in particular feelings of frustration and injustice, not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention (see Connors, cited above, § 114). Deciding on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant EUR 2,000 under this head.\n60: In addition, the applicant claimed costs incurred during the domestic and  proceedings, claimed at the national inter partes rate, amounting to a total of 75,570.18 pounds sterling (GBP), of which GBP 7,691.32 represented his costs before the Court.\n61: The Government submitted that GBP 45,000 in respect of the domestic costs and GBP 6,000 for the  costs would be more than adequate.\n62: The Court awards EUR 75,000 for costs and expenses, together with any value-added tax that may be payable, less the EUR 850 already received in legal aid from the Council of Europe.\n63: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\n82: In this regard, a margin of appreciation must, inevitably, be left to the national authorities, who by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual’s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights ... On the other hand, in spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the planning context where the Court has found that ‘[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation’ ... The Court has also stated that in spheres such as housing, which play a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, it will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation ... It may be noted however that this was in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, not Article 8 which concerns rights of central importance to the individual’s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community ... Where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8 itself, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant ... .\n83: The procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has, when fixing the regulatory framework, remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 ...”"

                "FAULKNER AND MCDONAGH v. IRELAND; § 1: . The applicants are members of the Traveller community who complain principally about orders made under domestic planning legislation which required them to vacate a site they were illegally occupying. They complain that the domestic courts failed to assess the proportionality of those orders in accordance with Article 8 § 2 and that the proceedings were conducted with undue haste, with no provision of legal assistance at the court hearing at which the impugned orders were granted. The FACTS\n2: . The applicant in the first case, Ms Christina Faulkner, is an Irish national who was born in 1965 and lives in Limerick. The applicant in the second case, Ms Bridget McDonagh, is an Irish national who was born in 1962 and also lives in Limerick. Both applicants are represented before the Court by Ms S. Lucey of Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC), a lawyer practising in Dublin.\n3: . The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr B. Lysaght, of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n4: . The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The circumstances of the case Background\n5: . The applicants are sisters and members of the Traveller community which since 2017 has been officially recognised as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society.\n6: . The first applicant and her family lived on a halting site from March 2009 to July 2013, one of several sites for Travellers provided by Limerick City and County Council (“the Council”) under its statutory obligations to provide Traveller specific accommodation. The site was not designated for permanent accommodation.\n7: . The first applicant and her family left that site in July 2013, following her daughter’s death by suicide, and travelled for a time before locating their caravans on the side of the L8075-29 road at Coonagh near Limerick City (“the Coonagh site”) in September 2013. They moved there to allow their children to attend schools in a nearby suburb. She stated that she was traumatised by her daughter’s death, her older son having died in similar circumstances. At the time of their departure in December 2017, the children, aged 16, 13 and 10, were attending a local school.\n8: . The second applicant lived in private rented accommodation in Limerick City until August 2013. She then lived in a caravan on the Coonagh site with her husband M.M. and their two children. At the time of their departure in December 2017, their children were aged 21 and 16 years old. Her younger child was enrolled in a local school. Several other members of both applicants’ extended families also occupied the site during this period.\n9: . In November 2017 the Council took proceedings against thirteen named defendants and other persons occupying the site (“the 2017 proceedings”), including the two applicants (see further paragraphs 14 et seq . below). Applicants’ engagement with the housing authority\n10: . After the first applicant and her family arrived at the Coonagh site in 2013, she contacted the Council, seeking housing in the surrounding area; the application was approved, and her family were placed on the housing list. The parties disagreed regarding the Council’s efforts to provide housing. The Government claimed that the first applicant had viewed and rejected a 4 ‑ bedroom house; she stated that they were shown this house, but it was unsuitable and there was no formal offer. She accepted that she refused a three-bedroom house in March 2015, but stated that this was because, after the death of two of her children, she wanted to raise her remaining children in a safe rural area. She claimed this was the only formal offer before the 2017 proceedings commenced. The Council stated that it had also offered the family space on a halting site until other housing was available. They were also entitled to source rented accommodation, paid for by the State. The Council claimed that the first applicant had stated that she did not wish to live on a halting site or in a local authority estate. In July 2017 the first applicant provided the Council with a list of preferred areas. The Government stated that discussions between her and the Council were ongoing when the 2017 proceedings commenced. The Council, stressing the limited supply of housing, its budgetary restrictions and the competing claims of other eligible persons, argued that the first applicant’s expectations were unrealistic, that it had satisfied its statutory obligations, and that it was not required to provide her with a house of her choice in an area of her preference.\n11: . The second applicant applied for social housing support in November 2014, seeking rented accommodation in Limerick City. Her application was approved, and the family were placed on the housing list but did not receive any offer of permanent accommodation. On 10 July 2017, after living conditions on the Coonagh site deteriorated, the family contacted the Council’s Homeless Action Team and secured emergency accommodation in a hotel. For three months they used the site during the day, returning to the hotel at night. The second applicant stated that this was because they could not cook at the hotel, it lacked other basic facilities and was some distance from their daughter’s school. She stated that they returned to live full-time on the Coonagh site on 29 September 2017, because of the hotel’s effects on the mental health of her husband, who suffered from depression and had previously attempted suicide. The Government maintained that the second applicant’s family still had access to the hotel when the 2017 proceedings commenced. The family were also entitled to seek rented accommodation with State support. In October 2017, they again sought emergency accommodation. This application was approved but the parties’ submissions did not clarify the outcome. Previous enforcement proceedings\n12: . The Council, as the planning authority for Limerick County, was responsible for the enforcement of planning legislation within its jurisdiction. In 2014 the Council served a warning letter on the first applicant and her husband under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”, see further under paragraphs 43-45 below), stating that their use of the Coonagh site was an unauthorised development and requesting that they leave the site immediately. The Council then served an enforcement notice under the 2000 Act requiring them to leave the site and issued proceedings for non ‑ compliance in October 2014. These proceedings were repeatedly adjourned. New Road Scheme\n13: . In 2011 planning approval was granted for a new road scheme to reduce congestion around Limerick City. In June 2017, as part of the scheme, the Council designated a section of road on which the Coonagh site was located as a public road under the relevant legislation.\n14: . The Council appointed a contractor on 23 June 2017. After works commenced in September 2017, the contractor encountered difficulties due to the occupation of the Coonagh site. The contractor’s safety inspection stated that large vehicles using the road were passing close to caravans with young children in their vicinity, preventing the vehicles from safely accessing and leaving the construction site, and creating a significant risk to the public and to the occupants of the site. On 2 October 2017, the contractor notified the Council that works must cease until the site’s occupants were removed, submitted a contractual claim for 531,381 euros (EUR) arising from this delay and continued to charge the Council a further EUR 10,000 for every day vehicles were unable to access the construction site. Issue of 2017 proceedings by the Council\n15: . On 14 November 2017, the Council wrote to the occupants of the Coonagh site, notifying them that their occupation was illegal and requesting that they immediately remove their caravans from the site or face legal proceedings. The applicants did not leave.\n16: . On 21 November the Council filed an application for court orders under section 160 of the 2000 Act (see paragraph 46 below), preventing the applicants and the site’s other occupants from placing their caravans on the site and requiring them to remove their caravans and all other property (“the orders”).\n17: . The proceedings were supported by evidence contained in three sworn written statements (affidavits) provided by officials of the Council which detailed the importance of the road scheme and the consequences, financial and otherwise, of the defendants’ illegal occupation of the Coonagh site during construction, the Council’s efforts to provide alternative accommodation, and the position of the defendants under the relevant planning legislation.\n18: . On 21 November 2017, the Circuit Court granted an application by the Council to shorten the period between service of proceedings and the hearing of its application under section 160. The applicants were not notified in advance and were not present when that procedural application was dealt with. The applicants were formally notified of the proceedings and served with a copy of the application on Wednesday 22 November 2017. Hearing of 30 November 2017\n19: . On 24 November the applicants attended the Circuit Court and succeeded in having the hearing of the application against them adjourned until Thursday 30 November 2017. The court granted orders against the site’s other occupants.\n20: . On 28 November 2017 the applicants sought civil legal aid from the Limerick Law Centre. They were provided with letters stating that these applications were being considered and advised to seek a further adjournment from the Circuit Court on this basis.\n21: . On 30 November 2017, the applicants attended the Circuit Court unrepresented. They told the court that they had nowhere to place their caravans, stated that their children were attending local schools, claimed that they were not obstructing the road works and asked to remain over Christmas. Failing this, they sought a shorter adjournment to obtain legal aid.\n22: . The judge first asked if the applicants would agree to the orders being sought rather than opposing the Council’s application. He then asked if the Council could postpone the application for several weeks, or even for a day to confirm if legal aid was available. The Council opposed any adjournment, noting the costs being incurred and the absence of other means for the contractor access to the site (see paragraph 17 above). The Council argued that it could take a year for the Legal Aid Board to make a decision on legal aid.\n23: . The applicants refused to agree to the orders and the judge, based on the above considerations, decided not to adjourn. Before hearing the substantive application, the judge asked if alternative accommodation was available to the applicants. The Council described its previous offers to the first applicant (see paragraphs 10-11 above), noted that many other eligible persons were on the housing list and stated that no long-term housing was then available for her family. The Council noted that the second applicant had recently left emergency accommodation. The Council argued that the court had limited discretion to refuse the application where the defendants had not contested the fact that their use of the site was illegal.\n24: . The judge concluded that the Council had proved a contravention of the planning legislation and that the applicants’ presence was obstructing the works with serious consequences for the Council. He granted orders requiring the applicants to leave the site by noon on Sunday 3 December 2017. Hearing of 6 December 2017\n25: . The applicants did not leave the site. On 1 December 2017, they contacted the Limerick Law Centre seeking to appeal the Circuit Court orders. As a decision had not yet been made on their legal aid application, they were advised to lodge their own appeal, but they were unable to identify the appropriate court office to do so.\n26: . On 5 December, the Council applied to the Circuit Court seeking to bring the applicants before the court to explain their failure to comply with the orders (attachment) and, in the event they failed to provide an explanation, to imprison them for breach of the orders (committal). This application was listed for hearing on 6 December. In the interim the applicants were granted legal aid.\n27: . On 6 December, the applicants appeared in the Circuit Court legally represented. They sought to suspend (stay) the orders of 30 November until their appeal was decided. They provided sworn written statements describing their circumstances and their efforts to obtain accommodation. In support of their application they argued that, as the Council had been aware of their presence when commencing works, the circumstances leading to the original application were a contrived emergency. They questioned whether an application under section 160 was the appropriate framework in which to address proportionality under Article 8 of the Convention, though they accepted that, according to domestic case-law, such questions could in principle be examined within this context (see the case-law as it stood at that point in time cited in paragraphs 47-51 below). They stated that, as they had been unrepresented on 30 November, and the proceedings had not been based on oral evidence, they had been unable to make relevant submissions and it was unfair to expect them to do so without legal assistance. They claimed that they had had good reasons for refusing previous offers of accommodation (see paragraphs 10-11 above) and that, given the shortage of Traveller specific accommodation, it was unfair to expect them to find an alternative site for their caravans in such a short time.\n28: . The Council stated that the purpose of its application was to enforce compliance with the orders, that the applicants had no real grounds for an appeal, and as they had been notified of possible proceedings on 14 November, they had had been given sufficient time to seek representation. The Council argued that there was nothing in the established domestic case ‑ law to suggest that the Circuit Court should not have granted orders. As the applicants were not being deprived of their caravans there was no interference with their right to respect for their home under Article 8 of the Convention. The Council described in detail its previous attempts to provide accommodation and confirmed that the services of the Council’s Homeless Action Team were available to the applicants.\n29: . The judge refused to grant orders of attachment and committal against the applicants, noting that such orders would be premature as they were still within time to lodge an appeal. However, he also refused to suspend the orders of 30 November until the applicants’ appeal was heard. Instead, he extended time for compliance with those orders until noon on 10 December 2017. He stated that if the applicants failed to leave by that date, and further steps were required to enforce the orders, a new application for attachment and committal would be required. Hearing of 14 December 2017\n30: . The applicants did not leave the Coonagh site. On 11 December they lodged a High Court appeal against the original orders and a separate appeal against the Circuit Court’s refusal to suspend those orders pending their substantive appeal. On 12 December the Council again applied to the Circuit Court seeking to have the applicants imprisoned for failure to comply with the original orders. As this application was listed on 15 December, the High Court agreed to hear the applicants’ appeal against the refusal of a stay on 14 December.\n31: . On 13 December 2017 the Council offered the applicants emergency accommodation in an apartment, with secure parking where their caravans could be stored, but not accessible, subject to them vacating the Coonagh site.\n32: . On 14 December 2017, the High Court considered the appeal of the applicants, who were legally represented, against the Circuit Court’s refusal to suspend the orders. The applicants submitted further sworn statements describing their circumstances, their efforts to obtain housing and their grounds of appeal; they claimed that they had no other site to place their caravans and that the refusal to suspend the original orders deprived their substantive appeal of any meaning. Their lawyer claimed that the orders were disproportionate, that the Circuit Court had failed to assess proportionality under Article 8 of the Convention and that, as the orders had been made based solely on written rather than oral evidence, when the applicants had been unrepresented, they had been denied a fair hearing. Asked by the High Court to address how proportionality applied to the question of whether the applicants should remain on the Coonagh site, he argued that it went to the issue of whether alternative accommodation was made available to them. He repeated their reasons for refusing previous offers and described the latest offer as too late to be relevant.\n33: . In response, the Council set out the need for the development, the obstruction caused by the applicants’ illegal use of the site, and its efforts to provide accommodation. The Council argued that the applicants had not contested that their use of the site was illegal and stated that the contested orders would not result in them being made homeless, but their continued presence subjected the Council to enormous financial liability.\n34: . As to the Circuit Court’s refusal to adjourn the application to confirm if legal aid was available, the High Court, noting the significant delays in the Legal Aid Board making such decisions, and the prospect of the applicants unlawfully occupying the lands pending such a decision, stated that this decision was reasonable in the circumstances of the case.\n35: . In assessing the balance of convenience to the parties, the High Court first noted that the question of whether the original orders had been disproportionate had yet to be determined in the appeal, but suggested there was an equally strong argument they had been proportionate. The latter issue was assessed as follows: “As I say, it is not in dispute that the activities of the defendants are unlawful, and it seems to me that it was certainly within the discretion of the learned Circuit Court Judge to refuse a stay on the order of the injunction that he had granted. Particularly in circumstances where to have granted a stay would be effectively for him to reverse himself and entirely negative the effect of the injunction he had granted. So, the test I must apply is the one essential by way of assessing the balance of convenience. And it seems to me that there are a number of matters I must have regard to in considering where the balance of convenience lies in this matter. The first is that each of the defendants who are bringing this appeal have been offered accommodation by the local authority in circumstances where they may or may not find it satisfactory. But it is certainly not a case where the making of an order effectively renders these unfortunate people homeless for Christmas. There’s no question of that arising. One family, that’s the Faulkner family, have refused two offers of accommodation; perhaps with good reason, it’s not for me to decide. And the McDonaghs are apparently living in a hotel and occasionally perhaps daily visit their caravans on this particular site. But there’s no question of these people being turfed out on the side of the road without anywhere to go for Christmas as a result of this injunction having been granted in the Circuit Court. So, that’s the first matter I have to take account of. And, secondly, and importantly, is the fact that very substantial losses will accrue to the local authority; that’s not in dispute. If they’re not in a position to proceed with what is an essential work of important public interest in terms of the construction of a new ring road around the City of Limerick. I think I must also have regard to the fact that, I think I’m entitled to assume that the defendants will not be a mark for the undoubtedly huge damages that will occur to the local authority in the event that they are prevented from proceeding with their project. But I think most importantly, I have to have regard to the realities of when this appeal is going to get on. And as the parties may know from being in court today, dates are now being allocated for non-jury matters which include Circuit Court appeals of this nature towards the end of November 2018. So, in effect, if I grant a stay, that means that the Council would be entirely prevented from proceeding with their project for the best part of a year. So, what I would effectively be doing, it seems to me, is granting the defendants a veto over this project for as long as it takes for them to get the case on in this Court. I cannot see how that could possibly be regarded as being just to the plaintiffs in this case. As I say, there is no real issue about the unlawfulness of the activities that are carried on. And it seems to me that the balance of convenience lies overwhelmingly in favour of refusing this application for a stay in the circumstances I’ve outlined. So, I accordingly refuse the application.”\n36: . The judge refused to grant the applicants further time to comply with the original orders. Subsequent events\n37: . The applicants left the Coonagh site after the High Court decision and withdrew their substantive appeal. The High Court order stated that their appeal was being withdrawn, inter alia , because it was moot. The Council’s application for committal was adjourned indefinitely.\n38: . The first applicant’s family initially occupied a site in Limerick City’s Dock Road. After further enforcement action they moved to a third roadside site. They refused emergency accommodation on 8 January 2018. The first applicant stated that this was because the facility was too far from her children’s schools and it was unclear how long they could remain there. On 31 January 2018, they were offered a four-bedroom house at Caherdavin, which they accepted. Their tenancy did not commence until June 2018.\n39: . The second applicant’s family moved to the same site on the Dock Road and refused two offers of emergency accommodation in January 2018, the first a bed and breakfast, and the second a two-bedroom apartment. After being required to leave, they illegally occupied two further sites, leaving both after further enforcement action. In November 2018 they were approved for funding for private rental accommodation for a house in Limerick, at a level twenty per cent above the normal limit, where they remained. Relevant domestic law and practice Bunreacht na hÉireann (“the Constitution”)\n40: . Article 5 of the Constitution of Ireland provides as follows: “The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.” In Clare County Council v. Bernard McDonagh and Helen McDonagh , [2022] IESC 2, delivered on 31 January 2022, (hereafter the “ McDonagh judgment”) the Supreme Court examined an appeal relating to members of the Irish Traveller community and the granting of an interlocutory order under section 160 of the 2000 Act requiring them to move their mobile homes from land they were occupying illegally. As regards the applicability of Article 5 of the Constitution, it held that “it is sufficient that any person asserting the protection of Article 5 actually resides there” (see further below). The European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”)\n41: . Section 1 of the 2003 Act states: “(1) In this Act unless the context otherwise requires— [...] “organ of the State” includes a tribunal or any other body (other than the President ... or a court) which is established by law or through which any of the legislative, executive or judicial powers of the State are exercised;”\n42: . Section 2 of the 2003 Act states: “(1) In interpreting and applying any statutory provision or rule of law, a court shall, in so far as is possible, subject to the rules of law relating to such interpretation and application, do so in a manner compatible with the State’s obligations under the Convention provisions.”\n43: . Section 3 of the 2003 Act states: “(1) Subject to any statutory provision (other than this Act) or rule of law, every organ of the State shall perform its functions in a manner compatible with the State’s obligations under the Convention provisions. (2) A person who has suffered injury, loss or damage as a result of a contravention of subsection (1), may, if no other remedy in damages is available, institute proceedings to recover damages in respect of the contravention in the High Court (or, subject to subsection (3), in the Circuit Court) and the Court may award to the person such damages (if any) as it considers appropriate.” The Planning and Development Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”)\n44: . Section 2 of the 2000 Act defined “unauthorised development” as “the carrying out of any unauthorised works (including the construction, erection or making of any unauthorised structure) or the making of any unauthorised use.”\n45: . Section 3 of the 2000 Act defines a “development” as meaning “the making of any material change in use of any structures or other land” and states that when land becomes used for the purpose of “the placing or keeping of any vans, tents or other objects, whether or not moveable...for the purpose of caravanning or habitation” the use of the land shall be taken as having “materially changed”.\n46: . Section 160 of the 2000 Act states that when an unauthorised development is being carried out, the High Court or the Circuit Court may, on the application of a planning authority, require any person to do anything that the Court considers necessary to ensure that the unauthorised development is not carried out or continued. The application must be made by motion on notice to the defendants, who must be informed in detail beforehand of the action being taken (the relief sought, the affected land or development, the identity of the applicant and the date of the proposed application) and be copied with the statements sworn (affidavits) in support of the application (Order 56, rule 3 of the Circuit Court Rules). The Circuit Court may adjourn the hearing if a defendant has not been given notice. The defendant’s replying affidavits must be filed with the court within seven days of service of the notice of motion and served on the applicant. Relevant domestic case-law\n47: . In Wicklow County v. Fortune (No. 2) [2013] IEHC 255, the High Court (Hogan J.) refused to grant an order providing for the demolition of an unauthorised dwelling because the planning authority had not shown the dwelling was completely at odds with public policy objectives: “5. .. It is manifest from a series of decisions ... that the exercise of any such judicial power would also have to satisfy a proportionality test, not least given that the making of such an order would, at least, in the context of a case such as the present one significantly affect constitutional rights, not least the inviolability of the dwelling (Article 40.5) and the protection of property (Article 40.3.2). Of course, the proportionality at issue here is not simply proportionality in the narrow sense ... of whether the breach of the planning laws is so insignificant that the demolition of the property would represent an excessive response to such a technical infraction, but rather proportionality in a broader sense of that term, namely, the whether, in the circumstances of any given case, the policy objectives of legislative compliance and environmental protection can be said to justify such a far-reaching interference with property rights and the inviolability of the dwelling.”\n48: . In Meath County Council v. Murray [2017] IESC 25, the planning authority obtained a High Court order under section 160 of the 2000 Act requiring the demolition of a dwelling built without planning permission. The respondents appealed, arguing that the High Court, in exercising its discretion, had failed to apply the correct proportionality test and consider the consequences of the demolition for them. The Supreme Court (McKechnie J.) first considered whether the summary procedure involving affidavits under section 160 was inappropriate for certain types of cases: “35. I can see no reason in principle why the factual scaffolding of most cases cannot be adequately accommodated within the contours of the affidavit framework. Therefrom it should be readily apparent to all what area(s) of conflict, dispute or disagreement exist between the parties... If any such controversy touches upon issues of importance as to outcome, then the same can be explored by way of a viva voce examination. Indeed, if necessary, as the court has a constitutional obligation to ensure fairness and fair procedures, and as the superior courts have an inherent right to regulate their own procedures, they can be asked at any point to put in place a regime by which those objectives can best be served ... Subject to that, however, I do not see any overriding impediment or reason as to why s. 160 cannot be moved in all, or virtually all, cases where the infringement is alleged to be non-planning compliant. [...] 38. ... I believe that there is jurisdiction in all courts vested with authority to deal with s. 160 applications to regulate their own procedures – in the case of the Circuit Court within the relevant statutory provisions and the rules of court – so as to render that procedure compliant with constitutional norms.” The Supreme Court set out the factors that a court may consider in exercising its discretion under section 160 where an applicant has shown that an unauthorised development had taken place: “90. What, then, are the factors which play into the exercise of the court’s discretion? From a consideration of the case law, one can readily identify, inter alia, the following considerations: - (i) the nature of the breach: ranging from minor, technical, and inconsequential up to material, significant and gross; (ii) the conduct of the infringer: his attitude to planning control and his engagement or lack thereof with that process: - [...] (iii) the reason for the infringement: this may range from general mistake, through to indifference, and up to culpable disregard; (iv) the attitude of the planning authority: whilst important, this factor will not necessarily be decisive; (v) the public interest in upholding the integrity of the planning and development system; (vi) the public interest, such as: - • employment for those beyond the individual transgressors; or • the importance of the underlying structure/activity, for example, infrastructural facilities or services; (vii) the conduct and, if appropriate, personal circumstances of the applicant; (viii) the issue of delay, even within the statutory period, and of acquiescence; (ix) the personal circumstances of the respondent; and (x) the consequences of any such order, including the hardship and financial impact on the respondent and third parties. 93. The weight to be attributed to each factor will be determined by the circumstances of a given case. Some, because of their importance, may influence whether an order is or is not in fact made: others, the scope, nature or effect of that order. This list is not in any way intended to be exhaustive, and it may well be that other matters might require consideration in an appropriate case... However, the above list is generally representative of the type of factors which the judge will normally be called upon to consider. It is thus an appropriate framework within which to analyse the High Court’s exercise of discretion in this case...”\n49: . In finding against the respondents, McKechnie J. stated: “129.... [T]he fact of the unauthorised development being a family home will not of itself, in my view, be sufficient to persuade a court to exercise its discretion against demolition: important to that decision will be where the building has been constructed in such a deliberate and flagrant breach of the planning laws, as in both Wicklow County Council v. Fortune and here... I believe that Article 40.5 of the Constitution does not compel me to reach any different result, and that the conclusion so reached is consistent with the ECHR and with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights... I accordingly find that the test under s. 160 of the 2000 Act does not require to be recalibrated and that it was correctly applied by the trial judge in this case.”\n50: . McKechnie J concluded that all of the relevant factors, including the respondent’s connection with the area, their family circumstances, their integration into the local community and the fact that they had three school ‑ going children, had been properly considered. Finally he stated: “138. By the application of conventional principles, which is the correct approach, the decision of the judge could not be set aside on any of the grounds argued before this court. 139. This conclusion is entirely compatible with the Strasbourg jurisprudence, as Chapman v. United Kingdom (App. No. 27238/94) (2001) 33 E.H.R.R. 18 [in particular paragraph 102].”\n51: . In Waterford City & County Council v Centz Retail Holdings Ltd , [2020] IEHC 634, the High Court (Simons J.) explained: “53. ... As explained by the Supreme Court in Meath County Council v. Murray, the only precondition to the institution of proceedings [under section 160 of the 2000 Act] is that the local planning authority must have formed a bona fide opinion that unauthorised development is, has been or will be carried out. There is no requirement for a secondary decision, whereby the local planning authority must engage in a proportionality test. This is because the institution of proceedings does not per se determine any rights or liabilities. The proceedings are simply a vehicle to bring a complaint before the court. The ultimate decision to grant or refuse relief is a judicial function, and issues such as proportionality and urgency can be addressed by the court.”\n52: . The recent McDonagh judgment, cited above, involved a case with strong legal and factual similarities to the present applications. The Supreme Court (Hogan J) considered extensively the relevant provisions and principles of domestic law and of the Convention. The appellants in McDonagh , who were also members of the Travelling community, were in illegal occupation of land that belonged to the local authority, Clare County Council. Along with members of their extended family they had placed their caravans and mobile homes on the land. It was not in dispute that this was contrary to section 3 of the 2000 Act (see paragraph 45 above), being an unauthorised development within the meaning of that legislation. In August 2018 the Council applied to the High Court under section 160 of the 2000 Act seeking interlocutory orders compelling the McDonagh family to vacate the site immediately. The High Court granted the orders sought (on 25 July 2019), a decision that was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 12 November 2020.\n53: . The Supreme Court noted that the Court of Appeal had taken the view that, in light of the particular facts of the case, the appellants’ temporary dwellings did not constitute a “home” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention, and that it had not considered at all the relevant constitutional provision (Article 40.5, cited above). The Supreme Court emphasised the duty of the domestic courts, in proceedings that bear upon analogous provisions of the Constitution and the Convention, to properly consider and address the constitutional provision as well, rather than examining the case in light of the Convention only. It found that the appellants’ caravans attracted the protection of the Constitution as their “dwelling”. As for whether it was also their “home” within the meaning of the Convention, it considered that this was at least an arguable proposition, having regard to the relevant case ‑ law of the European Court. The result of the Court of Appeal’s negative conclusion on this point meant that it had not analysed the proportionality, as required by Article 8 of the Convention, of the orders granted against the appellants, beyond affirming that the actions of the Council were proportionate and fair. It was therefore for the Supreme Court to perform that analysis.\n54: . The central issue in the appeal was identified as the extent to which the constitutional protection of the appellants’ dwelling was diluted by the undisputed fact that they were trespassing on the Council’s property and flouting the planning laws. According to the relevant constitutional case-law, in particular the Murray case (cited above), where a dwelling has been constructed illegally, its protection under the Constitution would generally be greatly diluted and the general presumption would be very much in favour of the enforcement of the planning laws and the demolition of the building. Moreover, where the proceedings were brought by a private landowner seeking to recover possession of their land, their property rights under the Constitution and Protocol No. 1 to the Convention would have to be weighed in the balance too.\n55: . The Supreme Court then had regard to the case-law of the European Court, in particular to Winterstein and Others v. France , no. 27013/07, 17 October 2013. It observed that this precedent had not been considered in the Murray judgment and considered what difference this should make to the principles set out in the latter. It noted the different form of proceedings in the case before it compared to those decided domestically or at the European level, since it was an application for a mandatory interlocutory injunction. Such relief should only be granted where there are particularly strong and powerful reasons to do so. It should only be a stepping stone towards the trial of the merits of the case, not a means of obtaining summary judgment against the defendant. The Supreme Court further noted that, as clear from Winterstein and Others , a court must conduct a proportionality analysis before making the order sought. It considered that in one respect the approach laid out in Murray should be “re-calibrated slightly”, referring to the extent to which a court should defer to the role and judgment of the planning authorities. Therefore, as stated in Winterstein and Others , a court considering an application under section 160 of the 2000 Act must make its own independent judgment on the proportionality of the order requested. It was therefore not necessary to determine whether local authorities were themselves under an obligation to conduct a proportionality analysis prior to bringing proceedings.\n56: . The Supreme Court identified two particular features of the case that merited consideration. The first was the fact that the appellants formed part of a vulnerable minority in Ireland. The second was that while the local authority had brought the proceedings in its capacity as landowner and planning authority, it also had, in its capacity as a housing authority, a specific statutory duty to offer suitable accommodation to the appellants, a duty in which it had arguably failed. That was a point to address at a later stage.\n57: . Since the object of the proceedings was to obtain an interlocutory injunction, the question was whether the appellants had raised an arguable case by way of defence. The Supreme Court considered that they had, setting out the ten considerations drawn from the circumstances of the case that led it to this position (see paragraphs 106-117 of the judgment). It came to the conclusion that, at that particular juncture, the balance of convenience did not lie in favour of granting the injunction, bearing in mind the marginalised status of the appellants. Ordering them to leave the site would make them homeless with nowhere else they could lawfully go. If that were to change, however, the question of interlocutory orders might be considered differently. The Supreme Court further observed that in the present case, unlike in Murray and other domestic cases, the unlawful occupation of the land did not pose any obvious and immediate threat to the amenities of third parties or raise particular environmental concerns. Also weighing heavily against granting the injunction at that particular juncture, was the at least arguable case that the Council had not fulfilled its statutory duty to offer suitable accommodation to the appellants.\n58: . The appeal was allowed, and the mandatory orders granted were discharged. Relevant international law materials The Revised European Social Charter\n59: . Ireland ratified the Revised European Social Charter on 4 November 2000 but has not yet ratified Article 31 (“the right to housing”). Article 16 states: Article 16 – The right of the family to social, legal and economic protection “With a view to ensuring the necessary conditions for the full development of the family, which is a fundamental unit of society, the Parties undertake to promote the economic, legal and social protection of family life by such means as social and family benefits, fiscal arrangements, provision of family housing, benefits for the newly married and other appropriate means.” In European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) v. Ireland (Complaint No. 100/2013, decision on the merits of 1 December 2015) the ERRC made a complaint to the European Committee of Social Rights (ECSR) alleging both that specific legislative provisions for evictions in Ireland and the inadequate provision of sufficient Traveller accommodation breached Article 16. The ECSR found that both the insufficient provision of accommodation for Travellers and the inadequate conditions of the available accommodation were in violation of Article 16 of the Charter. The ECSR also examined complaints concerning the Planning and Development Act 2000 but found no violation of Article 16. It found that other legislation, in failing to provide for prior consultation, adequate notice or proposals for alternative accommodation before eviction, was in breach of Article 16. Recommendation 2005(4) of the Committee of Ministers to member states on improving the housing conditions of Roma and Travellers in Europe\n60: . The Recommendation provides, as relevant: “Legal protection from unlawful evictions and the procedure for legal evictions 26. ...In the case of lawful evictions, Roma must be provided with appropriate alternative accommodation, if needed, except in cases of force majeure. Legislation should also strictly define the procedures for legal eviction, and such legislation should comply with international human rights standards and principles, including those articulated in General Comment No. 7 on forced evictions of the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural rights. Such measures shall include consultation with the community or individual concerned, reasonable notice, provision of information, a guarantee that the eviction will be carried out in a reasonable manner, effective legal remedies and free or low cost legal assistance for the persons concerned. The alternative housing should not result in further segregation.” The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI)\n61: . In its report on Ireland (fifth monitoring cycle), adopted on 2 April 2019, ECRI examined the issue of Traveller accommodation [1] . It recommended that the authorities step up efforts to meet the accommodation needs of Travellers and that a solution be found to the issue of failure by local authorities to use the funding allocated for Traveller accommodation. In an interim follow-up by ECRI in relation to the second recommendation on 3 March 2022 [2] , it found that “despite some encouraging developments, its recommendation has not yet been implemented”. COMPLAINTS\n62: . The applicants claim that the orders requiring them to remove their caravans from the Coonagh site constituted an interference with their right to respect for their home under Article 8 § 1, and that neither the Council nor the domestic courts carried out any examination of the proportionality of the interference in accordance with the requirements of Article 8 § 2.\n63: . The applicants further claim that the domestic proceedings breached Article 6 of the Convention as they were conducted in undue haste and they were not legally represented. THE LAW Joinder of the applications\n64: . Having regard to the similar subject matter of the applications, the Court finds it appropriate to examine them jointly (Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Alleged violation of Article 8 of the Convention\n65: . The applicants claimed that the orders requiring them to vacate the site which they were illegally occupying constituted an interference with their right to respect for their home under Article 8 of the Convention, and that the domestic authorities had not carried out an examination of the proportionality of that interference in accordance with the requirements of Article 8 § 2. Article 8 provides, as relevant: “1. Everyone has the right to respect for ... his home.... 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\n66: . Relying on Article 6 of the Convention, the applicants further complained that the domestic proceedings had been conducted in undue haste and that they had not been legally represented at the Circuit Court hearing at which the eviction orders were originally made.\n67: . The Court considers it appropriate to examine the complaints raised by the applicants from the perspective of Article 8 of the Convention alone, which requires that the decision-making process leading to measures of interference be fair and that it respect the interests protected by this provision (see Connors v. the United Kingdom , no. 66746/01, § 83, 27 May 2004). The parties’ submissions (a) The Government\n68: . The Government raised two objections to the admissibility of the case. Firstly, referring to Rule 47 § 3.1(a) and 47 § 6(a) of the Rules of Court, they argued that the applicants had failed to provide a complete application within the six-month period as they had not provided copies of the transcripts of the domestic hearings with their original applications. As the domestic courts had not given written judgments and there had been no stenographer present, the applicants should have sought copies of the Digital Audio Record (DAR) promptly so that they could prepare transcripts to accompany their applications. An expedited procedure was available for such applications in these circumstances. The applicants had failed to provide either an adequate explanation for this failure, or any reason why a different date should be considered as the date of introduction in accordance with Rule 47 § 6(b) of the Rules of Court.\n69: . Secondly, the Government argued that the applicants had failed to exhaust domestic remedies, as they had withdrawn their High Court appeal before it could be heard (see paragraph 37 above). They should have maintained that appeal, which would have led to a de novo hearing in the High Court at which they could have developed their arguments as to the question of proportionality, with the prospect of adequate redress for their complaint.\n70: . On the merits of the case, the Government accepted that there had been an interference with the applicants’ “home”, within the meaning of Article 8. However, they considered that the justification for that interference – its necessity and proportionality in all of the circumstances of the case – had been adequately examined by the domestic courts, in keeping with the procedural requirements set down in the Court’s case-law. On the key question of alternative accommodation, the parties had had the possibility to make their submissions and these had been taken into account at each level of jurisdiction, both in the granting of the orders sought and in the decision not to stay their enforcement.\n71: . The Government considered that the proceedings had been fair, and that it had not been inappropriate for the Circuit Court to proceed at a time when the applicants had yet to obtain legal representation. Under domestic law, where a party to proceedings is unrepresented, the court must exercise due diligence having regard to the absence of legal representation; the Circuit Court had done this. The issue of legal representation had been resolved relatively quickly in any event. Although the applicants criticised the expedited nature of the proceedings before the Circuit Court, the Government considered that this had been justified by the considerable consequences, in terms of personal safety and financial penalties for the Council, of their continuing occupation of the site at that time. They explained that the section 160 procedure was by its nature a summary one, conducted on the basis of affidavits and intended to ensure the prompt enforcement of planning controls.\n72: . In any event, even were the Court to take the view that the proceedings had not afforded the required procedural safeguards to the applicants and to proceed to its own assessment of the interference, the Government maintained that the order to leave the site could not be regarded as an unjustified or disproportionate interference with the applicants’ rights under Article 8, given the illegal nature of their presence there and the above ‑ mentioned negative consequences of this. (b) The applicants\n73: . The applicants claimed variously that they had provided a complete application within six months in compliance with the relevant provisions of Rule 47, that a different date should be considered the date of introduction in accordance with Rule 47 § 6 (b), and that, in any event, if they had failed to provide a complete application within the six-month period they had provided an adequate explanation in accordance with Rule 47 § 5.1(a) of the Rules of Court.\n74: . The applicants explained, providing relevant details and dates, the expensive and time-consuming process for obtaining copies of the DAR, which required a formal application to the courts, and then the production of their own transcripts. They submitted that the statutory provision preventing the Legal Aid Board from representing them in the proceedings, which led to them seeking legal representation from FLAC, and the absence of reasoned written judgments or of a timely and inexpensive system for obtaining transcripts, were failures of the domestic legal system. The Government should not be allowed to rely on these to argue that the applications were inadmissible. To impose a requirement of this nature could render it very difficult for many other potential applicants to comply with the six-month rule.\n75: . In response to the Government’s claim that they had failed to exhaust domestic remedies, the applicants argued that if the applicable law permitted orders to be made requiring them to leave the site and denying them a stay pending their appeal, then it was deficient per se , even had an appeal been possible. As they could not return to the site, they claimed that their appeal was moot and, under Irish law, could not have continued to hearing. They contested the Government’s claims that they were entitled to a de novo hearing, even had their substantive appeal proceeded; they maintained that the applicable legislation meant that no new evidence would ordinarily be admissible in such an appeal. Moreover, even if that appeal had been heard, it was unclear what remedy the High Court could have provided. They argued that as they had faced possible imprisonment in case of failure to comply with the orders, in the absence of a stay an appeal could not be an effective remedy.\n76: . On the merits of their complaint, the applicants accepted that their occupation of the Coonagh site had been unauthorised but argued, referring to Winterstein and Others , cited above, §§ 141-142, that they had had sufficient links with the site for it to be considered their “home” under Article 8 § 1 of the Convention (see paragraphs 7-8 above). They claimed that the orders requiring them to leave the site were an interference with their right to respect for their home under Article 8 § 1 of the Convention and that the domestic authorities had failed to assess the proportionality of that interference. To begin with, the Council had not taken account of the fact that the site was their “home” within the meaning of Article 8, nor had it given any consideration to the proportionality of the orders it was seeking from the Circuit Court. By failing to require such an assessment by the local authority, Irish law was deficient in this regard.\n77: . As to whether section 160 of the 2000 Act allowed the proportionality of that interference to be assessed, they noted that that provision did not expressly mandate such an assessment, but accepted that a limited assessment was possible, having regard both to domestic case ‑ law and the obligation imposed on the domestic courts under the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 Act (see paragraphs 42 and 47-51 above). However, they claimed that the scope of the courts’ discretion had not been established for persons in their position, occupying caravans.\n78: . The applicants argued that they had remained on the site because they had had nowhere else to place their caravans, that the urgent necessity for their removal had arisen due to the Council’s failure to provide alternatives, that there had been no viable offer of accommodation between June 2017 and their eviction, and that the contractual penalties and other grounds put forward by the Council to justify the orders had resulted from these failures.\n79: . In their view, the Circuit Court had not critically examined the Council’s submissions, engaged with the considerations set down in domestic case-law, or considered the proportionality of the alleged interference before making the original orders on 30 November 2017. They claimed that later hearings had addressed only the application for a stay of those orders and had not sufficiently considered their proportionality. Any proportionality assessment should have considered the conditions in which the eviction was to be effected, in particular the arrangements for alternative accommodation.\n80: . The applicants submitted that they were from a vulnerable minority, of limited education and unable to pay for legal representation. Because of the adversarial nature of the proceedings, the complexity of the subject matter, and the hearing of evidence on affidavit, the preparation of which required legal assistance, the application on 30 November 2017 had proceeded on the basis of the Council’s evidence and submissions, and they had been unable to effectively participate. They claimed that the expedited nature of that first stage of the domestic proceedings had prevented them from obtaining legal representation and putting evidence on affidavit before orders were made.\n81: . Referring to Winterstein and Others , cited above, §§ 159-160, the applicants argued that the State had a positive obligation to provide them with housing, and that, as they belonged to a vulnerable minority, the State should have given special consideration to their needs and their different lifestyle in assessing the proportionality of the orders and deciding on the timing and manner of their removal. They argued that this extended to the provision of resources to allow them to effectively defend their rights. (c) The third parties\n82: . The Traveller Equality and Justice Project (TEJP), the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHREC) and the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) provided submissions. All three parties claimed that local authorities were failing to provide an adequate volume of accommodation in compliance with their obligations under domestic legislation and they criticised the inadequate and insanitary conditions of existing accommodation as well as the inadequate provision of basic services. The TEJP claimed that this shortage of Traveller-specific accommodation meant that requiring Travellers to vacate a site could amount to the practical destruction of their home.\n83: . The ERRC claimed that the State was failing to adequately address the problem of racism against Travellers in Ireland. The IHREC described the high rates of infant mortality, homelessness and unemployment among the Traveller community, their lower life expectancy, low levels of education, inadequate access to public services and evidence of discrimination in access to housing.\n84: . The TEJP, referring to the domestic case-law on section 160 of the 2000 Act, argued that while the Irish courts recognised the need for an assessment of proportionality, they struggled to balance the right to a home against competing interests in the context of Travellers, whose “home” was not a traditional one. The IHREC criticised the fact that the legislation does not mandate a proportionality assessment, claimed that local authorities were not required to assess proportionality before seeking orders (see paragraph 46 above) and claimed that the extent to which Irish courts could properly assess proportionality under section 160 was unclear.\n85: . The IHREC criticised delays in access to legal aid and the absence of a dedicated system for persons faced with eviction, particularly Travellers, given their status as a vulnerable minority. It criticised the use of expedited proceedings, which led to orders being made before legal representation could be obtained. The Court’s assessment (a) The Government’s objections\n86: . Regarding the Government’s argument that the application should be regarded as out of time, the Court notes that the applicants lodged their applications on 14 June 2018, that is to say within six months of the final domestic decision, which was given on 14 December 2017. They were instructed by the Registry to provide certain additional elements, including transcripts, in order to complete the file before its examination was commenced. In the course of further correspondence, additional time was allowed for the applicants to submit all of the relevant transcripts. This was eventually done by 27 March 2019. The applicants have explained their limited resources, the need to obtain new legal representation after the proceedings ended, the absence of published judgments or official transcripts, and the procedure required to obtain the latter. The Court sees no reason to reconsider the acceptance of the applications which was based on the fact that the applicants had provided an adequate explanation (Rule 47 § 5.1 (a)) for why they did not initially comply with Rule 47 § 3.1 (a). It follows that 14 June 2018 is to be considered as the date of the introduction of the application (Rule 47 § 6(b)) and that, therefore, the Government’s objection regarding the six months’ time limit, raised under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (as it stood at the relevant time), must be rejected.\n87: . As to the exhaustion of domestic remedies, the Court would observe, first, that the submissions in this case were made some time before the Supreme Court delivered its McDonagh judgment, and therefore referred to the domestic case-law relating to section 160 of the 2000 Act as it stood at that time. What the McDonagh proceedings confirm is that for a case such as the present one, i.e. in which a local authority seeks interlocutory orders compelling members of the Traveller community to vacate an illegally occupied site, a remedy is available before the domestic courts. As held by the Supreme Court, in such circumstances an application by a local authority cannot be granted without a formal proportionality analysis by the competent court. In so holding, the Supreme Court paid close attention to the principles set down in the case-law of this Court, and the thoroughness with which the Supreme Court itself examined the proportionality of the requested orders speaks strongly for the effectiveness of that remedy.\n88: . In light of this, it might be considered that Government’s objection under Article 35 § 1 should be accepted, bearing in mind that the applicants, in contrast to the appellants in McDonagh , took their case no further than the High Court, and even then only in the form of an appeal against the Circuit Court’s refusal to stay the implementation of the orders requiring the applicants to leave the site in question. Following the High Court’s decision on that appeal, their appeal against the orders as such was not pursued.\n89: . The Court recalls here that the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies is a fundamental feature of the convention system, and refers to the well-established principles of its case-law in this respect (see O’Sullivan McCarthy Mussel Development Ltd v. Ireland , no. 44460/16, § 79, 7 June 2018, with further references). States are exempted from answering before an international body for their acts until they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. Those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies therefore requires applicants to make normal use of remedies which are available and sufficient in respect of their Convention grievances.\n90: . In the present case, the Court considers that the question whether or not the applicants sufficiently exhausted domestic remedies can be left open since, for the reasons set out at some length below, it finds that the case must in any event be rejected as inadmissible. (b) Whether there was an interference with the applicants’ “home”\n91: . The Court observes that whether or not a particular premises constitutes a “home” – an autonomous concept under the Convention – and thus attracts the protection of Article 8 § 1 will depend on the existence of sufficient and continuous links with a specific place (see, among others, Winterstein and Others , cited above, § 141). Furthermore, whether a property is to be classified as a “home” is a question of fact and does not depend on the lawfulness of the occupation under domestic law (see Hirtu and Others v. France , no. 24720/13, § 65, 14 May 2020 and the authorities cited therein). At the time of their departure in 2017, both applicants and their families had been living on the Coonagh site for over four years and their children had been enrolled in local schools. The Court thus considers in light of the circumstances of this case that the Coonagh site can be viewed as the site of the applicants’ home at the relevant time. Accordingly, and the Government did not dispute this, the orders requiring the applicants to vacate the site constituted an interference with their right to respect for their home. (c) Whether the interference was “in accordance with the law”\n92: . The Council’s application was made under section 160 of the 2000 Act and the relevant Circuit Court Rules, which provide for the court to grant the relevant orders where an unauthorised development has been carried out. The applicants did not contest that their use of the site was unauthorised. The Court is satisfied that the application of these provisions was sufficiently clear and foreseeable and that the impugned measure was “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. The criticisms made by the applicants and the third parties of the domestic legal framework will be considered under sub-section (e) below. (d) Whether the interference pursued a “legitimate aim”\n93: . The Court accepts, as argued by the Government, that the orders pursued the legitimate aims of public safety, in the sense of ensuring the personal safety of all those present on the site, and the economic well-being of the country through the improvement of the road network. (e) Whether the interference was proportionate to the legitimate aims (i) Relevant general principles\n94: . An interference will be considered “necessary in a democratic society” for a legitimate aim if it answers a “pressing social need” and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of necessity, the final evaluation as to whether the reasons cited for the interference are relevant and sufficient remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Winterstein and Others , cited above, § 147, Yordanova and Others , cited above, § 117, and Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], cited above, § 90).\n95: . A margin of appreciation must be left to the national authorities who, by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right at issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The following points emerge from the Court’s case-law (see Yordanova , cited above, § 118 (i)-(iv), with further references): (i) In spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, including housing, the Court affords the authorities considerable latitude. The Court has found that “[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation”. (ii) On the other hand, the margin of appreciation left to the authorities will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual’s effective enjoyment of fundamental or “intimate” rights. This is the case in particular for Article 8 rights, which are rights of central importance to the individual’s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community. (iii) The procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8. The “necessary in a democratic society” requirement under Article 8 § 2 raises a question of procedure as well of substance. (iv) Since the loss of one’s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right under Article 8 to respect for one’s home, any person at risk of being a victim thereof should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8 of the Convention, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, he has no right of occupation. This means, among other things, that where relevant arguments concerning the proportionality of the interference have been raised by the applicant in domestic judicial proceedings, the domestic courts should examine them in detail and provide adequate reasons (see also, in this regard, Winterstein and Others , cited above, § 76).\n96: . In considering whether an eviction is proportionate, the Court will take account of whether the home was lawfully established. If the home was lawfully established this factor will weigh against the legitimacy of requiring the individual to move. Conversely, if the home was established unlawfully, the position of the individual is less strong. If no alternative accommodation is available, the interference is more serious than where such accommodation is available. The more suitable the alternative accommodation is, the less serious is the interference constituted by moving the applicant from his or her existing accommodation. The evaluation of the suitability of alternative accommodation is a task that will involve consideration of the situation and particular needs of the persons concerned as well as the needs, rights and interests of the local community. In respect of this task it is appropriate to give a wide margin of appreciation to national authorities who are evidently better placed to make the requisite assessment (see Chapman , cited above, §§ 102-104).\n97: . The Court has stated that although the fact of belonging to a minority with a traditional lifestyle different from that of the majority does not confer an immunity from general laws intended to safeguard the assets of the community as a whole, it may have an incidence on the manner in which such laws are to be implemented. The vulnerable position of Roma and Travellers as a minority means that some special consideration must be given to their needs and their different lifestyle both in the relevant regulatory planning framework and in reaching decisions in particular cases (see Chapman , cited above, § 96; Connors , cited above, § 84, and Hirtu and Others , cited above, § 70). To this extent, there is thus a positive obligation imposed on the Contracting States by virtue of Article 8 to facilitate the way of life of the Roma and Travellers (see Chapman , § 96).\n98: . The Court would recall, however, the limits it has identified in its case-law on the scope of Article 8 of the Convention. It has held that this provision does not recognise, as such, a right to be provided with a home (see Ghailan and Others v. Spain , no. 36366/14, § 53, 23 March 2021, and further references therein), nor does it confer a right to live in a particular location (see Garib v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 43494/09, § 141, 6 November 2017, and further references therein), or guarantee the right to have one’s housing problems solved by the authorities, as the scope of any positive obligation to house the homeless is limited (see Hudorovič and Others v. Slovenia , nos. 24816/14 and 25140/14, § 114, 10 March 2020). (ii) Application to the present case\n99: . The Court will first consider the arguments of the applicants, supported by the third parties, regarding the domestic legal framework as such. The criticism was made that section 160 does not require local authorities to make their own assessment of the proportionality, in terms of Article 8, of the measures sought when they apply to the courts under this provision. However, as the domestic courts have clearly stated, an application is merely a vehicle to bring a complaint before the courts; it does not in itself determine rights or liabilities. It falls to the competent domestic court to examine whether there has been a breach of the planning laws and then, having regard to the non-exhaustive list of considerations identified in domestic law, to decide whether or not to exercise its discretion to grant orders (see paragraphs 51 and 55 above). The decision to grant or refuse relief is a judicial function and the courts are under a general obligation, by virtue of Section 2 of the 2003 Act, to interpret domestic law, insofar as is possible, in accordance with the Convention (see paragraph 42 above). A person at risk of losing their home on account of proceedings brought under this statutory provision must be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined judicially, in keeping with the requirements of Article 8. Accordingly, the Court does not consider this specific criticism to be justified.\n100: . It was also argued that when it came to Travellers residing in caravans and occupying sites illegally, the scope of the domestic courts’ discretion had not been clearly established, that in the absence of a clear statutory mandate to assess proportionality the extent to which the courts could do so properly under section 160 remained unclear, and that in practice the courts struggled to do so when proceedings are brought against Travellers with non-traditional “homes”. The Court notes that the domestic case-law which has been drawn to its attention by the parties derives from cases involving illicitly constructed dwellings, rather than, as here, the illicit occupation by caravans of a site owned by the local authority. However, it is clear that some of the factors enumerated by the Supreme Court in the Murray judgment are relevant to a situation such as that of the applicants (see paragraph 48 above). In that judgment the Supreme Court indicated the need to apply Convention principles and referred to relevant case-law of this Court, namely the Chapman case (at paragraph 49 above). The effect of section 2 of the 2003 Act can be noted here too. The Court is therefore not persuaded by the criticisms that have been levelled against the domestic law as such. Indeed, the Court notes that the domestic case-law relied on by the respondent State in its written submissions is precisely that relied on by the Supreme Court in its recent McDonagh judgment, cited above, where, referring in detail to the case-law of this Court on Article 8, the Supreme Court confirmed the need, in a case involving section 160 of the 2000 Act and illegal occupation of local authority land, for a formal proportionality assessment regarding the objective necessity for making the orders sought by the council.\n101: . The Court must next consider whether the applicants benefitted from sufficient procedural safeguards and whether the decision-making process followed in this case was fair and such as to afford due respect to their rights under Article 8. The applicants complained that the expedited nature of the proceedings and the lack of legal representation in the hearing of 30 November 2017, when the orders were first made, prevented them from making relevant arguments, submitting evidence, or effectively participating, and that the limited remit of the later hearings meant that these deficiencies were not remedied. The Government maintained that the Circuit Court judge was mindful of the disadvantage faced by the applicants on that date. The Court acknowledges that the applicants were directly heard in court on that occasion and so were able to explain to the judge their disadvantaged personal circumstances. Nevertheless, it is difficult for the Court to accept that, lacking legal representation, the applicants were in a position to participate effectively in that first phase of proceedings, which relied on sworn written statements as evidence and were adversarial in nature. As the Court has stated previously (see paragraph 97 above), the marginalised status or vulnerable nature of the party opposing the prospective interference with their “home” cannot be overlooked.\n102: . Furthermore, based on the transcript of that hearing, it does not appear that the Circuit Court explicitly assessed the proportionality of the orders being sought. In particular, while the Council advanced its reasons for seeking the applicants’ removal and presented evidence of previous offers of accommodation, there is no sign that the question of whether any alternative accommodation was available at that point in time was actually considered. In this respect too, based on the material available to it, the Court has considerable doubts about whether the applicants benefitted from a key procedural safeguard, namely the taking into account of all aspects going to the proportionality of the interference with their right to respect for their homes, when the matter was first brought before the Circuit Court.\n103: . However, in determining whether the required proportionality assessment was in fact undertaken at domestic level, and whether the proceedings were fair overall, the Court considers that it can examine them in their entirety (by analogy with Article 6; see, among many other authorities, Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 197, ECHR 2012). The disadvantage to the applicants due to the initial lack of legal representation was almost immediately overcome when they were granted legal aid some days later. They were then in a position to effectively assert their interests in the proceedings that followed before the Circuit Court again (application to stay enforcement of the orders) and then before the High Court. As indicated above, the Circuit Court refused to grant a stay on 6 December 2017, but it did allow some additional time for the applicants to leave the site. It was the applicants’ appeal against the refusal of a stay that was subsequently heard in the High Court on 14 December 2017.\n104: . It is true that the scope of these proceedings was somewhat narrow, since the High Court was called on to examine the manner and timing of the applicant’s departure from the site, rather than the justification for it, which would have been for further proceedings to determine had the applicants not withdrawn their substantive appeal. However, the Court considers that the key point at issue between the parties on that date was precisely whether the factors relied on by the local authority to seek their immediate departure from the site should prevail over the interests of the applicants in being allowed more time to find, or to be allocated, suitable alternative accommodation. It was from this angle that the applicants’ counsel made submissions on proportionality at the High Court hearing.\n105: . The Court can therefore accept that the scope of the proceedings before the High Court was not inadequate. It was open to that court to make its own assessment whether, given all of the circumstances and in light of the submissions made on behalf of the applicants, it would be justified to postpone the enforcement of the orders granted by the Circuit Court.\n106: . The judge reached his decision on that issue by means of a balancing exercise. Admittedly, given the nature of those proceedings, it was not as detailed as it would have been had the applicants pursued their case on the merits. However, the Court notes that the High Court sought to establish where the balance of convenience lay in relation to the enforcement of the orders. The essential interests in play were identified, that is to say the applicants’ prospects as they stood on that date for alternative accommodation, the substantial losses that would accrue to the local authority from the delay, and the other important public interest in the improvement of the local road system. The judge also reckoned with, and gave weight to, the significant period of time that would elapse, realistically, before the applicants’ appeal against the merits of the orders could be heard and the inevitable repercussions this would have on the new road scheme. From all the different factors just listed, and from the unlawful character of the applicants’ occupation of the site, he concluded that the balance of convenience was against them.\n107: . It is true that the applicants did not in the end obtain a full and substantive review of the orders granted by the Circuit Court. However, the Court cannot lose sight of the fact that this was because the appeal they lodged against these orders was ultimately not pursued. The Court has expressed misgivings, though, about the first hearing before the Circuit Court, judged against the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention, misgivings which are amplified in the light of the Supreme Court’s approach in McDonagh , cited above. Where the procedural safeguards formally available to applicants are weakened in practice, the relatively broad margin of appreciation open to States in cases of this nature may be reduced (see paragraph 95(iii) above). However, in view of the facts of this case (assessed below), and given that the proportionality of the interference was examined judicially, the Court does not consider that it should draw, on this basis alone, a negative inference regarding whether the respondent State remained within its margin of appreciation.\n108: . This brings the Court to the last stage in its analysis, where it must make the final evaluation of the conformity of the measures taken in relation to the applicants with the requirements of the Convention (see paragraph 94 above). It would clarify that it is not its task to sit in appeal on the merits of the orders obtained by the Council, or on the decision taken by the High Court (see Chapman , cited above, § 114). Rather, it must verify whether it can be said that the domestic authorities acted within their margin of appreciation.\n109: . Having regard to its case-law (see paragraph 95(i) and (ii) above), the Court first notes that the interference arose in the context of road works, the importance of which for the local community was affirmed by the domestic courts as well as by the Government in the present proceedings. This clearly pertains to the sphere of social and economic policy, indicating that, as a point of departure at least, a broader margin of appreciation should be allowed. In addition, the Council’s intervention had also been dictated by considerations of public safety, both for the children and adults living on the Coonagh site and the construction workers seeking to carry out their tasks without harming either.\n110: . Furthermore, a key issue in the consideration of the case before the domestic courts was whether suitable alternative accommodation was available to the applicants and their families. As this necessarily bore upon the resources, both physical and financial, available to the local authority, and as the allocation of such resources also pertains to the sphere of the respondent State’s social policy affecting many claimants, this too indicates that a broader margin of appreciation should generally be allowed.\n111: . The implications for the applicants’ enjoyment of their protected rights must also be taken into account. Here the Court would observe that the applicants’ occupation of the site was unlawful. While it has accepted that it was their “home” for the purpose of triggering the protection of Article 8, it has held in its case-law that where a home is unlawfully established, the person’s position is less strong (see paragraph 96, above). Moreover, the applicants have not argued that they should have been permitted to remain indefinitely on the site; their complaint relates to the difficulties caused to them when they were required to move on at short notice in the absence, in their view, of satisfactory alternative accommodation.\n112: . The Court takes note of the critical remarks made by the three intervening parties in this case regarding the adequacy of accommodation or sites made available to the Traveller community, despite the statutory duties on local authorities in Ireland in this regard. The well-documented disadvantages suffered by the members of this social group have been referred to, as have continued concerns about persistent shortcomings in meeting their housing needs (see paragraphs 59 and 61 above). As stated previously, in its case-law the Court has recognised the vulnerable position in society of Roma and Travellers and has recognised the need for national authorities to give special consideration to their needs and different lifestyle (see paragraph 97 above). In this respect, the efforts made by the local authority to secure alternative accommodation for the applicants are to be taken into account. These efforts preceded the events at issue in the case, although the parties have offered divergent assessments of them. They continued during the domestic proceedings, it being indicated to the High Court that emergency accommodation was available, so that the applicants were not facing a situation of homelessness in mid-winter. The efforts continued after the proceedings as well, with further offers of emergency accommodation the following month, that were not accepted, and eventually a solution for each family that saw them in new accommodation in, respectively, July and November of 2018.\n113: . The Court would clarify that it is not its task in these proceedings to determine the nature and extent of a local authority’s duty under Irish law to provide accommodation, or whether the local authority fulfilled its duty in this respect towards the applicants. Bearing in mind the limits to the scope of Article 8 when it comes to the provision of accommodation (see the cases referred to at paragraph 98 above), the Court’s competence is limited to ruling on the compliance by the respondent State, having regard to the actions of the local authority and the judicial authorities, with the requirements of Article 8 as they arose on the facts of this particular case.\n114: . In conclusion, in light of the material provided to it, the Court has no basis to regard the means employed to achieve the legitimate aims pursued as disproportionate to those aims. It can therefore be accepted that, with respect to the complained of interference with the applicants’ rights, the authorities of the respondent State remained within their margin of appreciation.\n115: Regard being had to the above, the Court finds that the facts of the case disclose no appearance of a violation of Article 8. The application is accordingly inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article\n \n35\n \n§§\n \n3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.\nFor these reasons, the Court, unanimously,\nDecides\n to join the applications;\nDeclares\n the applications inadmissible.\nDone in English and notified in writing on 31 March 2022.\n \n \nVictor Soloveytchik\n \nMārtiņš Mits\n \nRegistrar\n \nPresident\n[1]\n \nCRI(2019)18.\n[2]\n \nCRI(2022)02."

Judicial-review procedure is not well-adapted for the resolution of sensitive factual questions which are better left to the County Court responsible for ordering possession.

            "001-86233\n39: The Government contended that any interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 8 § 1 was justified within the meaning of Article 8 § 2. The local authority’s decisions to procure a notice to quit from his wife and subsequently to commence possession proceedings were taken in accordance with the law and pursued a number of legitimate aims, namely (a) the protection of the rights of the authority as owner of the property with responsibility for the management of its social housing stock; (b) the protection of the rights and freedoms of others on the authority’s waiting list to be provided with housing out of the authority’s stock of homes to meet their needs; and (c) the promotion of the economic wellbeing of the country. Furthermore, given that it was necessary in a democracy to have in place clear and certain rules governing property rights, and in view of the fact that under ordinary property law the authority had an absolute right to recover the property in question, the Government submitted that the interference which arose by virtue of the recognition and implementation of those rights by the courts was “necessary in a democratic society” and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",
            "001-86233\n49: The central question in this case is, therefore, whether the interference was proportionate to the aim pursued and thus “necessary in a democratic society”. It must be noted that this requirement under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention raises a question of procedure as well as one of substance. The Court set out the relevant principles in assessing the necessity of an interference with the right to “home” by the application of summary possession proceedings in the case of Connors (cited above, §§ 81-84), which was decided subsequent to the House of Lords’ judgment in Qazi (see paragraphs 22-25 above), but before its decision in Kay (see paragraphs 26-28 above), as follows:",
            "001-216764\n99. The Court will first consider the arguments of the applicants, supported by the third parties, regarding the domestic legal framework as such. The criticism was made that section 160 does not require local authorities to make their own assessment of the proportionality, in terms of Article 8, of the measures sought when they apply to the courts under this provision. However, as the domestic courts have clearly stated, an application is merely a vehicle to bring a complaint before the courts; it does not in itself determine rights or liabilities. It falls to the competent domestic court to examine whether there has been a breach of the planning laws and then, having regard to the non-exhaustive list of considerations identified in domestic law, to decide whether or not to exercise its discretion to grant orders (see paragraphs 51 and 55 above). The decision to grant or refuse relief is a judicial function and the courts are under a general obligation, by virtue of Section 2 of the 2003 Act, to interpret domestic law, insofar as is possible, in accordance with the Convention (see paragraph 42 above). A person at risk of losing their home on account of proceedings brought under this statutory provision must be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined judicially, in keeping with the requirements of Article 8. Accordingly, the Court does not consider this specific criticism to be justified.",
            "001-216764\n102. Furthermore, based on the transcript of that hearing, it does not appear that the Circuit Court explicitly assessed the proportionality of the orders being sought. In particular, while the Council advanced its reasons for seeking the applicants’ removal and presented evidence of previous offers of accommodation, there is no sign that the question of whether any alternative accommodation was available at that point in time was actually considered. In this respect too, based on the material available to it, the Court has considerable doubts about whether the applicants benefitted from a key procedural safeguard, namely the taking into account of all aspects going to the proportionality of the interference with their right to respect for their homes, when the matter was first brought before the Circuit Court.",
            "001-86233\n48: The Court considers that this interference was in accordance with the law and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others in two respects. Firstly, it protected the local authority’s right to regain possession of the property against an individual who had no contractual or other right to be there. The domestic courts laid considerable emphasis on this aspect, which applies equally to all landlords who are trying to repossess property. However, the interference also pursued the aim of ensuring that the statutory scheme for housing provision was properly applied. The “others” in such a case are the intended beneficiaries of the complex arrangements set up by, among others, the Housing Acts. The Court accepts that it is only by limiting the protection of the Acts to the categories to which it applies that the policy underlying the Acts can sensibly be implemented.",
            "001-162117\n51: The Court is satisfied that the demolition would pursue a legitimate aim. Even if its only purpose is to ensure the effective implementation of the regulatory requirement that no buildings can be constructed without permit, it may be regarded as seeking to re-establish the rule of law (see, mutatis mutandis, Saliba v. Malta, no. 4251/02, § 44, 8 November 2005), which, in the context under examination, may be regarded as falling under “prevention of disorder” and as promoting the “economic well-being of the country”. This is particularly relevant for Bulgaria, where the problem of illegal construction appears to be rife (see paragraphs 41-43 above)."

It has held, inter alia, that the loss of one’s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home. Any person at risk of an interference of this magnitude should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8 of the Convention, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, his right of occupation has come to an end. According to Ivanova and Cherkezov v. Bulgaria, 2016, given that the right to respect for one’s home under Article 8 touches upon issues of “central importance to the individual’s physical and 81 See the Case-law Guide on Environment. moral integrity, of maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and of a secure place in the community” , the balancing exercise under that provision in cases where the interference consists of the loss of a person’s only home is of a different order, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of those concerned.

In considering whether an eviction is proportionate, the Court will take account of whether the home was lawfully established. If the home was lawfully established this factor will weigh against the legitimacy of requiring the individual to move. Conversely, if the home was established unlawfully, the position of the individual is less strong. If no alternative accommodation is available, the interference is more serious than where such accommodation is available. The more suitable the alternative accommodation is, the less serious is the interference constituted by moving the applicant from his or her existing accommodation. The evaluation of the suitability of alternative accommodation is a task that will involve consideration of the situation and particular needs of the persons concerned as well as the needs, rights and interests of the local community.

                "CASE OF AL-KHAWAJA AND TAHERY v. THE UNITED KINGDOM; § 1: The cases originated in two applications (nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Imad Al-Khawaja (“the first applicant”), on 18 July 2005 and by an Iranian national, Mr Ali Tahery (“the second applicant”), on 23 May 2006.\n2: The first applicant was represented by Mr A. Burcombe and Mr D. Wells, lawyers practising in  with Wells Burcombe LLP Solicitors, assisted by Mr J. Bennathan QC, counsel. The second applicant was represented by Mr M. Fisher, a lawyer practising in  with Peter Kandler & Co. Solicitors, assisted by Ms R. Trowler, counsel. The  Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n3: The first applicant alleged that his trial for indecent assault had been unfair because one of the two women who made complaints against him died before the trial and her statement to the police was read to the jury. The second applicant alleged that his trial for wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm had been unfair because the statement of one witness, who feared attending trial, was read to the jury.\n4: The applications were allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). On 20 January 2009, following a hearing on the admissibility and merits (Rule 54 § 3), a Chamber of that Section, composed of Josep Casadevall, Nicolas Bratza, Giovanni Bonello, Kristaq Traja, Ljiljana Mijović, Ján Šikuta and Päivi Hirvelä, judges, together with Lawrence Early, Section Registrar, decided unanimously to join the applications, to declare each application admissible and to find a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d) in respect of each applicant.\n5: On 1 March 2010, pursuant to a request by the Government dated 16 April 2009, the panel of the Grand Chamber decided to refer the case to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention.\n6: The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24. At the final deliberations, Alvina Gyulumyan, Işıl Karakaş and Nebojša Vučinić, substitute judges, replaced Corneliu Bîrsan, Ireneu Cabral Barreto and Sverre Erik Jebens, who were unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 24 § 3). Jean-Paul Costa, Christos Rozakis and Giorgio Malinverni, whose terms of office expired in the course of the proceedings, continued to sit in the case (Article 23 § 7 of the Convention and Rule 24 § 4).\n7: The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits. In addition, third-party comments were received from the London-based non-governmental organisation JUSTICE, which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 2). The parties replied to those comments (Rule 44 § 5).\n8: A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building , on 19 May 2010 (Rule 59 § 3).\n9: The first applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Brighton. The facts which gave rise to his application are as follows.\n10: While working as a consultant physician in the field of rehabilitative medicine, the first applicant was charged on two counts of indecent assault on two female patients while they were allegedly under hypnosis. The first count in the indictment alleged that he had indecently assaulted a woman called S.T. during a consultation on 3 June 2003. The second count in the indictment alleged that he had indecently assaulted a woman called V.U. also during a consultation, this time on 12 June 2003.\n11: For reasons unrelated to the alleged assault, S.T. committed suicide before the trial. However, several months after the alleged assault, she had made a statement to the police. She had also told two friends, B.F. and S.H., that the applicant had indecently assaulted her.\n12: On 22 March 2004 a preliminary hearing was held to determine whether S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury. At that hearing, the defence indicated that the defence to each count of the indictment was essentially the same, namely that S.T. and V.U.’s allegations were wholly untrue. The judge at the hearing decided that S.T.’s statement should be read to the jury at trial. He observed that the first applicant was very likely to feel that he had no realistic alternative other than to give evidence in order to defend himself on the second count relating to V.U. Therefore, the reading of S.T.’s statement would not have the effect of making it very difficult for the applicant not to give evidence. The judge also noted that collusion between S.T. and V.U. was not alleged, and so that issue did not need to be investigated by cross-examination of each woman.\n13: Having regard to the contents of S.T.’s statement, the judge also observed that it was crucial to the prosecution on count one as there was no other direct evidence of what took place during the consultation on 3 June 2003. He said: “[P]utting it bluntly, no statement, no count one.” He went on to observe that the real issue was whether it was likely to be possible for the first applicant to controvert the statement in a way that achieved fairness to the defendant. The judge found that the first applicant could give evidence as to what had happened during the consultation. It was also the intention of the prosecution to call S.T.’s friends to give evidence as to what she had said to them. There were inconsistencies between their statements and S.T.’s, which provided a route by which S.T.’s statement could be challenged. An expert witness would also be called by the prosecution to give evidence on altered perception during hypnosis and cross-examination of that witness might also serve to undermine S.T.’s credibility.\n14: At the trial, once S.T.’s statement had been read, the jury heard evidence from B.F. and S.H., S.T.’s friends. S.T.’s general practitioner also gave evidence as to a letter he had written on S.T.’s behalf to the hospital authorities, which outlined S.T.’s allegations against the first applicant. In respect of the second count, the indecent assault upon V.U., evidence was given by V.U. and by the police officers who had investigated the case. Evidence was then given by two women who alleged that the first applicant had made improper suggestions to them during hypnosis consultations. That evidence was relied on by the prosecution as “similar fact evidence” to support the evidence of S.T. and V.U. As the prosecution had indicated, expert evidence was given as to the effects of hypnosis. The defence was given the opportunity to cross-examine all the witnesses who gave live evidence. The first applicant gave evidence in his own defence. He also called a number of witnesses, who gave evidence as to his good character.\n15: In his summing up, the trial judge directed the jury, on two separate occasions, as to how they should regard S.T.’s statement. Firstly, he stated:\n16: He later stated:\n17: When referring to the evidence of S.T.’s friends, the trial judge reminded the jury that there was an inconsistency between S.T.’s account of the consultation and the account given by S.H. (in her statement S.T. said that the applicant had touched her face and mouth; S.H. gave evidence that it was S.T. herself and not the first applicant who had touched her face and mouth). The trial judge continued:\n18: The trial judge also instructed the jury that they were entitled to consider the evidence of V.U., and of the other two women who had given evidence as to the improper suggestions made by the first applicant, when deciding whether S.T.’s statement was true. However, the jury firstly had to discount the possibility of collusion between the four women. Secondly, they had to ask themselves whether it was reasonable that four people independently making similar accusations could all either be lying or mistaken or have all suffered similar hallucinations or false memory. If the jury thought that incredible, they could be satisfied that S.T. and V.U. had spoken the truth. The trial judge also directed the jury that the greater the similarity between the allegations, the greater the likelihood that the four women were telling the truth. He added that the jury also had to consider whether the women could have consciously or unconsciously been influenced by hearing of the complaints of the others.\n19: In the course of their deliberations, on two occasions the jury asked for clarification of points raised in the statement of S.T. On 30 November 2004, the first applicant was convicted by a unanimous verdict of the jury on both counts of indecent assault. He was sentenced to a fifteen-month custodial sentence on the first count and a twelve-month custodial sentence on the second count, to run consecutively.\n20: The first applicant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Appeal. The appeal centred on the pre-trial ruling to admit S.T.’s statement as evidence. It was also submitted that, in his summing up, the trial judge did not give adequate directions to the jury as to the consequential disadvantage of this evidence to the first applicant.\n21: The appeal was heard and dismissed on 6 September 2005. In its written judgment handed down on 3 November 2005 the Court of Appeal concluded that the first applicant’s right to a fair trial had not been infringed. With regard to the admission in evidence of the statement of S.T., the court held that it was not necessarily incompatible with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention. Relying on Doorson v. the Netherlands (26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II), the court held that the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter of domestic law. It then found:\n22: Turning to the issue of the trial judge’s summing up, the court stated:\n23: The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords but certified that a point of law of general public importance was involved in the decision.\n24: On 30 November 2005 the first applicant petitioned the House of Lords on the point of law certified by the Court of Appeal. On 7 February 2006 the House of Lords refused the petition.\n25: The second applicant was born in 1975. His application arises from his conviction for wounding with intent. The background to that conviction is as follows.\n26: Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed. That was the case here. That public interest must not be allowed to override the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial. Like the court in Sellick [see paragraph 48 below] we do not consider that the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights requires the conclusion that in such circumstances the trial will be unfair. The provision in Article 6 § 3 (d) that a person charged shall be able to [have] the witnesses against him examined is one specific aspect of a fair trial: but if the opportunity is not provided, the question is ‘whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way the evidence was taken, were fair’ – Doorson, paragraph 19 [see paragraph 58 below]. This was not a case where the witness had absented himself, whether through fear or otherwise, or had required anonymity, or had exercised a right to keep silent. The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.”\n27: During the fight other men were present, including the Kurdish men from the earlier altercation. A friend of S., another member of the Iranian community called T., was there, as were two of T.’s friends and the second applicant’s uncle. S could not say which of the men were behind him.\n28: S. saw a knife lying on the ground and he realised that he had been stabbed. In his evidence at the second applicant’s trial (see paragraph 32 below), he stated that he went to pick it up but that either the second applicant or T. had picked it up and thrown it towards the restaurant. S. assumed that it had been the second applicant who had stabbed him. According to S., the second applicant immediately denied this. He told S. to sit down beside him and attempted to staunch the blood flow from S.’s wounds until an ambulance arrived; when it did, he accompanied S to the hospital. At the hospital, the second applicant told the police that he had seen two black men stab S.\n29: When witnesses were questioned at the scene, no one claimed to have seen the second applicant stab S. Two days later, however, T. made a statement to the police that he had seen the second applicant stab S. In his statement, T. recounted that, when the second applicant and S. had begun fighting in the alleyway, T. had tried to separate them. He then saw the second applicant hold S. by the neck, hold up the knife and stab S. twice in the back. As T. moved towards the second applicant, the second applicant tried to stab T. in the neck. According to T., the second applicant then dropped the knife and shouted “don’t tell the police”.\n30: On 3 November 2004 the second applicant was arrested and taken to Hammersmith police station. In interview, he denied stabbing S. and again stated that two black men were responsible. He was charged with wounding with intent and also with attempting to pervert the course of justice for telling the police, at the hospital and at the police station, that he had seen two black men stab S.\n31: On 25 April 2005 the second applicant’s trial began at Blackfriars Crown Court. That day, he pleaded guilty in respect of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice but maintained his not guilty plea in respect of the charge of wounding with intent.\n32: S. gave evidence for the prosecution. He recounted how he and the second applicant had fought in the alleyway. After a minute he realised that he had been injured in the back. He had not seen who stabbed him. The second applicant had made him sit down and had covered the wound. S. had asked the second applicant who had stabbed him and the second applicant had denied that it was him. When cross-examined, S. accepted that he had not seen the second applicant go behind him and that they had been face-to-face. He also testified that he had heard someone shout to him “Tell him it was the blacks”; the voice did not belong to the second applicant.\n33: After S had given evidence, the prosecution made an application for leave to read T.’s statement pursuant to section 116(2)(e) and (4) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”; see paragraphs 43-45 below). The prosecution argued under the 2003 Act that T. was too fearful to attend trial before the jury and that he should qualify for special measures. The trial judge heard evidence from a police officer conducting the case who testified that the Iranian community was close-knit and that T.’s fear was genuine. T. also gave evidence to the trial judge (but not the jury) from behind a screen. He told the judge that he was in fear for himself and his family because of visits and telephone calls he had received, none of which were said to have been from the second applicant. He did not say who had been responsible for the visits and telephone calls.\n34: In ruling that leave should be given for the statement to be read to the jury, the trial judge stated:\n35: T.’s witness statement was then read to the jury. Evidence was also given by the doctor who had treated S. at hospital as to the nature of the wound and by a forensic scientist who had tested the blood found on the second applicant’s clothes and confirmed it matched that of S. (though no firm conclusions could be drawn as to how it had been deposited on the clothes). The record of the second applicant’s interview by the police was also tendered by the prosecution (see paragraph 30 above).\n36: The second applicant gave evidence in his defence. He stated that he had been present at the earlier altercation with the Kurdish men. When he and S. later met outside the restaurant, he had taken S. by the hand and suggested that they go and talk, but S. had begun to punch him. He had defended himself by grabbing S. by the collar and pushing him. T. had then tried to intervene and a number of other members of the Iranian community had restrained S. T. had been standing between S. and the second applicant and, at this stage, the second applicant noticed the knife on the ground. He had picked it up and thrown it, not knowing at this point that S. had been stabbed. When S blamed him for the stabbing, the second applicant had told him to sit down and had successfully calmed him down. He placed his hand on the wound on S.’s back. S. then appeared to accept that the second applicant had not stabbed him. The second applicant also gave evidence that he had told the police that two black men were responsible because this was what his uncle had told him to say. Finally, the second applicant gave evidence that, before he had been interviewed by the police, T. had told him that he, T., knew that the second applicant had not stabbed S.\n37: The judge, in his summing up, warned the jury about the danger of relying on the evidence of T. He stated:\n38: On 29 April 2005 the second applicant was convicted by a majority verdict of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, for which he was later sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with a term of fifteen months’ imprisonment for the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice to which he had pleaded guilty.\n39: The second applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the inability to cross-examine T. infringed his right to a fair trial. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the Crown accepted that T.’s statement was “both important and probative of a major issue in the case ... had it not been admitted the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced”. The court upheld the reasoning of the trial judge, stating that there was available not only cross-examination of other prosecution witnesses but also evidence from the second applicant himself and the potential for evidence from other bystanders in order to prevent unfairness. It was also stated that the trial judge had explicitly warned the jury in detail as to how they should treat this evidence and properly directed them as to how they should consider it in reaching their verdict. Although the second applicant maintained that even a proper direction by the judge could not cure the unfairness, the Court of Appeal held that the jury was informed of all matters necessary to its decision-making process. Leave to appeal on conviction was refused on 24 January 2006. The Court of Appeal did, however, give the second applicant leave to appeal against his sentence and reduced the sentence of nine years’ imprisonment to seven years’ imprisonment.\n40: Hearsay evidence is any statement of fact other than one made, of his own knowledge, by a witness in the course of oral testimony (see paragraph 20 of the judgment of Lord Phillips in R. v. Horncastle and others, summarised at paragraphs 57 to 62 below). As a general rule it is inadmissible in a criminal case unless there is a common-law rule or statutory provision which allows for its admission. The relevant statutory provisions applicable to each applicant are set in the following section. Those statutory provisions are supplemented by three common-law principles. Firstly, there is an additional discretion at common law for a trial judge to exclude any evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. This, in turn, is supplemented by section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which provides the court with a discretion to exclude evidence if its admission would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the trial that it ought not to be admitted. Secondly, if hearsay evidence is admitted and the jury have heard it, the trial judge, in his summing up, must direct the jury as to the dangers of relying on hearsay evidence. Thirdly, in a jury trial, the jury must receive the traditional direction as to the burden of proof, namely that they must be satisfied of the defendant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.\n41: At the time of the first applicant’s trial, the relevant statutory provisions were to be found in sections 23 to 28 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”). Section 23 of the 1988 Act provides for the admission of first-hand documentary hearsay in a criminal trial:\n42: In its report of April 1997, entitled “Evidence in Criminal Proceedings: Hearsay and Related Topics”, the Law Commission recommended a series of reforms to the law of hearsay in England and Wales, including the provisions contained in the 1988 Act. In addition to recommending clarification of the conditions under which a witness statement could be admitted at trial (including the existing grounds of death and fear), the Commission proposed that there should be a limited discretion to admit hearsay evidence that did not fall within any other statutory or common-law exception (recommendation 28).\n43: Part 11, Chapter 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”) came into force in April 2005. It was intended to reform substantially the law governing the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings on the basis of the draft bill proposed by the Law Commission.\n44: The “gateway” relied on in the second applicant’s case was section 116, which allows for the admission of statements of absent witnesses. Section 116, where relevant, provides:\n45: By section 121 of the 2003 Act, section 116(2)(e) can only be relied upon in respect of first-hand hearsay; it cannot be relied only to allow the admission of multiple hearsay.\n46: The conditions under which witnesses can give evidence anonymously in criminal proceedings are now regulated by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”). Formerly, this was regulated by similar provisions in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008, which was enacted following the House of Lords’ judgment in R. v. Davis (see paragraphs 49 and 50 below). Under the 2009 Act, witnesses can only give evidence anonymously when, upon the application of either the prosecution or a defendant in the proceedings, the trial judge makes a “witness anonymity order”. Section 87 requires that the trial judge be informed of the identity of the witness. Sections 88(2)-(6) and 89 lay down the conditions for the making of a witness anonymity order. In deciding whether those conditions are met, the court must have regard, inter alia, to whether evidence given by the witness might be the sole or decisive evidence implicating the defendant (section 89(2)(c)).\n47: Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen. Section 6(1) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n48: This Court’s judgment in Lucà v. Italy (no. 33354/96, § 40, ECHR 2001II) was considered by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Sellick and Sellick [2005] EWCA Crim 651, which concerned two defendants who were alleged to have intimidated witnesses. Leave was given by the trial judge to have the witnesses’ statements read to the jury. The defendants appealed on the ground that the admission of the statements breached Article 6 § 1 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d). The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. In considering the relevant case-law of this Court, at paragraph 50 of its judgment, it stated that what appeared from that case-law were the following propositions:\n49: In R. v. Davis [2008] UKHL 36, the House of Lords considered an appeal against conviction by a defendant who had been convicted of two counts of murder by shooting. Three witnesses had given evidence at trial identifying the defendant as the gunman. They gave evidence anonymously, testifying behind a screen so that they could be seen by the judge and jury but not the defendant. The House of Lords unanimously allowed the defendant’s appeal.\n50: Lord Mance, concurring in judgment, considered the relevant authorities of this Court on Article 6. Having done so, he doubted that there was an absolute requirement that anonymous testimony should not be the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant. Instead, the extent to which such testimony is decisive might be no more than a very important factor to balance in the scales. He also considered that R. v. Sellick and Sellick (among other authorities) served as a caution against treating the Convention, or apparently general statements by this Court, as containing absolutely inflexible rules.\n51: The Chamber judgment of 20 January 2009 in the present cases was considered by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in R. v. Horncastle and others. The case concerned the appeals of four defendants who had been convicted on the basis of statements of absent victims, which were read at trial under section 116 of the 2003 Act. For two of the defendants, the maker of the statement had died. For another two, the witness was too fearful to attend trial. Their appeals were heard together with that of a fifth defendant, Carter, who had been convicted on the basis of business records, which were introduced at his trial.\n52: On 22 May 2009 the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeals of the first four defendants ([2009] EWCA Crim 964). It accepted that Article 6 § 3 (d) had a content of its own but, given that it did not create any absolute right to have every witness examined, the balance struck by the 2003 Act was legitimate and wholly consistent with the Convention. There could be a very real disadvantage in admitting hearsay evidence and it needed cautious handling. However, having regard to the safeguards contained in the 2003 Act, which were rigorously applied, there would be no violation of Article 6 if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive degree on hearsay evidence. Where the hearsay evidence was demonstrably reliable, or its reliability could properly be tested and assessed, the rights of the defence would be respected, there would be sufficient counterbalancing measures and the trial would be fair. It was not appropriate that there should be a rule that counterbalancing measures could never be sufficient where the evidence was sole or decisive. This had been considered and rejected by the Law Commission and Parliament when it enacted the 2003 Act.\n53: There were also principled and practical difficulties with a sole or decisive rule. Firstly, as a principled difficulty, the test assumed that all hearsay evidence was unreliable in the absence of testing in open court, and secondly, it further assumed that the fact-finder (such as the jury) could not be trusted to assess the weight of the evidence. Neither assumption was justified. For the first, the Court of Appeal gave examples of hearsay evidence that would be reliable such as a victim who, before dying, revealed the name of his or her murderer. For the second, the Court of Appeal found that juries were perfectly able to understand the limitations of written statements and, under section 124 of the 2003 Act, would be provided with material about the maker of the statement (see paragraph 45 above). The mere fact that the evidence was an essential link in the chain of evidence against the accused did not alter that conclusion. For example, forensic evidence might depend on work done by unidentified laboratory assistants (and to that extent was hearsay). However, it was not necessary for every member of the laboratory who had worked with the evidence to be called in order for the strength of the evidence to be tested.\n54: The court also found that there were practical difficulties with the sole or decisive rule as a test of admissibility of evidence. It observed:\n55: The Court of Appeal also considered that the safeguard in section 125 of the 2003 Act (the power of a trial judge to stop the case if the hearsay evidence is unconvincing; see paragraph 45 above) provided for a “proportionate assessment of the reliability” of hearsay evidence and it would not serve justice if that power were to be trammelled by a requirement that it be exercised in every case in which the hearsay evidence were the sole or decisive evidence. Sole or decisive hearsay could be wholly convincing and, equally, evidence which was neither sole nor decisive might have such a potential influence on the jury that the judge would be persuaded that a conviction was unsafe. Where there was a legitimate argument that that hearsay was unconvincing and important to the case, the trial judge was required to make up his own mind as to whether a conviction would be safe; this involved assessing the reliability of the hearsay evidence, its place in the evidence as a whole, the issues in the case as they had emerged, and all the other individual circumstances of the case. Finally, the other safeguards contained in the 2003 Act were rigorously applied and the difficulties faced by defendants when hearsay was admitted were well understood by the courts. The Act did not equate hearsay with first-hand evidence; on the contrary it required cautious handling.\n56: The Court of Appeal also gave guidance as to assessing when it would be appropriate to allow hearsay evidence to be introduced because a witness was in fear. There was, in the case-law of this Court, no requirement that the fear had to be attributable to the defendant, and the essential questions were whether there was a justifiable reason for the absence of the witness supported by evidence and whether the evidence was demonstrably reliable or its reliability could be properly tested and assessed. The Court of Appeal added:\n57: On 9 December 2009 the United Kingdom Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment ([2009] UKSC 14). Lord Phillips, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, found that, although domestic courts were required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to take account of the Strasbourg jurisprudence in applying principles that were clearly established, on rare occasions, where a court was concerned that the Strasbourg judgment did not sufficiently appreciate or accommodate some aspect of English law, it might decline to follow the judgment. The Chamber judgment was such a case.\n58: Lord Phillips considered that a defendant should not be immune from conviction where a witness, who had given critical and apparently reliable evidence in a statement, was unavailable to give evidence at trial through death or some other reason. In analysing the relevant case-law of this Court on Article 6 § 3 (d), Lord Phillips concluded that, although this Court had recognised the need for exceptions to the strict application of Article 6 § 3 (d), the manner in which it approved those exceptions resulted in a jurisprudence which lacked clarity. The sole or decisive rule had been introduced into the Strasbourg case-law in Doorson (cited above) without discussion of the underlying principle or full consideration of whether there was justification for imposing the rule as an overriding principle applicable equally to continental and common-law jurisdictions. Indeed, the rule seemed to have been created because, in contrast to the common law, continental systems of criminal procedure did not have a comparable body of jurisprudence or rules governing the admissibility of evidence.\n59: Lord Phillips, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, found that the rule would create severe practical difficulties if applied to English criminal procedure. Firstly, it was not easy to apply because it was not clear what was meant by “decisive”: under English criminal procedure no evidence could be admitted unless it was potentially probative and, in theory, any item of probative evidence could make the difference between conviction and acquittal. Secondly, it would be hard enough to apply that test at first instance but it would be impossible for national appellate courts or this Court to decide whether a particular statement was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction. In a jury trial, the only way the rule could be applied would be to exclude all hearsay evidence.\n60: Lord Phillips also observed:\n61: Lord Phillips instead concluded that the 2003 Act made such a rule unnecessary in English criminal procedure because, if the 2003 Act were observed, there would be no breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) even if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive extent on hearsay evidence. To demonstrate this point, Annex 4 to the judgment analysed a series of cases against other Contracting States where this Court had found a violation of Article 6 § 1 when taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d). In each case, had the trial taken place in England and Wales, the witness’s testimony would not have been admissible under the 2003 Act either because the witness was anonymous and absent or because the trial court had not made sufficient enquiries to ensure there was good reason for the witness’s absence. Alternatively, had the evidence been admitted, any conviction would have been quashed on appeal.\n62: Lord Brown delivered a concurring judgment in which he stated:\n63: Subject to certain statutory exceptions, in Scots criminal law a person cannot be convicted of a crime or statutory offence on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness, however credible (see Morton v. HM Advocate 1938 JC 52, quoted in Campbell v. HM Advocate 2004 SLT 135).\n64: Hearsay is regulated by section 259 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which allows for its admissibility under certain conditions, including when the person who made the statement is dead. Section 259(4) permits evidence to be admitted which is relevant to the credibility of the person as a witness. In N v. HM Advocate 2003 SLT 761 the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, reluctantly reached the conclusion that section 259 deprived the court of the discretion it previously enjoyed at common law to exclude such evidence if it was unreliable. Lord Justice Clerk observed that, notwithstanding section 259, the long-recognised dangers in hearsay evidence remained. He added:\n65: The High Court of Justiciary also considered the compatibility of the introduction of the evidence of an absent witness with Article 6 § 3 (d) in McKenna v. HM Advocate. In that case, a murder trial, the prosecution sought to introduce statements made to the police by a possible co-accused who had since died. In a previous ruling given before trial (2000 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, had found that it was only in extreme circumstances that an accused could contend in advance of trial that the introduction of the hearsay evidence would be so prejudicial to the prospects of a fair trial that the court could determine the issue in advance. It therefore allowed the trial to proceed. When the statements were introduced at trial and the accused was convicted, he appealed against his conviction. In its judgment dismissing the appeal (2003 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary found that, while the statements were important evidence, having regard to the other evidence led at trial (which included admissions by the accused and forensic evidence), it could not be said that the appellant’s conviction was based to a decisive extent on them. The jury had also been adequately and satisfactorily directed as to how to approach the absent witness’s statement. A similar conclusion was reached by the same court in HM Advocate v. M 2003 SLT 1151.\n66: The compatibility of the admission of hearsay evidence with Article 6 § 3 (d) was further considered by the High Court of Justiciary in Campbell v. HM Advocate (cited above). The court observed that, in the relevant case-law of this Court, many of the violations of Article 6 § 3 (d) which had been found had arisen in jurisdictions which did not apply the Scots law rule of corroboration:\n67: The court added that, in directing a jury, the guidance given by the Lord Justice Clerk in the case of N v. HM Advocate (cited above), should be borne in mind. The High Court allowed the appeal of the first appellant in the case of Campbell (cited above) because of the inadequacy of the trial judge’s direction to the jury. It dismissed the second appellant’s appeal in so far as it related to Article 6 of the Convention, finding that the hearsay evidence was not decisive and that the principal evidence against him came from a witness who had testified in court.\n68: Campbell was applied in HM Advocate v. Johnston 2004 SLT 1005 where, in a ruling given during the trial, the Lord Ordinary allowed the admission of a witness statement made to the police by a witness who subsequently died before trial; the statement was admissible, inter alia, because it could not be “decisive”. In Humphrey v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 30, the High Court of Justiciary observed that it had “great difficulty” in understanding the meaning of the word “decisive” in the context of a case based on circumstantial evidence but, in that case, the evidence in the form of a police statement of a witness who had died was not “remotely decisive” and there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction without it. Similar results were reached in Allison v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 63, and Harkins v. HM Advocate [2008] HCJAC 69.\n69: In its March 2010 Consultation Paper on Hearsay in Civil and Criminal Cases, the Law Reform Commission of Ireland provisionally recommended that, subject to existing common law and statutory inclusionary exceptions, hearsay should continue to be excluded in criminal proceedings. It also provisionally recommended that there should be no statutory introduction of a residual discretion to include hearsay evidence and that the concepts of reliability and necessity should not form the basis for reform of the hearsay rule because they lacked clarity.\n70: The Commission also noted:\n71: The Commission declined to recommend that the statutory scheme in England and Wales and in particular section 114 of the 2003 Act, be adopted in . It observed:\n72: A strict approach to the exclusion of out-of-court statements has always been taken by the Australian courts (see, for example, Bannon v. The Queen (1995) 185 CLR 1).\n73: The admission of hearsay in federal criminal proceedings in  is now regulated by the Evidence Act 1995. Section 65 of the Act allows the admission of evidence as to previous representations (for example statements) when a witness is not available to give evidence about an “asserted fact”. Such evidence will be admissible, inter alia, when: (i) the representation was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication (section 65(2)(b)); or (ii) when the representation was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation was reliable (section 65(2)(c)).\n74: The use of these provisions to admit the statement of a witness who died before trial was considered by the Federal Court of Australia in Williams v. The Queen (2000) 119 A Crim R 490. The court found that, in the circumstances of the case, the statement made to the police was not sufficiently reliable, particularly when the witness had reasons to tell the police what they wanted to hear. Equivalent statutory provisions were considered by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Harris v. The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 454, where the deceased complainant’s statement was found to be sufficiently reliable to be admitted, given that, inter alia, the complainant knew that the police would interview other witnesses in the case.\n75: The law of hearsay in Canada has been reformed as a result of three principal decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, which created a “principled approach” to the admissibility of hearsay evidence.\n76: Firstly, in R. v. Khan [1990] 2 SCR 531, the Supreme Court found that the trial judge had erred in refusing to allow the victim, a three-and-a-half-year-old girl who alleged that she had been sexually assaulted, to give unsworn evidence and his refusal to allow the Crown to introduce statements the child had made to her mother fifteen minutes after the assault. If unsworn evidence could not be given there would be a danger that offences against very young children could never be prosecuted. In respect of the statements to the mother, the Supreme Court found that it was appropriate to take a more flexible but “principled” approach to hearsay. Despite the need for caution, hearsay could be admitted where the two general requirements of necessity and reliability were met. In determining admissibility the trial judge was required to have regard to the need to safeguard the interests of the accused. Concerns as to the credibility of the evidence remained to be addressed by submissions as to the weight to be accorded to it and submissions as to the quality of any corroborating evidence.\n77: Secondly, in R. v. Smith [1992] 2 SCR 915 the Court approved the “principled approach” taken in Khan and found that two telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother shortly before her death were admissible. However, the mother’s evidence as to the contents of a third telephone call should have not been admitted as the conditions under which that call was made did not provide the “circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness” which would justify its admission without the possibility of cross-examination.\n78: Khan and Smith were followed in R. v. Rockey [1996] 3 SCR 829. The Supreme Court was satisfied that any reasonable trial judge would have found it necessary to admit pre-trial statements made by a child, who was five years old at trial, in which he complained that he had been sexually assaulted. It was observed by McLachlin J (concurring in judgment) that the case against the appellant was strong: the child’s statements were entirely consistent and supported, inter alia, by medical evidence and evidence of behavioural changes in him after the assault and the absence of any plausible explanation of someone other than the appellant perpetrating the assault.\n79: The third and most significant development in the Supreme Court’s case-law was its judgment in R. v. Khewalon [2006] 2 SCR 787, which took a stricter approach to reliability. The case concerned a complaint of assault made by an elderly resident at a retirement home against one of the home’s employees. The patient, S., gave the police a videotaped statement; the statement was unsworn. After S.’s statement other residents came forward to give statements that they too had been assaulted by the accused. By the time of trial, all those who had made statements, including S, had either died or were no longer competent to testify. Some of the statements were admitted by the trial judge because of the striking similarity between them. The Court of Appeal for  excluded all the statements and acquitted the accused. The Supreme Court dismissed the Crown’s appeal from that decision and affirmed the acquittal. The Supreme Court clarified its previous case-law on reliability and stated that the reliability requirement would generally be met by showing: (i) that there was no real concern about whether the statement was true or not because of the circumstances in which it came about; or (ii) that no real concern arose because the truth and accuracy of the statement could nonetheless be sufficiently tested by means other than cross-examination. It was for the trial judge to make a preliminary assessment of the “threshold” reliability of the statement and to leave the ultimate determination of its worth to the fact-finder/jury. All relevant factors had to be considered by the trial judge including, in appropriate cases, the presence of supporting or contradictory evidence. Charron J, giving the unanimous judgment of the court, stated (at paragraph 49 of the judgment):\n80: The court concluded that S.’s statements were not admissible. It observed that the charges against Khelawon in respect of S. were “entirely based” on the truthfulness of the allegations contained in S.’s statements (paragraph 101 of the judgment). The absence of any opportunity to cross-examine him had a bearing on the question of reliability and there were no adequate substitutes for testing the evidence. The principled exceptions to the hearsay rule did not provide a vehicle for founding a conviction on the basis of a police statement, videotaped or otherwise, without more (paragraph 106 of the judgment). Nor could the reliability requirement be met by relying on the inherent trustworthiness of the statement; this was not a case such as Khan where the cogency of the evidence was such that it would be pedantic to insist upon testing by cross-examination. S. was elderly and frail; his mental capacity was at issue and there was medical evidence that his injuries could have arisen from a fall. It was also not clear that he had understood the consequences of his statement for the accused. In the circumstances, S.’s unavailability for cross-examination posed significant limitations on the accused’s ability to test the evidence and, in turn, on the trier of fact’s ability to properly assess its worth.\n81: In its report of November 2009, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong proposed substantial reforms to the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings in that jurisdiction. It proposed that the present rule in Hong Kong against the admission of hearsay evidence should be retained but there should be greater scope to admit hearsay evidence in specific circumstances. The Commission rejected the English statutory scheme contained in the 2003 Act, observing that Hong Kong had none of the statutory mechanisms for excluding hearsay which applied in England and Wales, such as section 126(1) of the 2003 Act and section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (see paragraphs 40 and 45 above). The Commission also observed that grounds for admitting hearsay under section 116 of the 2003 Act, although offering a fair degree of certainty and consistency in decision-making, had “an over-inclusive effect by allowing in all types of relevant evidence, including unreliable hearsay evidence” (paragraph 8.25 of the report).\n82: The New Zealand Law Commission, in its 1999 Report on Evidence, recommended that the admissibility of hearsay should be based on two considerations: reliability and necessity. That recommendation was enacted in the Evidence Act 2006, which came into force in 2007. Section 18(1) of the Act provides:\n83: “Circumstances” for these purposes are defined in section 16(1) as including: (a) the nature of the statement; (b) the contents of the statement; (c) the circumstances that relate to the making of the statement; (d) any circumstances that relate to the veracity of the person; and (e) any circumstances that relate to the accuracy of the observation of the person.\n84: Section 8(1) of the Act provides that evidence must be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will (a) have an unfairly prejudicial effect on the proceeding; or (b) needlessly prolong the proceeding. Section 8(2) provides that in determining whether the probative value of evidence is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will have an unfairly prejudicial effect on a criminal proceeding, the judge must take into account the right of the defendant to offer an effective defence.\n85: Although jury trials are no longer used in , it too has substantially reformed its law of hearsay. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act 45 of 1988 defines hearsay as evidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving evidence. By section 3(1) such hearsay evidence is not admissible unless (i) it is admitted by consent; (ii) the person upon whose credibility the evidence depends testifies; or (iii) the court is of the opinion that the evidence should be admitted in the interests of justice. Section 3(1)(c) provides that, in forming its opinion, the court must have regard to: (i) the nature of the proceedings; (ii) the nature of the evidence; (iii) the purpose for which the evidence is tendered; (iv) the probative value of the evidence; (v) the reason why the evidence is not given by the person upon whose credibility the probative value of such evidence depends; (vi) any prejudice to a party which the admission of such evidence might entail; and (vii) any factor which should in the opinion of the court be taken into account.\n86: In State v. Ramavhale [1996] ZASCA 14, the Supreme Court observed that, notwithstanding the wording of section 3(1), there remained an “intuitive reluctance to permit untested evidence to be used against an accused in a criminal case”. It also endorsed previous authority that a court should “hesitate long” in admitting or relying on hearsay evidence which plays a decisive or even significant part in convicting an accused, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. Despite the reforms enacted by section 3(1), the Supreme Court found that reliability was a factor that should continue to be considered in determining the admissibility of hearsay. Moreover, in that case, in assessing what prejudice would arise to the accused if the hearsay were admitted, the trial judge had erred in relying upon the fact that the accused had other avenues open to him to counter the evidence, one of which was to give evidence himself; the logical conclusion of this approach was that the State, by introducing “flimsy” hearsay could force the accused to testify in a case where the absence of direct evidence was such that he would be entitled not to testify.\n87: The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America guarantees the accused in all criminal prosecutions the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him (“the confrontation clause”). In Ohio v. Roberts 448 US 56 (1980) the Supreme Court of the United States of America held that evidence with “particularized guarantees of trustworthiness” was admissible without confrontation. That was overruled in Crawford v. Washington 541 US 36 (2004), where the court ruled that the confrontation clause applied to all evidence which was testimonial in nature and there was no basis in the Sixth Amendment for admitting evidence only on the basis of its reliability. Where testimonial statements were at issue, the only indicium of reliability which was sufficient was the one prescribed by the Constitution: confrontation. Consequently, testimonial evidence was thus inadmissible unless the witness appeared at trial or, if the witness was unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination (see also Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts 129 SCt 2527 (2009), and Bullcoming v. New Mexico 131 SCt 2705 (2011)).\n88: Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention read as follows:\n89: For the Chamber, the provisions of Article 6 § 3 (d), as with the other elements of Article 6 § 3, was one of the minimum rights which had to be accorded to anyone who was charged with a criminal offence. The Chamber also observed that as minimum rights, the provisions of Article 6 § 3 constituted express guarantees and could not be read as illustrations of matters to be taken into account when considering whether a fair trial had been held.\n90: The Chamber then observed that whatever the reason for the defendant’s inability to examine a witness, whether absence, anonymity or both, the starting point for the Court’s assessment of whether there was a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) was set out in Lucà, cited above, § 40:\n91: The Chamber noted that both parties were content to approach the matter on the basis that each conviction was based solely or to a decisive degree on the two witnesses concerned and it proceeded on the same basis. The Chamber then considered the counterbalancing factors which the Government relied on in each case. Firstly, it considered the counterbalancing factors that, in each case, the trial judge correctly applied the relevant statutory test and that the Court of Appeal reviewed the safety of each conviction. It found these factors to be of limited weight since the very issue in each case was whether the trial judges and the Court of Appeal had acted compatibly with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.\n92: In respect of Mr Al-Khawaja, the Chamber continued:\n93: In respect of Mr Tahery, the Chamber observed:\n94: The Government considered that Article 6 § 3 (d) was an express guarantee but not an absolute rule from which no derogation was possible: the focus was on the proceedings as a whole, the safeguards available to the accused, the reliability of the evidence and, in appropriate cases, the interests of witnesses or victims. An inflexible sole or decisive rule was incompatible with the Court’s general approach to Article 6 § 3 (d).\n95: The Government submitted that the manner in which the Court had applied and developed the test lacked clarity in a number of respects: there had been no adequate discussion of the principle underlying the rule; there had never been a full consideration of whether it should be applied equally to civil and common-law jurisdictions; prior to A.M. v. Italy (no. 37019/97, ECHR 1999IX), there was no support in the Court’s case-law for applying the test in respect of an absent witness whose identity was known to the defence; and it was not possible to discern any consistency in the Court’s case-law as to when evidence was to be regarded as decisive.\n96: The Government further submitted that the sole or decisive rule, as applied by the Chamber in its judgment, was predicated on the false assumption that all hearsay evidence which was critical to a case was either unreliable or, in the absence of cross-examination of the witness, incapable of proper assessment. In fact, sole or decisive hearsay might be perfectly reliable and cross-examination might add little or nothing to the assessment of its reliability. The rule could produce arbitrary results; it could operate to exclude evidence simply because it was important, irrespective of its reliability or cogency. The Chamber had not explained whether or how the issue of reliability was relevant to the application of the rule. It had not conducted a full analysis of the safeguards available in England and Wales, nor had it appreciated the important difference between common-law trial procedures and those of other Contracting States. It had not explained when evidence would be decisive with sufficient precision to enable a trial court to apply the sole or decisive rule in practice or given adequate consideration to the practical problems which would arise by application of the rule in England and Wales.\n97: The test would also serve as an incentive to intimidate witnesses, particularly when only one witness had been courageous enough to come forward. It would have greatest impact in sexual abuse cases, where the offending usually took place in private and thus the evidence of the victim was likely to be “sole or decisive”.\n98: For these reasons, the Government invited the Court to adopt the approach taken by the Supreme Court in Horncastle and others. The Supreme Court’s judgment demonstrated that this Court’s case-law permitted a more flexible approach than the apparently hard-edged sole or decisive rule set out by the Chamber. In the light of the Supreme Court’s conclusion in Horncastle and others that the sole or decisive rule would give rise to severe practical difficulties in England and Wales, the Government invited the Court to make clear that the importance of the untested evidence was better regarded as one factor among others which were to be taken into account when deciding whether the proceedings as a whole were fair. Alternatively, the Government suggested that any sole or decisive rule should not apply when there were good reasons for the unavailability of the witness such as those set out in section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”) and section 116(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”).\n99: The Government underlined that general safeguards protected the defendant against unfairness as a result of the admission of hearsay evidence. The trial judge acted as “gatekeeper”: he had a duty at common law and under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to prevent the jury hearing evidence which would have such an adverse effect on proceedings that it ought not to be received. The trial judge had to be satisfied that the prosecution could not adduce the evidence by calling the witness and he had to direct the jury on the dangers of relying on hearsay evidence. The jury had to be satisfied of the defendant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt and there remained the possibility of appeal to the Court of Appeal, which would grant the appeal if the conviction were unsafe.\n100: In the 1988 Act, section 23 made provision for the admissibility of a written statement in certain, enumerated circumstances and it applied equally to the prosecution and defence. The trial judge was required to subject the need to admit the evidence to rigorous scrutiny. Section 25 allowed the judge to refuse to admit the statement if he was of the opinion that it ought not to be admitted in the interests of justice (a reliability and due process safeguard). Section 26, which applied to statements prepared for the purpose of criminal proceedings, required the judge to have regard to the nature, source and contents of the statement, the availability of other evidence, the relevance of the evidence and the extent to which its admission would result in unfairness to the accused. Schedule 2 to the 1988 Act also allowed the admission of evidence relating to the credibility and consistency of the maker of the statement.\n101: In respect of the 2003 Act, the Government underlined that this had been enacted after a detailed review of the hearsay rule by the Law Commission, which had concluded that many of the assumptions underpinning the traditional exclusion of hearsay were not justified: for example, it had found that hearsay evidence was not necessarily inaccurate or unreliable and that, in many cases, the rule had led to the arbitrary exclusion of cogent evidence.\n102: As with the 1988 Act, the 2003 Act allowed both the prosecution and defence to apply to adduce hearsay evidence. Section 116(2)(e) had been included in the 2003 Act in order to tackle crime by providing special measures to protect witnesses who have a genuine fear of intimidation and repercussions. When application was made because the witness was in fear, the trial judge could only give leave when the admission of the statement was in the interests of justice. Moreover, and contrary to many other member States of the Council of Europe, the Act did not allow for the admission of hearsay evidence from anonymous and absent witnesses. Finally, the Government underlined the further protections provided by sections 124 to 126 of the Act (see paragraph 45 above).\n103: In respect of Mr Al-Khawaja, the Government submitted that the relevant facts were that S.T. had not been called to give evidence for a justifiable reason (death). The trial judge accepted that the admission of her statement was in the interests of justice and, in reaching that conclusion, had taken into account the disadvantages that might be caused to the first applicant. The defence had accepted that they would be in a position to rebut the statement.\n104: S.T.’s statement was not sole or decisive. There was other evidence in the case supporting it, including evidence that she had made a prompt complaint, evidence of her demeanour when she made the complaint and strikingly similar allegations made by other women. The first applicant had been able to cross-examine the other witnesses, give evidence in his own defence and address the jury in relation to the case against him. The jury was carefully directed both in relation to S.T.’s statement and the burden of proof in the case. The 1988 Act had been properly applied and there was no basis for contradicting the assessment of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal that admission of the statement was fair.\n105: In Mr Tahery’s case, T.’s fear was a justifiable reason for not calling him. As in the case of the first applicant, the trial judge had concluded that the admission of the evidence was in the interests of justice and, in reaching that conclusion, had taken into account the disadvantages that might be caused to the defence. T.’s evidence was not sole or decisive: there was other evidence supporting it, including the second applicant’s admission that he was present at the time of the offence, had handled the knife used to stab the victim, had been involved in an altercation with S and had lied to the police. The second applicant had been able to cross-examine the other witness, give evidence in his own defence and address the jury in relation to the case against him. The jury was carefully directed both in relation to T.’s statement and the burden of proof in the case. The 2003 Act had been properly applied and there was no basis for contradicting the assessment of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal that admission of the statement was fair.\n106: The applicants submitted that there were three possible approaches to Article 6 § 3 (d). The first was the rigid and literal approach taken by the United States Supreme Court in respect of the similar provisions of the Sixth Amendment, which the applicants did not urge the Court to adopt. The second, the approach taken by the Court, did not treat the words of Article 6 § 3 (d) as inflexible but interpreted them as setting a minimum irreducible core of fairness. This approach rested on the sole or decisive rule and was the correct one. The third approach was that taken by the United Kingdom Government and the Supreme Court in Horncastle and others, which, in the applicants’ submission, reduced the guarantees offered by Article 6 § 3 to matters only to be considered in deciding whether an accused had had a fair trial.\n107: Moreover, the rationale for the rule was clear: in assessing whether, when hearsay evidence had been admitted, the procedures followed had been sufficient to counterbalance the difficulties caused to the defence, due weight had to be given to the extent to which the relevant evidence had been decisive in convicting the applicant. If the evidence was not decisive, the defence was handicapped to a much lesser degree and, if the evidence was decisive, the handicap was much greater. The applicants submitted that the rule had been stated in clear and simple terms in Lucà (cited above, § 40); it was well-established in the Court’s case-law and a principled, practical and sensible interpretation of Article 6 § 3 (d).\n108: The applicants submitted that the Supreme Court was incorrect to take the approach it had taken in Horncastle and others. It had erred in finding that the approach taken by the Chamber would lead to the exclusion of evidence that was cogent and demonstrably reliable. There were inherent dangers in admitting untested evidence which appeared to be demonstrably reliable: the law was full of cases where evidence had appeared overwhelming only for it to be shown later that this was not the case.\n109: Lord Phillips had suggested that Article 6 § 3 (d) was intended to address a weakness in civil-law, as opposed to common-law, systems. However, the applicants submitted that, whatever the historic roots of that Article, English law had moved away from the traditional rule against hearsay. It was also impermissible for different standards to apply to different legal systems: this would undermine the very nature of the Convention system.\n110: The applicants also considered that the Supreme Court was wrong to find that there would be practical difficulties in applying the sole or decisive rule in England and . “Decisive” clearly meant evidence that was central to the case and, in applying the rule, the Court itself had shown that it was possible to decide what evidence was sole or decisive. Before the Chamber the Government had had no difficulty in conceding that the evidence of the absent witness in each case was sole or decisive. Trial judges in the  routinely assessed complicated factual circumstances and assessed whether legal tests such as “fairness” or “sufficient evidence” had been met. In addition, the test had been included in the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 in respect of anonymous witnesses (see paragraph 46 above). The applicants also observed that the Supreme Court had laid great emphasis on demonstrating that the outcome of cases decided by this Court would have been the same if decided under the 1988 and 2003 Acts. The corollary of this proposition was that the implementation of the sole or decisive rule would lead to the same result in many cases before the domestic courts prior to any such implementation.\n111: The applicants also submitted that, contrary to the Government’s submissions and the observations of the Supreme Court in Horncastle and others, the Chamber had understood the procedural safeguards contained in the 1988 and 2003 Acts. Those procedures could only provide adequate protection if they operated as part of a scheme where the core values of Article 6 prevailed; they could not do so until the domestic courts had proper regard to the right of an accused to examine witnesses against him.\n112: For the applicants, the sole or decisive nature of the untested evidence in each case meant that no procedures short of questioning the relevant witnesses could have secured a fair trial. In the first applicant’s case, there were obvious questions which could have been posed to S.T., not least whether she had heard of V.U.’s allegations before she made her statement and why she had waited nearly four months before making the statement. In the second applicant’s case, the obvious questions which could have been posed to T. were why he had not spoken to the police on the night of the incident, what view he had of the very quick incident, whether he knew the other men at the scene and whether he had any reason to protect them. In the absence of cross-examination, therefore, the procedural safeguards contained in the 1988 and 2003 Acts were insufficient. The fact that the trial judge in each case had applied the “interests of justice” test took the question to be determined no further: that test had to be applied in accordance with Article 6 and whether the trial judges had correctly decided that the admission of each statement was in the interests of justice was, in effect, the issue for the Court to determine.\n113: Nor was it of any relevance that the applicants were entitled to introduce evidence challenging the credibility of the absent witnesses: there was no such material available for each witness and the statutory provisions provided no opportunity for challenging the credibility or truthfulness of the witnesses as to the central allegation in each case. The applicants also submitted that no warning from the trial judge could compensate for the lack of opportunity for the jury to see and hear a witness of such importance, nor prevent the danger that the evidence would have a probative value that it did not deserve. The right of appeal against conviction was of no effect since the Court of Appeal in each case had refused to apply the sole or decisive rule as set out in Lucà (cited above).\n114: JUSTICE (see paragraph 7 above) submitted that the right to examine witnesses was an ancient one. It was rooted in Roman law and the historic common-law right of confrontation. That common-law right recognised the dangers of admitting hearsay, including its inherent unreliability. It had, in turn, shaped the fair-trial guarantees enshrined in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the criminal procedure of all common-law countries and international human rights law. Although the hearsay rule had become too rigid in English law, it was incorrect to state, as the Supreme Court had in Horncastle and others, that the Law Commission’s proposed reforms had been “largely implemented” in the 2003 Act. For example, the 2003 Act had included in section 114 a more general discretion to admit hearsay when it was “in the interests of justice” than the Law Commission had envisaged (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). Moreover, even if the hearsay rule was in need of reform the common-law right of confrontation was not: the right enshrined the principle that a person could not offer testimony against a criminal defendant unless it was given under oath, face-to-face with the defendant and subject to cross-examination.\n115: The Supreme Court had also been wrong to suggest that there was no justification for imposing the sole or decisive rule equally on continental and common-law jurisdictions. The Supreme Court had placed too much faith in the possibility of counterbalancing measures as a means of overcoming the manifest unfairness of convicting a person wholly or largely on the basis of unchallenged testimony. The essence of the common-law right of confrontation lay in the insight that cross-examination was the most effective way of establishing the reliability of a witness’s evidence. It was instructive to remember the warning of Megarry J (in John v. Rees [1970] Ch 345) that “the path of the law [was] strewn about with examples of open and shut cases which, somehow, were not; of unanswerable charges which, in the event, were completely answered”. In addition, JUSTICE submitted that it was, as Sedley LJ had observed in Secretary of State for the Home Department v. AF and others [2008] EWCA Civ 1148, “seductively easy to conclude that there can be no answer to a case of which you have only heard one side”. It was for this reason that the paradox referred to by Lord Phillips was not a paradox at all. Hearsay did not become more cogent simply because it might be the sole or substantive evidence of a person’s guilt. The need for the exclusion of apparently “decisive” hearsay evidence was justified by the centuries-old fear of common-law judges that juries might give it undue weight.\n116: The sole or decisive rule was not difficult to apply in English criminal procedure as trial judges already had to consider the potential consequences of admitting evidence in various statutes, including parts of the 2003 Act. Section 125(1), for example, obligated a trial judge to direct an acquittal where the case against an accused was based “wholly or partly” on unconvincing hearsay. JUSTICE accepted that some clarification of what was meant by “decisive” was required but considered that the test was still workable and indeed had been applied in England and Wales in the context of witness anonymity orders (see the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 at paragraph 46 above). In the context of criminal proceedings, “decisive” should be understood narrowly: it should not mean merely “capable of making a difference” but instead “likely to be determinative or conclusive”.\n117: Finally, the Supreme Court’s analysis of comparative law was, at best, a partial one. On the available evidence (see, inter alia, paragraphs 6387 above), it was simply not possible to conclude, as the Supreme Court had, that other common-law jurisdictions would find a criminal conviction which was based solely or decisively on hearsay evidence to be compatible with the right to a fair trial.\n118: The Court notes that the guarantees in paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of this provision which must be taken into account in any assessment of the fairness of proceedings. In addition, the Court’s primary concern under Article 6 § 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see, as a recent authority, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, § 84, ECHR 2010, with further references therein). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victims that crime is properly prosecuted (see Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 175, ECHR 2010) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, among many authorities, Doorson, cited above, § 70). It is also observed in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court’s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see Gäfgen, cited above, § 162, and the references therein).\n119: Having regard to the Court’s case-law, there are two requirements which follow from the above general principle. Firstly, there must be a good reason for the non-attendance of a witness. Secondly, when a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may be restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (the so-called “sole or decisive rule”). The Court will examine below whether the latter rule is to be considered as an absolute rule the breach of which automatically leads to a finding that the proceedings have not been fair in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n120: The requirement that there be a good reason for admitting the evidence of an absent witness is a preliminary question which must be examined before any consideration is given as to whether that evidence was sole or decisive. Even where the evidence of an absent witness has not been sole or decisive, the Court has still found a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) when no good reason has been shown for the failure to have the witness examined (see, for example, Lüdi v. Switzerland, 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238; Mild and Virtanen v. Finland, nos. 39481/98 and 40227/98, 26 July 2005; Bonev v. Bulgaria, no. 60018/00, 8 June 2006; and Pello v. Estonia, no. 11423/03, 12 April 2007). As a general rule, witnesses should give evidence during the trial and all reasonable efforts will be made to secure their attendance. Thus, when witnesses do not attend to give live evidence, there is a duty to enquire whether that absence is justified. There are a number of reasons why a witness may not attend trial but, in the present cases, it is only necessary to consider absence owing to death or fear.\n121: It is plain that, where a witness has died, in order for his or her evidence to be taken into account, it will be necessary to adduce his or her witness statement (see, for example, Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy, 7 August 1996, § 52, Reports 1996III, and Mika v. Sweden (dec.), no. 31243/06, § 37, 27 January 2009).\n122: Absence owing to fear calls for closer examination. A distinction must be drawn between two types of fear: fear which is attributable to threats or other actions of the defendant or those acting on his or her behalf and fear which is attributable to a more general fear of what will happen if the witness gives evidence at trial.\n123: When a witness’s fear is attributable to the defendant or those acting on his behalf, it is appropriate to allow the evidence of that witness to be introduced at trial without the need for the witness to give live evidence or be examined by the defendant or his representatives – even if such evidence was the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant. To allow the defendant to benefit from the fear he has engendered in witnesses would be incompatible with the rights of victims and witnesses. No court could be expected to allow the integrity of its proceedings to be subverted in this way. Consequently, a defendant who has acted in this manner must be taken to have waived his rights to question such witnesses under Article 6 § 3 (d). The same conclusion must apply when the threats or actions which lead to the witness being afraid to testify come from those who act on behalf of the defendant or with his knowledge and approval.\n124: The Court’s own case-law shows that it is more common for witnesses to have a general fear of testifying without that fear being directly attributable to threats made by the defendant or his agents. For instance, in many cases, the fear has been attributable to the notoriety of a defendant or his associates (see, for example, Dzelili v. Germany (dec.), no. 15065/05, 29 September 2009). There is, therefore, no requirement that a witness’s fear be attributable directly to threats made by the defendant in order for that witness to be excused from giving evidence at trial. Moreover, fear of death or injury of another person or of financial loss are all relevant considerations in determining whether a witness should not be required to give oral evidence. This does not mean, however, that any subjective fear of the witness will suffice. The trial court must conduct appropriate enquiries to determine, firstly, whether or not there are objective grounds for that fear, and, secondly, whether those objective grounds are supported by evidence (see, for example, Krasniki v. the , no. 51277/99, §§ 80-83, 28 February 2006, where the Court was not satisfied that the domestic courts had carried out an examination of the reasons for the witnesses’ fear before granting them anonymity).\n125: Finally, given the extent to which the absence of a witness adversely affects the rights of the defence, the Court would emphasise that, when a witness has not been examined at any prior stage of the proceedings, allowing the admission of a witness statement in lieu of live evidence at trial must be a measure of last resort. Before a witness can be excused from testifying on grounds of fear, the trial court must be satisfied that all available alternatives, such as witness anonymity and other special measures, would be inappropriate or impracticable.\n126: The Court notes that the present cases concern only absent witnesses whose statements were read at trial. It is not the Court’s task to consider the operation of the common-law rule against hearsay in abstracto or to consider generally whether the exceptions to that rule which now exist in English criminal law are compatible with the Convention. As the Court has reiterated (at paragraph 118 above), Article 6 does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law.\n127: The Court further observes that, in the present cases, it is not concerned with testimony that is given at trial by witnesses whose identity is concealed from the accused (anonymous testimony). While the problems raised by anonymous and absent witnesses are not identical, the two situations are not different in principle, since, as was acknowledged by the Supreme Court, each results in a potential disadvantage for the defendant. The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. This principle requires not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings.\n128: The seeds of the sole or decisive rule are to be found in Unterpertinger v. Austria (24 November 1986, § 33, Series A no. 110), which also provides the rationale for the test to be applied: if the conviction of a defendant is solely or mainly based on evidence provided by witnesses whom the accused is unable to question at any stage of the proceedings, his defence rights are unduly restricted. As was pointed out by the Supreme Court, in the earlier case-law of the Court, where the rule had been adumbrated in cases of absent or anonymous witnesses, the violation found of Article 6 § 3 (d) had been based at least in part on the fact that there was no justification for not calling or identifying the witness in question. It was in Doorson (cited above) that the Court first held that, even in a case where there was a justification for the failure to call a witness, a conviction based solely or to a decisive extent on evidence of that witness would be unfair.\n129: Drawing on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Horncastle and others, the Government challenge the sole or decisive rule, or its application by the Chamber in the present cases, on four principal grounds.\n130: As to the first argument, the Court accepts that the sole or decisive rule may have been developed in the context of legal systems which permitted a defendant to be convicted on evidence of witnesses whom he did not have an opportunity to challenge, a situation which would not have arisen if the strict common-law rule against hearsay evidence had been applied. However, the Court notes that the present cases have arisen precisely because the legal system in England and Wales has abandoned the strict common-law rule against hearsay evidence. Exceptions to the rule have been created, notably in the 1988 and 2003 Acts, which allowed for the admission of S.T.’s statement in the Al-Khawaja case and T.’s statement in the Tahery case (see paragraphs 41 and 44 above). The Court recognises that these dilutions of the strict rule against hearsay have been accompanied by statutory safeguards and, accordingly, the central question in the present cases is whether the application of these safeguards was sufficient to secure the applicants’ rights under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). Against this background, while it is important for the Court to have regard to substantial differences in legal systems and procedures, including different approaches to the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials, ultimately it must apply the same standard of review under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d), irrespective of the legal system from which a case emanates.\n131: Secondly, as to the alleged lack of precision of the rule, the Court notes that the word “sole”, in the sense of the only evidence against an accused (see, for example, Saïdi v. France, 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261C), does not appear to have given rise to difficulties, the principal criticism being directed to the word “decisive”. “Decisive” (or “déterminante”) in this context means more than “probative”. It further means more than that, without the evidence, the chances of a conviction would recede and the chances of an acquittal advance, a test which, as the Court of Appeal in Horncastle and others pointed out (see paragraph 54 above), would mean that virtually all evidence would qualify. Instead, the word “decisive” should be narrowly understood as indicating evidence of such significance or importance as is likely to be determinative of the outcome of the case. Where the untested evidence of a witness is supported by other corroborative evidence, the assessment of whether it is decisive will depend on the strength of the supportive evidence; the stronger the corroborative evidence, the less likely that the evidence of the absent witness will be treated as decisive.\n132: It is also argued that the sole or decisive rule cannot be applied without excessive practical difficulties in a common-law system. In Horncastle and others, the Supreme Court observed that a duty not to treat a particular piece of evidence as decisive was hard enough for a professional judge to discharge, but that if the rule were to be applied in the context of a jury trial the only practical way to apply it would be as a rule of admissibility: the trial judge would have to rule inadmissible any witness statement capable of proving decisive, which would be no easy task. As for the Court of Appeal or the , it was said that it would often be impossible to decide whether a particular statement was the sole or decisive basis of a conviction in the absence of reasons being given for a jury’s verdict.\n133: The Court accepts that it might be difficult for a trial judge in advance of a trial to determine whether evidence would be decisive without having the advantage of examining and weighing in the balance the totality of evidence that has been adduced in the course of the trial.\n134: However, once the prosecution has concluded its case, the significance and weight of the untested evidence can be assessed by the trial judge against the background of the other evidence against the accused. In common-law systems, at the conclusion of the prosecution case, trial judges are frequently asked to consider whether there is a case to answer against the accused. As part of that process they are often asked to assess the strength and reliability of the evidence for the prosecution. Indeed, the Court notes that section 125 of the 2003 Act expressly requires the trial judge to stop the case if, considering its importance to the case against the defendant, the hearsay evidence is so unconvincing that a conviction would be unsafe.\n135: The Court is further not persuaded that an appellate court in a common-law system, where a jury gives no reasons for its verdict, will be unable to determine whether untested evidence was the sole or decisive evidence in the conviction of the defendant. Appellate judges are commonly required to consider whether evidence was improperly admitted at trial and, if it was, whether the conviction is still safe. In doing so, they must consider, inter alia, the significance of the impugned evidence to the prosecution’s case and the extent to which it prejudiced the rights of the defence. An appellate court is thus well placed to consider whether untested evidence could be considered to be the sole or decisive evidence against the accused and whether the proceedings as a whole were fair.\n136: The Court observes that the comparative materials before it support this conclusion as regards the application of the rule in different common-law jurisdictions (see paragraphs 63-87 above and, in particular, the approach of the Scottish High Court of Justiciary).\n137: The Court also notes in this context that, in the case of R. v. Davis (see paragraphs 49 and 50 above), the House of Lords appeared to foresee no apparent difficulty in the application of the sole or decisive rule in the context of anonymous witnesses. Lord Bingham observed that a conviction which was based solely or to a decisive extent on statements or testimony of anonymous witnesses resulted from a trial which could not be regarded as fair and that “this [was] the view traditionally taken by the common-law of England” (see paragraph 25 of the  judgment). The House of Lords concluded in the  case that not only had the evidence of the anonymous witness been the sole or decisive basis on which the defendant could have been convicted but that effective cross-examination had been hampered. The decision in the Davis case led to the introduction into the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 of the very requirement that, in deciding whether to make a witness anonymity order, a judge must have regard, inter alia, to whether evidence given by the witness might be the sole or decisive evidence implicating the defendant (see paragraph 46 above).\n138: The Court further notes in this regard that, in the context of the drawing of adverse inferences from a defendant’s silence, the Court has applied the rule that it would be incompatible with the right to silence to base a conviction solely or mainly on the accused’s silence or on a refusal to answer questions or to give evidence himself (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, § 47, Reports 1996I, and Condron v. the United Kingdom, no. 35718/97, § 56, ECHR 2000V).\n139: The Court similarly cannot accept the third argument that the sole or decisive rule is predicated on the assumption that all hearsay evidence which is crucial to a case is unreliable or incapable of proper assessment unless tested in cross-examination. Rather, it is predicated on the principle that the greater the importance of the evidence, the greater the potential unfairness to the defendant in allowing the witness to remain anonymous or to be absent from the trial and the greater the need for safeguards to ensure that the evidence is demonstrably reliable or that its reliability can properly be tested and assessed.\n140: In Kostovski v. the Netherlands (20 November 1989, § 42, Series A no. 166), where it was accepted that the applicant’s conviction was based to a decisive extent on the evidence of both anonymous and absent witnesses, the Court emphasised:\n141: In the subsequent Doorson case (cited above, § 72), the Court observed that the anonymity of two witnesses in the case presented the defence with “difficulties which criminal proceedings should not normally involve” but that no violation could be found if the handicaps under which the defence laboured were sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed. It then considered that, in contrast to Kostovski (cited above), the defence was able to challenge the reliability of the anonymous witnesses (see Doorson, §§ 73 and 75). Moreover, even after its statement that a conviction should not be based either solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous witnesses, the Court emphasised that “evidence obtained from witnesses under conditions in which the rights of the defence cannot be secured to the extent normally required by the Convention should be treated with extreme care” (ibid., § 76).\n142: With respect to the Government’s final argument, the Court is of the view that the two reasons underpinning the sole or decisive rule that were set out in the Doorson judgment remain valid. For the first, the Court finds no reason to depart from its finding in Kostovski that inculpatory evidence against an accused may well be “designedly untruthful or simply erroneous”. Moreover, unsworn statements by witnesses who cannot be examined often appear on their face to be cogent and compelling and it is, as Lord Justice Sedley pointed out, “seductively easy” to conclude that there can be no answer to the case against the defendant (see paragraph 115 above). Experience shows that the reliability of evidence, including evidence which appears cogent and convincing, may look very different when subjected to a searching examination. The dangers inherent in allowing untested hearsay evidence to be adduced are all the greater if that evidence is the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant. As to the second reason, the defendant must not be placed in the position where he is effectively deprived of a real chance of defending himself by being unable to challenge the case against him. Trial proceedings must ensure that a defendant’s Article 6 rights are not unacceptably restricted and that he or she remains able to participate effectively in the proceedings (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, § 83, 16 December 1999, and Stanford v. the United Kingdom, 23 February 1994, § 26, Series A no. 282A). The Court’s assessment of whether a criminal trial has been fair cannot depend solely on whether the evidence against the accused appears prima facie to be reliable, if there are no means of challenging that evidence once it is admitted.\n143: For these reasons, the Court has consistently assessed the impact that the defendant’s inability to examine a witness has had on the overall fairness of his trial. It has always considered it necessary to examine the significance of the untested evidence in order to determine whether the defendant’s rights have been unacceptably restricted (see, as early examples, Unterpertinger, cited above, and Bricmont v. Belgium, 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158; and, more recently, Kornev and Karpenko v. Ukraine, no. 17444/04, §§ 54-57, 21 October 2010; Caka v. Albania, no. 44023/02, §§ 112-16, 8 December 2009; Guilloury v. France, no. 62236/00, §§ 57-62, 22 June 2006; and A.M. v. Italy; Krasniki; Lucà; and Saïdi, all cited above).\n144: Traditionally, when examining complaints under Article 6 § 1, the Court has carried out its examination of the overall fairness of the proceedings by having regard to such factors as the way in which statutory safeguards have been applied, the extent to which procedural opportunities were afforded to the defence to counter handicaps that it laboured under and the manner in which the proceedings as a whole have been conducted by the trial judge (see, for example, John Murray, cited above).\n145: Also, in cases concerning the withholding of evidence from the defence in order to protect police sources, the Court has left it to the domestic courts to decide whether the rights of the defence should cede to the public interest and has confined itself to verifying whether the procedures followed by the judicial authorities sufficiently counterbalance the limitations on the defence with appropriate safeguards. The fact that certain evidence was not made available to the defence was not considered automatically to lead to a violation of Article 6 § 1 (see, for example, Rowe and Davis v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28901/95, ECHR 2000II). Similarly, in Salduz (cited above, § 50), the Court reiterated that the right to legal assistance, set out in Article 6 § 3 (c) was one element, among others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in Article 6 § 1.\n146: The Court is of the view that the sole or decisive rule should also be applied in a similar manner. It would not be correct, when reviewing questions of fairness, to apply this rule in an inflexible manner. Nor would it be correct for the Court to ignore entirely the specificities of the particular legal system concerned and, in particular its rules of evidence, notwithstanding judicial dicta that may have suggested otherwise (see, for instance, Lucà, cited above, § 40). To do so would transform the rule into a blunt and indiscriminate instrument that runs counter to the traditional way in which the Court approaches the issue of the overall fairness of the proceedings, namely to weigh in the balance the competing interests of the defence, the victim, and witnesses, and the public interest in the effective administration of justice.\n147: The Court therefore concludes that, where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission as evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 § 1. At the same time, where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. Because of the dangers of the admission of such evidence, it would constitute a very important factor to balance in the scales, to use the words of Lord Mance in R. v. Davis (see paragraph 50 above), and one which would require sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance in the case.\n148: The Court will therefore examine the counterbalancing measures in place in English law at the relevant time. The Court observes that under the terms of the 1988 and 2003 Acts the absence of witnesses must be justified and fall within one of the defined categories (see section 23 of the 1988 Act and section 116 of the 2003 Act at paragraphs 41 and 44 above). Whatever the reasons for the absence of a witness, the admission of statements of a witness who is not only absent but anonymous is not admissible.\n149: The 2003 Act also provides that, whatever the reason for the absence of a witness, evidence relevant to the credibility or consistency of the maker of the statement may be admitted even where the evidence would not have been admissible had the witness given evidence in person. The trial judge retains a specific discretion to refuse to admit a hearsay statement if satisfied that the case for its exclusion substantially outweighs the case for admitting it. Of particular significance is the requirement under the 2003 Act that the trial judge should stop the proceedings if satisfied at the close of the case for the prosecution that the case against the accused is based “wholly or partly” on a hearsay statement admitted under the 2003 Act, provided he or she is also satisfied that the statement in question is so unconvincing that, considering its importance to the case against the accused, a conviction would be unsafe.\n150: The Court also notes that, in addition to the safeguards contained in each Act, section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides a general discretion to exclude evidence if its admission would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the trial that it ought not to be admitted. Finally, the common law requires a trial judge to give the jury the traditional direction on the burden of proof, and direct them as to the dangers of relying on a hearsay statement.\n151: The Court considers that the safeguards contained in the 1988 and 2003 Acts, supported by those contained in section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and the common law, are, in principle, strong safeguards designed to ensure fairness. It remains to be examined how these safeguards were applied in the present cases.\n152: In turning to the present cases, the Court begins by observing that, in the course of the hearing before the Grand Chamber, a question was put to the parties as to whether it was accepted that the testimony of S.T. was the sole or decisive evidence in respect of Mr Al-Khawaja and that the testimony of T. was the sole or decisive evidence in respect of Mr Tahery. In reply to that question, the Government departed from the position they had taken before the Chamber and submitted that neither S.T. nor T.’s testimony was sole or decisive (see paragraphs 104 and 105 above). The Court will therefore consider three issues in each case: firstly, whether it was necessary to admit the witness statements of S.T. or T.; secondly, whether their untested evidence was the sole or decisive basis for each applicant’s conviction; and thirdly, whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors including strong procedural safeguards to ensure that each trial, judged as a whole, was fair within the meaning of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d).\n153: The Court observes that it is not in dispute that S.T.’s death made it necessary to admit her witness statement if her evidence was to be considered.\n154: Notwithstanding the Government’s submission that S.T.’s statement was not sole or decisive because there was other evidence supporting it, the Court notes that the judge who admitted S.T.’s statement was well placed to evaluate its significance. He was quite clear when he observed “no statement, no count one” (see paragraph 13 above). It is not for the Court, so far removed from the trial proceedings, to gainsay such an evaluation. The Court is therefore compelled to conclude that S.T.’s statement was decisive.\n155: Nevertheless, as the Court has indicated (see paragraph 147 above) the admission of the statement in evidence cannot be considered as conclusive as to the unfairness of the trial, but as a very important factor to be placed in the balance alongside the procedural safeguards noted above and other counterbalancing factors present in the case.\n156: The interests of justice were obviously in favour of admitting in evidence the statement of S.T., which was recorded by the police in proper form. The reliability of the evidence was supported by the fact that S.T. had made her complaint to two friends, B.F. and S.H., promptly after the events in question, and that there were only minor inconsistencies between her statement and the account given by her to the two friends, who both gave evidence at the trial. Most importantly, there were strong similarities between S.T.’s description of the alleged assault and that of the other complainant, V.U., with whom there was no evidence of any collusion. In a case of indecent assault by a doctor on his patient, which took place during a private consultation where only he and the victim were present, it would be difficult to conceive of stronger corroborative evidence, especially when each of the other witnesses was called to give evidence at trial and their reliability was tested by cross-examination.\n157: It is true that the judge’s direction to the jury was found to be deficient by the Court of Appeal. However, the Court of Appeal also held that it must have been clear to the jury from that direction that, in consequence of the applicant’s inability to cross-examine S.T. and the fact that they were unable to see and hear her, her statement should carry less weight with them (see paragraph 22 above). Having regard to this direction, and the evidence offered by the prosecution in support of S.T.’s statement, the Court considers that the jury was able to conduct a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of S.T.’s allegations against the first applicant.\n158: Against this background, and viewing the fairness of the proceedings as a whole, the Court considers that, notwithstanding the difficulties caused to the defence by admitting the statement and the dangers of doing so, there were sufficient counterbalancing factors to conclude that the admission in evidence of S.T.’s statement did not result in a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d).\n159: The Court considers that appropriate enquiries were made to determine whether there were objective grounds for T.’s fear. The trial judge heard evidence from both T. and a police officer as to that fear. The trial judge was also satisfied that special measures, such as testifying behind a screen, would not allay T.’s fears. Even though T.’s identity as the maker of the incriminating statement was publicly disclosed, the conclusion of the trial judge that T. had a genuine fear of giving oral evidence and was not prepared to do so even if special measures were introduced in the trial proceedings provides a sufficient justification for admitting T.’s statement.\n160: The Court notes that when those present at the scene of the stabbing were originally interviewed, no one claimed to have seen the applicant stab S, and S himself had not seen who had stabbed him, although initially he presumed it was the second applicant. T. had made his statement implicating the applicant two days after the event. He was the only witness who had claimed to see the stabbing. His uncorroborated eyewitness statement was, if not the sole, at least the decisive evidence against the applicant for that reason. It was obviously evidence of great weight and without it the chances of a conviction would have significantly receded. Even though the testimony may have been coherent and convincing on its face it cannot be said to belong to the category of evidence that can be described as “demonstrably reliable” such as a dying declaration or other examples given by the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in their Horncastle and others judgments (see paragraphs 53 and 60 above).\n161: Such untested evidence weighs heavily in the balance and requires sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for the consequential difficulties caused to the defence by its admission. Reliance is placed by the Government on two main counterbalancing factors: the fact that the trial judge concluded that no unfairness would be caused by the admission of T.’s statement since the applicant was in a position to challenge or rebut the statement by giving evidence himself or calling other witnesses who were present, one of whom was his uncle; and the warning given by the trial judge to the jury that it was necessary to approach the evidence given by the absent witness with care.\n162: However, the Court considers that neither of these factors, whether taken alone or in combination, could be a sufficient counterbalance to the handicap under which the defence laboured. Even if he gave evidence denying the charge, the applicant was, of course, unable to test the truthfulness and reliability of T.’s evidence by means of cross-examination. The fact is that T. was the sole witness who was apparently willing or able to say what he had seen. The defence was not able to call any other witness to contradict the testimony provided in the hearsay statement.\n163: The other evidence was that given by the victim S who did not know who had stabbed him, although initially he presumed it was the applicant. His evidence was circumstantial in nature and largely uncontested by the applicant. He gave evidence of the fight and the applicant’s actions after the stabbing (see paragraph 32 above). While this evidence corroborated some of the details of T.’s testimony, it could only provide at best indirect support for the claim by T. that it was the applicant who had stabbed S.\n164: It is true that the direction in the judge’s summing up to the jury was both full and carefully phrased, drawing attention to the dangers of relying on untested evidence. However, the Court does not consider that such a warning, however clearly or forcibly expressed, could be a sufficient counterbalance where an untested statement of the only prosecution eyewitness was the only direct evidence against the applicant.\n165: The Court therefore considers that the decisive nature of T.’s statement in the absence of any strong corroborative evidence in the case meant the jury in this case was unable to conduct a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of T.’s evidence. Examining the fairness of the proceedings as a whole, the Court concludes that there were not sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for the difficulties to the defence which resulted from the admission of T.’s statement. It therefore finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d) in respect of Mr Tahery.\n166: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n167: As no violation has been found in respect of the first applicant, just satisfaction need only be considered in respect of the second applicant.\n168: The second applicant maintained his submission that, unlike the majority of Article 6 cases, it could properly be said that his conviction for the offence in question and his subsequent sentence of imprisonment would not have occurred had it not been for the violation. Based on the additional time he served in prison and with reference to comparable domestic awards for unlawful detention, the second applicant claimed 65,000 pounds sterling (GBP) (approximately 83,830 euros (EUR)). The Government maintained their submissions that there was no causal connection between the alleged violation and the conviction of the applicant, that domestic case-law was of limited relevance and that any finding of a violation amounted to sufficient just satisfaction. Alternatively, a much lower sum, such as the EUR 6,000 awarded in Visser v. the Netherlands (no. 26668/95, § 56, 14 February 2002), would be appropriate.\n169: In its judgment, the Chamber accepted that domestic case-law was of limited relevance to the question of non-pecuniary damage in proceedings before it. It found, however, that the criminal proceedings against the second applicant, at least in respect of the charge which was based on T.’s statement, was not conducted in conformity with the Convention and that the applicant had inevitably suffered a degree of distress and anxiety as a result. It awarded the sum of EUR 6,000 by way of compensation for non-pecuniary damage.\n170: The Grand Chamber sees no reason to depart from the Chamber’s assessment and accordingly makes the same award of EUR 6,000.\n171: Before the Chamber, the second applicant claimed a total of GBP 7,995 for costs and expenses, which is approximately EUR 9,079. This comprised GBP 5,571.47 (inclusive of value-added tax (VAT)) for approximately 45 hours’ work by Ms Trowler, which included attendance at the Chamber hearing and travelling time to Strasbourg. Solicitor’s costs and expenses were GBP 2,423.56 (inclusive of VAT) which covered costs of GBP 1,734.16 for approximately 15 hours’ work and GBP 689.40 in expenses.\n172: Before the Grand Chamber, the second applicant claimed a total of GBP 3,614.82 in respect of solicitor’s costs and expenses, which covered the proceedings before the Chamber and the Grand Chamber. He also claimed an additional GBP 3,643 (inclusive of VAT) for a further 37 hours’ work by Ms Trowler. This included 17 hours’ work to cover her anticipated attendance at the Grand Chamber hearing and travelling time to Strasbourg. She was, in the event, unable to attend the hearing.\n173: The Government considered the hourly rates which had been charged to be excessive.\n174: The Court finds that the amounts claimed are not excessive in the light of the complexity of the case. Thus, with the exception of the 17 hours’ attendance and travelling time to the Grand Chamber hearing (which were not actually incurred), the remainder of the second applicant’s costs and expenses should be met in full. It therefore awards EUR 13,150, inclusive of VAT, less EUR 1,150 already received in legal aid from the Council of Europe, to be converted into pounds sterling on the date of settlement.\n175: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

                "CASE OF HUMMER v. GERMANY; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 26171/07) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mr Lars Hümmer (“the applicant”), on 3 May 2007.\n2: The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr T. Guber, a lawyer practising in . The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Deputy Agent, Mr H.-J. Behrens, Ministerialrat, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n3: The applicant alleged that he had not been able at any stage of the criminal proceedings instituted against him to question the main witnesses on whose testimonies the domestic court had based its order to place him in a psychiatric hospital, in breach of his right to a fair trial pursuant to Article 6 §§ 1 as well as 3 (d) of the Convention.\n4: The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits of the application.\n5: By a decision of 8 June 2010, the Court declared the application admissible.\n6: The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in . At the time of the events in issue in September 2003 he was living in Bingen, Rhineland-Palatinate, where he was studying mechanical engineering.\n7: On 26 November 2003 the applicant’s mother, his brother and his sister (“the witnesses”) informed the police about an incident that had occurred during the night of 2-3 September 2003 at the applicant’s parents’ house in . The witnesses testified that the applicant, who cannot remember the incident, had strangled his sister and had attacked his brother with an axe before being overpowered by his parents. The applicant’s father did not press criminal charges and did not testify against the applicant.\n8: The Coburg Public Prosecutor opened a criminal investigation against the applicant for attempted murder. On 8 December 2003 the witnesses repeated their statements before the investigating judge (Ermittlungsrichter) of the Kronach District Court in the presence of a police officer. The applicant was not informed of the hearing before the investigating judge. No counsel was appointed for him.\n9: On 16 December 2003 the Kronach District Court issued a warrant for the applicant’s arrest. The applicant was arrested on 19 December 2003 and remanded in custody. By a decision of the Coburg Regional Court of 6 October 2004 the applicant was transferred to a psychiatric hospital pending trial.\n10: On 28 February 2005 the Coburg Regional Court ordered that the applicant be placed in a psychiatric hospital pursuant to section 63 of the Criminal Code (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below).\n11: The  qualified the acts as two counts of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm (gefährliche Körperverletzung). It further held on the basis of expert opinions that the applicant had acted either in a state of diminished awareness of his actions due to epilepsy (epileptischer Dämmerzustand) or during a bout of paranoid schizophrenia and could therefore not be held responsible for the acts, pursuant to section 20 of the Criminal Code (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below).\n12: As regards the finding of facts, the Regional Court noted that the applicant did not have any recollection of the events in the night of 23 September 2003 and that the only available direct witnesses, namely the applicant’s mother, brother and sister, had availed themselves of their right not to testify against the applicant in court pursuant to section 52 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below). The applicant’s father had refrained from pressing criminal charges and had not participated in the proceedings (see above § 7). The facts could nevertheless be established on the basis of the testimony of the investigating judge, who had heard the witnesses on 8 December 2003 and had given an account of their pre-trial statements in court. The  held that it was not prevented from hearing the investigating judge as a witness and taking his testimony about the witnesses’ pre-trial statements into account.\n13: The Regional Court noted that the Public Prosecutor had failed to request the appointment of counsel for the applicant prior to the hearing of the witnesses by the investigating judge in accordance with section 140 (1) no. 2 read in conjunction with section 141 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure as construed by the Federal Court of Justice in the light of the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention. Furthermore, the unrepresented applicant had not been informed about the hearing before the investigating judge pursuant to section 168(c) (3) and (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and there would have been no grounds to exclude a potential counsel from the hearing (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below).\n14: The  reiterated that under the Federal Court of Justice’s case-law the failure to appoint counsel did not compel the exclusion of the investigating judge’s testimony. However, the  was bound to proceed to a particularly critical assessment of the investigating judge’s testimony in view of the fact that neither the accused nor counsel had been able to directly examine the witnesses. The finding of facts could only be based on the investigating judge’s testimony if the latter was corroborated by other significant considerations.\n15: The  took several items of evidence as corroborating the investigating judge’s testimony into account. Firstly, it emphasised that for its establishment of facts it not only disposed of the testimony by the investigating judge but also of three consistent witness statements that gave a coherent account of the events in issue. According to the testimony given by the investigating judge, there was nothing to establish that the witnesses had not told the truth or wanted to incriminate the applicant; the witnesses had testified because they had been concerned about the applicant’s health and had feared another attack by him. Furthermore, the police superintendent who had registered the witnesses’ criminal charge on 26 November 2011 had testified that on this occasion he had been spontaneously told by the witnesses - prior to their subsequent questioning - that the applicant had attacked members of his family with an axe. The  pointed out that as opposed to the witnesses’ subsequent testimonies to the police, these spontaneous statements did not have to be excluded from the trial pursuant to section 252 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but constituted admissible evidence. In addition, another policeman had testified that the applicant’s mother had called him spontaneously on 3 December 2003 and had asked what further action would be taken as a result of the criminal complaint with a view to preventing a renewed unannounced visit and attack by the applicant. In the ’s view these spontaneous statements supported the witnesses’ description of the events in the night of 2-3 September 2003.\n16: The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law in which he complained that the investigating judge’s testimony ought to have been excluded from the trial.\n17: The Coburg Public Prosecutor lodged an appeal on points of law in which he argued that the attack on the witnesses should have been classified as two counts of attempted manslaughter as well as assault occasioning grievous bodily harm.\n18: On 25 May 2005 the Federal Public Prosecutor moved that the applicant’s appeal on points of law be dismissed on the grounds that the Regional Court had, in line with the reasoning in the related Federal Court of Justice’s leading judgment, established that the investigating judge’s testimony had been corroborated by other important considerations and that the Regional Court’s holding was free of error.\n19: On 24 August 2005 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as ill-founded. On 31 August 2005 the Federal Court of Justice ordered the State to pay the costs of the Public Prosecutor’s Appeal on points of law which had been withdrawn. These decisions were served on the applicant on 9 and 16 September 2005 respectively.\n20: On 1 April 2006 the applicant lodged his first application with this Court (no. 14678/06) which was declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies by a Committee of three judges on 5 September 2006.\n21: On 16 October 2006 the applicant applied for the reinstatement of the proceedings in regard to his compliance with the one-month period to lodge a constitutional complaint and submitted his constitutional complaint to the .\n22: On 20 March 2007 the  refused to admit the applicant’s constitutional complaint for examination and noted that there was no need to decide the applicant’s application for the reinstatement of the proceedings (no. 2 BvR 225/07).\n23: The Regional Court may order an accused to be placed in a psychiatric hospital if he has committed an unlawful act in a state that excludes a finding of guilt, and if his act reveals that as a result of his condition, future serious unlawful acts can be expected of him and that he therefore presents a danger to the general public (section 63 of the Criminal Code). An accused acts without guilt if he is incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act or of acting in accordance with such appreciation due to a pathological emotional disorder, profound consciousness disorder, mental defect or any other serious emotional abnormality (section 20 of the Criminal Code).\n24: Pursuant to section 168(c) (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the prosecutor, the accused and defence counsel shall be permitted to be present during the judicial examination of a witness or expert prior to the opening of the main proceedings. The judge may exclude an accused from being present at the hearing if his presence would endanger the purpose of the investigation, in particular if it is to be feared that a witness will not tell the truth in the presence of the accused (section 168(c) (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The persons entitled to be present shall be given prior notice of the dates set down for the hearings. The notification shall be dispensed with if it would endanger the success of the investigation (section 168(c) (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure).\n25: Defence counsel may be appointed during preliminary proceedings; the public prosecution office shall request such an appointment if in its opinion the assistance of defence counsel in the main proceedings will be mandatory (section 141 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The assistance of defence counsel is mandatory if, inter alia, the main hearing is held at first instance before the Regional Court, the accused is charged with a serious criminal offence, or the proceedings are conducted with a view to placement in a psychiatric hospital (section 140 (1) nos. 1, 2 and 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). Counsel is to be appointed when an indicted accused without defence counsel has been requested to reply to the bill of indictment (section 141 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure).\n26: In a leading judgment of 25 July 2000 (published in the official reports, BGHSt, volume 46, p. 96 et seq.) the Federal Court of Justice held that section 141 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure required, in view of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention, the appointment of counsel for an unrepresented accused if the key witness for the prosecution was to testify before an investigating judge and the accused was excluded from this hearing. The failure to appoint counsel prior to the hearing before the investigating judge did not exclude the latter’s testimony about the witnesses’ statements as long as the proceedings, seen as a whole, remained fair. To this end the investigating judge’s testimony had to be carefully assessed. A conviction could only be based on the investigating judge’s testimony if this testimony was corroborated by other important considerations.\n27: Parents, brothers and sisters need not testify against their accused son or daughter, brother or sister (section 52 (1) no. 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure); if such a witness makes use of his or her right not to testify at the main hearing, prior witness statements shall not be read out (section 252 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). According to the Federal Court of Justice’s case-law, section 252 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is an exclusionary rule that applies to all statements made prior to a main hearing by witnesses who avail themselves of their right not to testify at the main hearing, with the exceptions of spontaneous statements made by the witness before or outside his or her formal testimony as well as testimonies before a judge after the witness has been advised of his or her right not to testify.\n28: The applicant complained that neither he nor counsel were able to examine the main witnesses against him at any stage of the proceedings. He alleged that therefore his right to mount an effective defence had been unduly restricted. His right to a fair trial further had been breached by the trial court’s admission of the investigating judge’s account of the statements made by the witnesses at the pre-trial stage.\n29: The Government conceded that neither the applicant nor counsel had been able at any stage of the proceedings to question or to have questioned the applicant’s family members who were the only direct witnesses of the events at issue.\n30: They maintained that the fact that the applicant had not been notified of the hearing of the witnesses by the investigating judge in the course of the preliminary proceedings did, as such, not raise a problem. They nevertheless acknowledged that pursuant to section 141 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as construed by the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, counsel should have been appointed for the applicant at the pre-trial stage and be granted the opportunity to assist the hearing by the investigating judge and to question the witnesses. Since the witnesses had availed themselves of their statutory right not to testify on the occasion of the ensuing trial in accordance with section 52 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicant had been definitely deprived of an opportunity to examine them. The procedural error of not having appointed counsel already at the investigative stage had therefore also affected the fairness of the main proceedings.\n31: In the Government’s view the  had, however, sufficiently compensated the resulting restrictions for the defence in the course of the trial. In line with the related principles developed in the Federal Court of Justice’s case-law referring to Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention, the Regional Court had pointed out that the evidentiary value of the investigating judge’s testimony was reduced because of the applicant’s inability to question the main witnesses. Consequently, it had not based its findings of fact solely on the witnesses’ testimonies as introduced by the investigating judge but had taken other significant evidence into account. For instance, the court had made reference to the applicant’s account of the events following the assault on the morning of 3 September 2003 and the witnesses’ spontaneous statements made vis-à-vis the police officer who had recorded the criminal charges brought against the applicant on 26 November 2003 as well as the applicant’s mother’s enquiry of 3 December 2003 regarding the further steps taken by the police as a result of the criminal complaint. The  further had had regard to the injuries sustained by the applicant’s brother, the submissions of the doctor who had treated the applicant’s brother’s wounds in hospital and the corpus delicti handed over to the police by the latter. The Government also pointed out that the applicant as well as counsel had been in a position to observe the demeanour of the investigating judge as well as the aforementioned police officers and doctor when they were testifying in court and had the opportunity to question these witnesses. Thus, the defence had had the possibility to form their own impression of the latters’ credibility.\n32: The Government contended that the Regional Court had thoroughly and critically assessed these additional items of evidence which not only had their own independent evidentiary value and could therefore serve as a basis for the Regional Court’s decision but which also corroborated the investigating judge’s testimony. They therefore constituted a strong indication that the statements made by the witnesses in the course of the preliminary proceedings had been accurate. The applicant’s placement in a psychiatric hospital had therefore not been based solely or decisively on the statements of witnesses whom the applicant had been unable to question or have been questioned.\n33: Having regard to these considerations, the Government concluded that the criminal proceedings against the applicant as a whole had been fair and there had thus been no violation of Article 6 § 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.\n34: The applicant submitted that the Government had actually acknowledged that the applicant’s rights to examine witnesses against him had been infringed. The Government’s view that the resulting restrictions for the defence had been compensated by the ’s finding that the investigating judge’s testimony was of reduced evidentiary value and that the applicant’s conviction therefore had to be based on further significant evidence had no mooring in the text of the Convention or the Court’s case-law. In particular, the present case was not comparable to applications previously examined by the Court which related to situations where the identity or the whereabouts of a witness were unknown, thus making it impossible for the national authorities to arrange for an examination of the latter by defence counsel.\n35: The applicant further maintained that, contrary to the Government’s submissions, his placement in a psychiatric hospital had, in fact, been based solely on the statements of the key witnesses whom he had not had an opportunity to question. The corroborating evidence adduced by the  did not provide a sufficient basis for the court’s related order and a conviction based solely on corroborating evidence would not have been safe.\n36: For these reasons, the applicant concluded that the rights of the defence had been restricted to an extent which was irreconcilable with the guarantees contained in Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.\n37: The Court recalls that the guarantees in paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of this provision which must be taken into account in any assessment of the fairness of proceedings. In addition, the Court’s primary concern under Article 6 § 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see, as a recent authority, Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the  [GC], nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, §118, ECHR 2011, with further references therein). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victims that crime is properly prosecuted (see Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 175, ECHR 2010....) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, § 70, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II).\n38: Article 6 § 3 (d) enshrines the principle that, before an accused can be convicted, all evidence against him must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings (see Lucà v. , no. 33354/96, § 39, ECHR 2001II and Solakov v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, no. 47023/99, § 57, ECHR 2001X).\n39: The statement of a witness does not always have to be made in court and in public if it is to be admitted as evidence; in particular, this may prove impossible in certain cases (see Asch v. Austria, 26 April 1991, § 27, Series A no. 203). In any event, paragraph 1 of Article 6 taken together with paragraph 3 requires the Contracting States to take positive steps, in particular to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him. Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see D. v. Finland, no. 30542/04, § 41, 7 July 2009 and Sadak and Others v. Turkey, nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, § 67, ECHR 2001VIII).\n40: The Court further reiterates in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court’s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly and in particular whether the defendant’s rights have not been unacceptably restricted and that he or she remains able to participate effectively in the proceedings (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, § 83, 16 December 1999 and Stanford v. the United Kingdom, 23 February 1994, § 26, Series A no. 282A).\n41: The Court notes at the outset that, as also pointed out by the applicant, the present application does not concern witnesses whose identity or whereabouts are unknown to the accused. In the instant case the only available eye witnesses of the events in issue were the applicant’s mother, brother and sister (the applicant’s father having refrained from participating in the proceedings, see above §§ 7 and 12) who all refused to give evidence at the trial, as they were entitled to in their capacity as family members of the accused pursuant to section 52 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure. They could thus neither be heard by the trial court nor were the prosecution or the defence able to examine them during trial. The Court recalls in this context that provisions granting family members of the accused the right not to testify as witnesses in court with a view to avoiding their being put in a moral dilemma can be found in the domestic law of several member States of the Council of Europe and are, as such, not incompatible with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention (see Unterpertinger v. Austria, 24 November 1986, § 30, Series A no. 110).\n42: Furthermore, as concerns the fact that the Regional Court heard the investigating judge who gave an account of the witnesses’ pre-trial statements of 8 December 2003, the Court reiterates that the use in evidence of statements obtained at the investigative stage is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 3 (d) and 1 of Article 6, provided the defendant has been given an adequate opportunity to challenge the statements, either when made or at a later stage (see, among other authorities, Isgrò v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, § 34, Series A no. 194A; Lucà, cited above, § 40 and Gossa v. , no. 47986/99, § 54, 9 January 2007). This implies that the use made of evidence admitted by the trial court must comply with the rights of the defence, in particular, where the accused has not had an opportunity at any stage in the earlier proceedings to question the persons whose statements are introduced into the trial (see, mutatis mutandis, Unterpertinger, cited above, § 31) and where they form the sole or decisive evidence for a conviction or related decision by the trial court (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 119). The Court has held in this context that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may be restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (the so-called “sole or decisive rule”; ibid.).\n43: The Court notes that it is not disputed between the parties that the applicant did not have the opportunity to question his mother, brother and sister at trial. It is further not contested by the Government that the Public Prosecutor had failed to request the appointment of counsel prior to the witnesses’ hearing before the investigating judge in accordance with domestic law as construed by the Federal Court of Justice and that it thus had been imputable to the national authorities that defence counsel did not have an opportunity to examine the witnesses at the pre-trial stage.\n44: As regards the significance of the untested evidence for the trial, the Court accepts the Government’s submissions that the witnesses’ pre-trial statements of 8 December 2003, as introduced to the proceedings by the investigating judge’s testimony, were not the only evidence before the Regional Court. The court also referred, inter alia, to the witnesses’ statements made prior to their formal testimonies vis-à-vis the police officer who had recorded the criminal charges brought against the applicant on 26 November 2003 as well as the applicant’s mother’s enquiry of 3 December 2003 regarding the further steps taken by the police as a result of the criminal complaint. It further had regard to the injuries sustained by the applicant’s brother, the submissions of the doctor who had treated the applicant’s brother’s wounds and the corpus delicti handed over to the police by the latter. The Court notes, however, that such corroborating evidence was either hearsay itself or circumstantial and appears to have even increased the ’s reliance on the statements of the witnesses whom the applicant could not examine. As regards the applicant’s recollection of the events following the assault, the Court notes that this could at best provide indirect support for the claim that the applicant had attacked his sister and brother.\n45: The Court has emphasised in its recent case-law that, where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission at trial will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 § 1. At the same time the Court found that where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, it must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance in the case (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 147). The Court observes that similar considerations are reflected in the Regional Court’s judgment of 28 February 2005 stating, with reference to the Federal Court of Justice’s related case-law, that since neither the accused nor counsel had been able to examine the witnesses against the accused, the trial court was requested to assess the investigating judge’s testimony particularly critically and could only base its decision on such testimony if the latter was corroborated by other significant factors.\n46: The Court is therefore called upon to examine whether the  had put sufficient counterbalancing factors in place and had proceeded to a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of the available evidence. The Court observes that the counterbalancing factors relied on by the Government mainly include the fact that the trial court had taken the aforementioned corroborating evidence (see above § 44) into account in its decision-making. The Government further pointed out that the applicant as well as counsel had been in a position to observe the demeanour of the investigative judge as well as the aforementioned police officers and doctor when they had testified in court and had the opportunity to question these witnesses. In the Government’s view they had thus had the possibility to form their own impression of the latter’s credibility. Furthermore, according to the investigating judge’s testimony, there had been nothing to establish that the witnesses when questioned in the course of the investigation proceedings had not told the truth or wanted to incriminate the applicant.\n47: Having regard to these arguments and acknowledging that the trial court had been aware of the fact that the evidentiary value of the investigating judge’s testimony had to be carefully scrutinised, the Court will examine whether the factors adduced by the Government, taken alone or in combination, constituted a sufficient counterbalance to the handicap under which the defence laboured following the admission as evidence of the investigating judge’s account of the witnesses’ statements made at the pre-trial stage.\n48: The Court recalls in this context that counsel for the applicant had not been appointed prior to the witnesses’ hearing by the investigating judge in the preliminary proceedings, in breach of domestic law. The applicant had thus been deprived of a procedural safeguard afforded by national law as construed by the domestic courts with a view to granting the defence an opportunity to examine key witness for the prosecution at the pre-trial stage. The Court shares the Government’s view that this procedural error at the investigative stage has also affected the fairness of the main proceedings. It is, by contrast, not convinced by the Government’s argument that the  has sufficiently compensated the resulting restrictions for the defence in the course of the trial.\n49: As regards the evidence corroborating the witness statements as adduced by the Regional Court and as referred to by the Government, the Court reiterates its finding that such evidence did at best provide indirect support for the claim that the applicant had attacked his sister and brother and that the statements of the applicant’s family members provided the only conclusive evidence in this regard.\n50: The Court further observes that the statements of these witnesses and the circumstances under which they have been made were to some extent contradictory or at least incoherent. It notes, for instance, that the applicant’s brother, mother and sister pressed criminal charges against the applicant on 26 November 2003, almost three months after the incident had occurred. It is therefore questionable whether any statements made on that date or thereafter vis-à-vis the police officer can still be considered as being made spontaneously as assumed by the trial court. It is further not surprising that after such a considerable period of time the witnesses, having had ample opportunity to compare their recollection of the events, gave similar and coherent accounts of the alleged assault during their examination by the investigating judge. As regards the injuries sustained by the applicant’s brother, the Court notes that the latter himself had adduced vis-à-vis the doctor who had treated him in hospital on 2 September 2003 and who had subsequently testified at the applicant’s trial, that he had fallen through a glass pane. While this doctor, when examined at trial, expressed doubts as to the explanation given for the injuries, there is nothing in his testimony to establish that the injuries could in principle not have been caused by such an accident or that they had actually been caused by the axe that constituted the alleged corpus delicti. The Court further cannot but take note of the fact that even though the sister had undisputedly accompanied her brother to the hospital, she had not been examined by a doctor and no circumstantial evidence exists for any injuries, such as strangulation marks, sustained by her.\n51: These inconsistencies, which are not addressed in the ’s judgment of 28 February 2005, could neither be explored by the applicant nor by the trial court in cross-examination of the witnesses. Furthermore, neither the trial court nor the prosecution, the accused or counsel were in a position to observe the direct witnesses’ demeanour under questioning and to form their own impression of their probity and credibility. While the Court accepts the Government’s submissions that the applicant as well as counsel had been in a position to observe the demeanour of the investigative judge as well as the aforementioned police officers and doctor when testifying in court, it nevertheless is of the opinion that such possibility does not compensate for the lack of opportunity to test the truthfulness and reliability of the decisive evidence in the case at hand, namely the witnesses’ statements at the pre-trial stage.\n52: Having regard to the above considerations, the Court therefore finds that no adequate procedures were introduced by the authorities to counterbalance the difficulties faced by the defence and that there is nothing to establish that the applicant was given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the only direct witnesses against him. This appears even more evident when taking into account that the applicant himself, due to the epileptic seizure he had been suffering from, did undisputedly not have any recollection of the events in issue and was thus not even in a position of giving evidence denying the charge. The Court recalls in this respect that a defendant must not be placed in a position where he is effectively deprived of a real chance of defending himself by being unable to challenge the case against him (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], cited above, § 83 and Stanford v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 26).”\n53: The Court therefore considers that the decisive nature of the witnesses’ statements as introduced by the investigating judges’ testimony in the absence of any strong corroborative evidence meant that the trial court in the instant case was unable to conduct a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of such evidence. Examining the fairness of the proceedings as a whole, the Court concludes that there were no sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for the difficulties to the defence resulting from the admission of the investigating judge’s testimony.\n54: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n55: The applicant did not claim any award for pecuniary damage. He submitted that the objective of his application was to obtain a retrial before the domestic courts, should the Court hold that the admission of the investigating judge’s testimony in the trial before the  constituted a violation of the Convention. The Government did not comment on this issue.\n56: The Court accordingly does not make an award in respect of pecuniary damage. As to the specific measure requested by the applicant in compensation, the Court considers that where, as in the instant case, an individual has been the victim of proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, a retrial or the reopening of the case, if he or she so requests, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation (see Cudak v.  [GC], no. 15869/02, § 79, ECHR 2010 and Sejdovic v.  [GC], no. 56581/00, § 126, ECHR 2006II).\n57: The applicant claimed EUR 10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. The Government left the matter to the Court’s discretion.\n58: The Court accepts that being deprived of the guarantees provided by Article 6 of the Convention has caused the applicant non-pecuniary damage which is not remedied by the mere finding of a violation. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards him EUR 10,000 under that head.\n59: The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, claimed an estimated total of EUR 6,000 in costs and expenses for legal fees incurred in the proceedings before the Court. He further claimed an estimated total of EUR 15,000 for costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts. He claimed an additional amount in the range of EUR 30 to EUR 40 for copying costs and postal charges without specifying which part of this sum had been incurred before the domestic courts or the Court.\n60: The Government argued that any costs and expenses in relation to the proceedings before the  had not been incurred in order to prevent or redress a violation of the applicant’s Convention rights. Furthermore, the costs and expenses claimed by the applicant with respect to the proceedings before the domestic courts were based on an estimate and had not been substantiated by the applicant. As regards the lawyers’ fees claimed by the applicant for the proceedings before the Court, the Government left it to the Court’s discretion to decide on their reasonableness.\n61: According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 5,000 in respect of costs and expenses for the proceedings before the Court, less EUR 850 received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe, making a total of EUR 4,150, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant on that amount.\n62: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

                "CASE OF LUCÀ v. ITALY; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 33354/96) against the  lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Nicola Lucà (“the applicant”), on 17 January 1994.\n2: The applicant was represented by Mr F. Macrí, a lawyer practising in . The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, head of the Diplomatic Disputes Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assisted by Mr V. Esposito, co-Agent of the Government at the European Court of Human Rights.\n3: Relying on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, the applicant alleged that he had been convicted on the basis of statements made by a witness whom he had never been given an opportunity to examine or to have examined.\n4: The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n5: The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n6: By a decision of 9 March 1999, the Chamber declared the application admissible [Note by the Registry. The Court’s decision is obtainable from the Registry].\n7: The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n8: The applicant, who was born in 1955, is currently detained in Cosenza Prison.\n9: On 25 October 1992 N. and C. were arrested by carabinieri from Roccella Jonica () and found to be in possession of cocaine.\n10: On 25 and 26 October 1992 N. was questioned, initially by the carabinieri, and subsequently by the Locri public prosecutor (). He said that he had obtained part of the drugs from C. for his own use; the remainder belonged solely to C. He added that on the day of their arrest, C. had accompanied him to certain people’s homes to try to buy drugs. After the evening meal they had gone to the applicant’s home. The applicant had said that he was prepared to supply them with five hundred grams of cocaine to be delivered a few days later, as he was not willing to accept deferred payment and could not go out after 8 p.m. to get the drugs.\n11: N. was questioned by the carabinieri as someone who was helping them with their inquiries (“persona che puó riferire circostanze utili ai fini delle indagini”), not as an accused. For that reason, he was not assisted by a lawyer. However, the Locri public prosecutor subsequently decided that N. should be regarded as a “suspect” (“indagato”), and therefore questioned him in that capacity.\n12: By an order of 12 February 1993 the Locri investigating judge committed the applicant, C. and two other suspects, Mr A. and Mr T., for trial before Locri Criminal Court for drug trafficking. A. was also accused of unlawful possession of an offensive weapon. Separate proceedings were instituted against N. for possession of drugs.\n13: At the hearing on 17 July 1993, N. was called to give evidence as a person accused in connected proceedings (“imputato in procedimento connesso”). However, he chose to remain silent as he was entitled to do by virtue of Article 210 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereafter, “the CCP”).\n14: The lawyers acting for the accused argued that Article 513 of the CCP was unconstitutional since it was incompatible with Articles 3 and 24 of the Italian Constitution – which guaranteed the equality of citizens before the law\n15: On the same day the Criminal Court dismissed as manifestly unfounded the objection that the provision was unconstitutional and ordered that the record of the statements made by N. to the public prosecutor should be read out. It noted that the statutory right to remain silent was intended to protect an accused, who could not be required to make statements that could be used in evidence against him. Further, the rule that statements made during preliminary investigations could be read and used had been established by the  itself in its judgment no. 254 of 3 June 1992.\n16: In a judgment of 7 March 1994, which was lodged with the registry on 1 June 1994, Locri Criminal Court sentenced the applicant to eight years and four months’ imprisonment and a fine of 54,000,000 Italian lire (approximately 183,000 French francs). C., A. and T. were also given prison sentences ranging between six and nine years.\n17: The Criminal Court noted at the outset that the main evidence against the accused was the statements which N. had made to the public prosecutor, since the statements made to the carabinieri were inadmissible under Article 513 of the CCP. It also observed that having regard to N.’s personality and the spontaneity and precision with which his statements had been made, his depositions should be regarded as credible. The Criminal Court noted that N. had recognised a photograph of the applicant and had given an accurate description of his home and the route followed to get there. In addition, the applicant already had previous convictions under the drug-trafficking legislation and was under judicial supervision (sorveglianza speciale). He was prohibited from leaving his home after dusk, and that was a possible explanation for his unwillingness to go out after 8 p.m. Furthermore, the amount of cocaine found in C.’s possession showed that C. had contacts with drug dealers and meant that N’s account of his visit to the applicant’s home was probably true. It also confirmed that the negotiations that had started were genuine.\n18: On 13 July 1994 the applicant appealed to  Court of Appeal. He contested, inter alia, the reliability of N.’s statements and complained that they had been made in breach of the adversarial principle and in the absence of a judge or of the defendants’ lawyers.\n19: In a judgment of 7 November 1994,  Court of Appeal followed in substance the arguments set out in the order of 17 July 1993. It upheld the decision of the court below concerning the applicant, while reducing A.’s sentence.\n20: On 18 February 1995 the applicant and his co-accused appealed to the Court of Cassation. T. relied, inter alia, on Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention contending that N’s statements should have been declared inadmissible in evidence.\n21: In a judgment of 19 October 1995, which was lodged with the registry on 3 November 1995, the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeals of the applicant and his co-accused, holding that the grounds given by the Court of Appeal for its decision on all the disputed issues relating to the drug-trafficking count had been reasonable and correct. It overruled the impugned decision with regard to A.’s conviction for being unlawfully in possession of an offensive weapon and remitted the case to Catanzaro Court of Appeal.\n22: The Court of Cassation observed among other things that Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention concerned “ the examination of witnesses, who ... are required to tell the truth, not the examination of the accused, who are entitled to defend themselves by remaining silent or even by lying”. Further, since all States that were party to the Convention had an obligation by relevant domestic legislation to regulate the examination of witnesses, it was “obvious that ... when a witness refused to give evidence, statements made to the public prosecutor ... had to be produced for the court’s file”.\n23: The circumstances in which statements made by an accused or co-accused before trial may be admitted in evidence are set out in Article 513 of the CCP.\n24: As initially worded, the first paragraph Article 513 of the CCP provided that statements made by an accused before trial could by admitted in evidence by the trial court if the accused failed to appear or refused to repeat the statement.\n25: On the other hand, the second paragraph of Article 513 concerned statements made before trial by persons accused in connected proceedings. Unlike the position under the first paragraph, the second paragraph did not permit the trial court to admit such statements in evidence if the accused exercised his right to remain silent.\n26: In its judgment no. 254 of 1992, the Constitutional Court declared the second paragraph of Article 513 unconstitutional on the ground that, as the statements referred to therein could not be admitted in evidence at trial if the accused in connected proceedings remained silent, there was an unjustified difference in treatment between those statements and statements of the type referred to in the first paragraph. The  thereby enabled trial courts to admit statements made by a co-accused in connected proceedings, irrespective of whether the person against whom they were being used had been given the opportunity of examining the maker of the statement or of having him examined at any stage in the proceedings. Furthermore, the  made no reference to the procedural safeguards embodied in Article 6 of the Convention or to the criteria established by the Court’s case-law.\n27: By Law no. 267 of 7 August 1997 Parliament amended Article 513 with a view to making it consistent with the adversarial principle. In substance, statements made by a co-accused or by an accused in connected proceedings could no longer be used against another person without his consent if the maker of the statement exercised his right to remain silent.\n28: However, in its judgment no. 361 of 2 November 1998 the  again declared Article 513 unconstitutional, this time in its entirety. It held that precluding the trial court from admitting such statements in evidence if the maker remained silent entailed a risk that the court would be deprived of evidence that could assist it in reaching its decision, a risk that was dependent solely on the decision of the maker of the statements.\n29: Following that decision Parliament adopted the Constitutional Amendment Act no. 2 of 23 November 1999 whereby the principle of a fair trial was embodied in the Constitution itself. Article 111 of the Constitution, as now worded, reads:\n30: In Law no. 35 of 25 February 2000, the Italian parliament clarified how the amended Article 111 of the Constitution would apply to trials under way. In particular, the former rules continue to apply in certain circumstances.\n31: The applicant complained that the criminal proceedings against him had been unfair and alleged that he had been convicted on the basis of statements made to the public prosecutor, without being given an opportunity to examine the maker of the statements, N., or to have him examined. He relied on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n32: The Government submitted that, in principle, the Italian legal system afforded the accused the right to examine prosecution witnesses. However, in order to establish the facts of the case, the trial court was permitted in certain circumstances and subject to complying with the statutory conditions to rely in reaching its decision on evidence obtained during the preliminary investigation.\n33: In the instant case, under the relevant Italian legislation, N. was not a “witness” but a “person accused in connected proceedings”, and was entitled to remain silent. As the Court itself had recognised in Saunders (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2064, § 68), “although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6”. Accordingly, the domestic authorities had had no alternative but to accept N.’s decision not to give evidence, since requiring him to repeat his statements at the trial would have entailed a violation of his fundamental rights.\n34: The Government emphasised that three interests had been at stake: the right of the co-accused to remain silent, the right of the accused to examine a co-accused witness and the right of the judicial authority not to be deprived of evidence obtained during the investigation. The issue was so complex that the provisions governing the admissibility of the statements of a prosecution witness who was also a co-accused had been examined on several occasions by the  and been the subject of amendments. In particular, the  had restated in its case-law the principle that a court should not be deprived of evidence obtained during the investigation (“non dispersione”).\n35: The Government observed lastly that on 10 September 1997, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe had adopted Recommendation No. R (97) 13, concerning intimidation of witnesses and the rights of the defence, in which it was suggested that States should use “pre-trial statements given before a judicial authority as evidence in court when it is not possible for witnesses to appear before the court or when appearing in court might result in great and actual danger to the life and security of witnesses, their relatives or other persons close to them”.\n36: The applicant disagreed with the Government’s arguments. He said that his contention was not that the domestic courts had failed to apply the provisions in force at the material time, but that those provisions were incompatible with the principles set out in the Convention. Furthermore, the fact that the Italian parliament had decided on 7 August 1997 to amend Article 513 of the CCP only confirmed the view that the provision in question infringed every accused person’s “right to put the prosecution to proof”. He stressed, lastly, that N.’s statements had been the only evidence against him.\n37: As the requirements of Article 6 § 3 are to be seen as particular aspects of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 § 1, the Court will examine the complaints under those two provisions taken together (see, among many other authorities, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, p. 711, § 49).\n38: The Court reiterates that the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court’s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among other authorities, Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports 1996-II, p. 470, § 67, and Van Mechelen and Others, cited above, p. 711, § 50).\n39: The evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument. There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence. As a general rule, paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6 require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statement or at a later stage (see Lüdi v. Switzerland, judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 21, § 49, and Van Mechelen and Others, cited above, p. 711, § 51).\n40: As the Court has stated on a number of occasions (see, among other authorities, Isgrò v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no. 194-A, p. 12, § 34, and Lüdi, cited above, p. 21, § 47), it may prove necessary in certain circumstances to refer to depositions made during the investigative stage (in particular, where a witness refuses to repeat his deposition in public owing to fears for his safety, a not infrequent occurrence in trials concerning Mafia-type organisations). If the defendant has been given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the depositions, either when made or at a later stage, their admission in evidence will not in itself contravene Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see Unterpertinger v. Austria, judgment of 24 November 1986, Series A no. 110, pp. 14-15, §§ 31-33; Saïdi v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, pp. 56-57, §§ 43-44; and Van Mechelen and Others, cited above, p. 712, § 55; see also Dorigo v. Italy, application no. 33286/96, Commission’s report of 9 September 1998, § 43, unpublished, and, on the same case, Committee of Ministers Resolution DH (99) 258 of 15 April 1999).\n41: In that regard, the fact that the depositions were, as here, made by a co-accused rather than by a witness is of no relevance. In that connection, the Court reiterates that the term “witness” has an “autonomous” meaning in the Convention system (see Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32-33, § 33). Thus, where a deposition may serve to a material degree as the basis for a conviction, then, irrespective of whether it was made by a witness in the strict sense or by a co-accused, it constitutes evidence for the prosecution to which the guarantees provided by Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention apply (see, mutatis mutandis, Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy, judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 950-51, §§ 51-52).\n42: In the light of the foregoing, the reasons given by the Court of Cassation in its judgment of 19 October 1995 for dismissing the appeal brought under Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention – reasons on which the Government also relied in part – do not appear pertinent. In particular, the fact that under the domestic law in force at the material time (see paragraph 26 above) the court could rule statements made before the trial admissible if a co-accused refused to give evidence could not deprive the accused of the right which Article 6 § 3 (d) afforded him to examine or have examined in adversarial proceedings any material evidence against him.\n43: In the instant case, the Court notes that the domestic courts convicted the applicant solely on the basis of statements made by N. before the trial and that neither the applicant nor his lawyer was given an opportunity at any stage of the proceedings to question him.\n44: In those circumstances, the Court is not satisfied that the applicant was given an adequate and proper opportunity to contest the statements on which his conviction was based.\n45: The applicant was, therefore, denied a fair trial. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d).\n46: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n47: The applicant said that his conviction and imprisonment had been unjust. He had thereby been prevented from working and his private and family life had suffered. He alleged that as a result of the violation of the Convention he had sustained substantial pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, which he put at 500,000,000 Italian lire (ITL).\n48: The Court finds no causal link between the violation of Article 6 of the Convention and the pecuniary damage alleged by the applicant. The Court cannot speculate on what the outcome of the proceedings would have been if they had complied with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). Consequently, it dismisses the applicant’s claims under this head (see Cöeme and Others v. Belgium [GC], nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 155, ECHR 2000-VII).\n49: The applicant also sought the reimbursement of various costs that he had incurred before the domestic courts and the Convention institutions.\n50: Under its settled case-law, the Court can only make an award in respect of costs and expenses incurred by the applicant if it is established that such costs and expenses were actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum (see, among other authorities, Zimmermann and Steiner v. Switzerland, judgment of 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66, p. 14, § 36). The Court notes, however, that the applicant has not provided any details of the costs of which he seeks reimbursement. It accordingly dismisses his claim for reimbursement of the costs incurred before the domestic courts.\n51: As regards the costs incurred before the Convention institutions, the Court considers that aspects of the case were complex. However, the applicant has not produced any evidence in support of his claim for costs. Nevertheless, in the light of the written work which his lawyer has incontestably performed, the Court considers it appropriate to award the applicant a lump sum of ITL 3,000,000, to cover his costs.\n52: According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in  at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 3.5% per annum."

                "CASE OF SOLAKOV v. \"THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA\"; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 47023/99) against the  lodged on 3 December 1998 with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Blagoj Solakov (“the applicant”) who is national of the .\n2: The applicant was represented before the Court by his counsel. The Government of the  (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Cvetkovski, and Co-Agent, Ms R. Lazarevska-Gerovska, advisers at the Ministry of Justice.\n3: The applicant alleged under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention that his trial was unfair in that he had been unable to cross-examine the witnesses whose statements served as the only basis for his conviction and to obtain the attendance and examination of two witnesses for the defence.\n4: The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n5: By a decision of 25 January 2001 the Chamber declared the application admissible [Note by the Registry. The Court’s decision is obtainable from the Registry].\n6: The Government, but not the applicant, filed additional observations on the merits and produced additional documents (Rule 59 § 1).\n7: A hearing took place in public in the , , on 31 May 2001 (Rule 59 § 2).\n8: The applicant, who had lived for a while in the , was suspected of drug trafficking and a warrant for his arrest was issued by the  police in January 1996.\n9: Following the request of the United States authorities, on 15 August 1997 the public prosecutor asked the Skopje Municipal Court to institute a preliminary investigation against the applicant on charges that between January 1992 and May 1995 he had smuggled around 10.5 kg of drugs from Bulgaria and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the United States and that for that purpose had set up a drug-trafficking network involving also his son, who lives in the United States. The prosecution’s request set out the names of the persons involved and against whom criminal proceedings were pending or completed in the  and asked for their questioning.\n10: On 30 September 1997 the investigating judge opened a criminal investigation against the applicant, decided to hear the witnesses proposed by the prosecution and detained the applicant on remand.\n11: On 1 October 1997 the investigating judge asked the Ministry of Justice to contact the  government and to request their assistance in the hearing of some witnesses in their country. On 10 October 1997 the Ministry of Justice addressed the request to the  embassy.\n12: On 7 November 1997 the  embassy was informed by the investigating judge of the investigation pending against the applicant. The notice contained the names of the witnesses to be examined in the  and a list of fifteen questions to be put to them.\n13: On 28 November 1997 the applicant’s lawyer was informed that the investigating judge would go to the  one week later and was summoned to the hearing.\n14: On 1 December 1997 the lawyer was denied a visa for the  on the ground that he had not produced all the relevant documents required. The  embassy informed him that it would review his application for a visa provided that he submitted a certificate of his working position, income, and seniority and evidence that he owned real estate and had family ties in the . The lawyer never reapplied for a visa. On 2 December 1997 the applicant withdrew his power of attorney.\n15: On 3 December 1997 the applicant appointed another lawyer, who, on the same day, was summoned to attend the hearing of witnesses in the , scheduled for 8 December 1997. On the summons, the lawyer placed his signature in the space provided for the bailiff’s signature and the bailiff placed his signature in the space provided for the lawyer’s signature.\n16: On 4 December 1997 the applicant was questioned. He stated that he had been informed by the investigating judge that witnesses would be heard in the . He had contacted his second lawyer and left to him the decision whether or not to attend the hearing. He further stated that the expenses for the trip would not be a problem as he had sufficient funds to cover them.\n17: On the same day the investigating judge informed the United States embassy in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia that on 28 November 1997 the applicant’s first lawyer had been summoned to attend the questioning of the witnesses in the United States and that the applicant’s second lawyer had declared that there was no need to attend the questioning and that he had insufficient funds to meet the travel expenses.\n18: On 8 and 9 December 1997, five witnesses were heard by the investigating judge in the presence of the public prosecutor and the court interpreter. Their testimonies were recorded. The witnesses were involved in the drug-trafficking network organised by the applicant, and they were all serving prison sentences in the  for drug trafficking.\n19: According to the witnesses, who were under oath and were heard separately, it was the applicant who had set up the entire network and who had organised the smuggling into the  and the re-sale there of approximately 10.5 kg of drugs. The applicant had contacts in , from where he would smuggle the drugs into the . He would then arrange for them to be smuggled into the . Some of the witnesses stated that they had smuggled the drugs in a plaster-cast which the applicant would wrap around one of their legs, as though it were broken. On their arrival in the  they would hand over the drugs to the applicant’s son in return for payment. Some of the witnesses stated that they had had an agreement with the applicant and his son for drug dealing and had been supplied with the drugs in the applicant’s and his son’s house.\n20: Two of the witnesses who had travelled to  on separate occasions gave evidence that they had been taken into Mr Robert M.’s flat in , where Mr Robert M. and the applicant had wrapped plasters with drugs around one of the witnesses’ legs. None of the witnesses made any statement regarding Mr Angel B.\n21: On 22 December 1997 the public prosecutor indicted the applicant with drug trafficking from  and the  to the  and with setting up an international network for that purpose. The witnesses’ statements were included in the indictment.\n22: On 1 January 1998 the applicant made a submission to the Municipal Court that there was no case to answer as there was no convincing evidence against him. In particular, the indictment was predominantly based on the testimonies of the witnesses who were serving prison sentences in the  and who had not been cross-examined by the defence. The applicant argued that the witnesses had a deal with the  authorities to have their sentences reduced in exchange for their cooperation. On the one hand, since they had already been convicted in the , the witnesses were aware that they would not risk anything if they gave false evidence, as they could not be prosecuted for drug trafficking under the law of the . On the other hand, if they modified their testimonies, they ran the risk of losing all the benefits which had been agreed upon by the authorities.\n23: On 12 January 1998 the court held that on the basis of all the evidence in the case there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant might have committed the offence with which he had been charged and refused to terminate the criminal proceedings against him.\n24: On 13 January 1998 a hearing was held before the Skopje Municipal Court. On 22 January 1998 a second hearing was held. The applicant claimed to be innocent and stated that he had not travelled to the  because he knew that it might be dangerous for him.\n25: The applicant complained that he had been unable to cross-examine the witnesses. He also objected to their statements being read out in open court.\n26: At the hearing of 22 January 1998 the applicant requested that two additional witnesses for the defence be examined. The record of the hearing states as follows:\n27: On 26 January 1998 the municipal court found the applicant guilty of drug trafficking within the meaning of Article 255 § 2 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. The court dismissed the applicant’s objection that there had been a breach of his right of defence in that he had been unable to cross-examine the witnesses, on the ground that it had been impossible to summon them. It considered the witnesses’ statements reliable, since they had had no opportunity to make a deal with the public prosecutor of the  to have their sentences in the  reduced in exchange for giving evidence against the applicant. The court further observed that all the witnesses had recognised the applicant on a photo and that, although each of them had been heard separately by the investigating judge in the presence of the public prosecutor, their statements were consistent and precise. The court also had regard to the applicant’s testimony.\n28: On 26 February 1998 the public prosecutor submitted an appeal to the Skopje Court of Appeal (Апелационен суд) requesting an increase of the sentence in view of the nature of the offence committed, the degree of danger to the public, the fact that it concerned organised crime at international level and the fact that the applicant was a habitual offender.\n29: On 6 March 1998 the applicant also filed an appeal with the Skopje Court of Appeal, complaining, inter alia, that the lower court had infringed the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 6 of the Convention, as it had reached its verdict only on the basis of the statements of witnesses whom he had not cross-examined. The applicant further complained about the court’s refusal to hear two additional witnesses on his behalf.\n30: On 20 May 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal on the ground that the Municipal Court had acted in accordance with Article 325 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which stated that witnesses might be heard in the absence of the accused or his lawyer if there was a valid reason making it impossible or extremely difficult to do otherwise (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below).\n31: On 11 June 1998 the applicant filed an appeal on points of law (Барање за вонредно преиспитување на правосилна одлука) with the Supreme Court (Врховен суд).\n32: On 2 July 1998 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on points of law on the grounds that the investigating judge had acted within his competence when he decided to interrogate the witnesses in the United States and that the applicant and his lawyers had been given an opportunity to attend the hearing. Furthermore, the Supreme Court held that it would have been impossible to have the witnesses heard at the public hearing, as they were serving a prison sentence abroad. Consequently, in accordance with the rules of the Code of Criminal Procedure there were sufficient reasons to justify the statements being read out at the public hearing.\n33: On 6 September 1999 the applicant’s son declared before a notary that his father had had nothing to do with drug trafficking. Another person also declared before a public notary that the applicant had been engaged in trade with spare parts for motor vehicles.\n34: Article 22 § 6, inter alia, provides that a bench of three judges of the first-instance court shall decide on appeals lodged against the decisions of the investigating judge.\n35: Article 66 §§ 2 and 5 provides that the president of the court may officially appoint a lawyer for a person who is detained pending trial.\n36: Under Articles 69 and 124 a lawyer has the right to consult all the documents in the case file from the day the prosecution authorities request the investigating judge to open a preliminary investigation. A defendant enjoys that right from the day he has been questioned by the investigating judge.\n37: Article 160 provides that the parties may ask the investigating judge to undertake different actions in the course of the investigation.\n38: Article 274 §§ 1 and 2 reads as follows:\n39: Article 392 provides that criminal proceedings may be reopened if, inter alia, a new fact or new evidence is adduced or called before the court, which may prove the convicted person’s innocence or militate for the reduction of his sentence.\n40: The applicant complained under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention that his trial was unfair in that he had been unable to cross-examine the witnesses whose statements served as the only basis for his conviction and that he had been unable to obtain the attendance and examination of two witnesses for the defence.\n41: The applicant stated that he had not been provided with sufficient time and information to organise the trip to the  and prepare for cross-examination of the witnesses. In particular, although the investigating judge had planned his trip to the  as early as November 1997, he had summoned the applicant’s lawyers only one week before the trip was to take place. The summons had contained no detailed information about the venue or exact date of the questioning, the number and names of the witnesses to be heard, or the questions that the investigating judge wished to put to them.\n42: The applicant contended that the notice of the investigating judge to the  embassy of 4 December 1997 had prevented the lawyers from obtaining a visa. In particular, by the time this notice had been served, the first lawyer had already been denied a visa.\n43: The applicant had not had sufficient time to react and request that the trip be postponed as he had not been aware of the exact date of the hearing, nor had he had sufficient time to challenge the veracity of the statements or complain about the procedural flows during the preliminary investigation.\n44: The applicant had never been allowed to hear the recording of the statements on tape and, despite his requests, he was given no possibility to verify the accuracy of the transcripts with the tape recording. Moreover, the statements, which were taken in English, had never been translated by a certified translator or signed by the witnesses.\n45: The applicant stated that it had been clear from the Municipal Court’s and the Court of Appeal’s judgments that the courts had relied mainly, if not solely, on the statements of the witnesses taken in the , whom he had been unable to cross-examine. In addition, the statements had not been reliable as some of the witnesses made comments relating to the possibility of their being charged or exposed to some sort of risk in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which indicated that they may have been promised some kind of a deal by the investigating judge or the prosecution authorities.\n46: The applicant contended that the Municipal Court refused to hear the two additional witnesses for the defence on the sole ground that sufficient evidence had been adduced at the main trial so that no further testimony was necessary. They had been important witnesses for the defence and their names had been mentioned in some of the witnesses’ statements. The authorities had not attempted to find their addresses in  or the  and to summon them.\n47: In sum, the defence had been denied adequate and proper opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses whose statements served as the basis for the applicant’s conviction, and had been refused leave to call two witnesses on the applicant’s behalf.\n48: The Government reaffirmed that under the domestic legal system all evidence should in principle be given at an adversarial hearing before the court having jurisdiction. However, it was possible in some circumstances provided by law not to hear the witnesses at a public hearing, but only to read out their statements. According to court practice, the fact that the witnesses concerned had been convicted and were serving prison sentences abroad constituted an important ground for taking only their sworn statements and not hearing them in person at the public hearing.\n49: They maintained that the fact that the statements had been taken by the investigating judge, who was impartial and whose function was to collect evidence not only against but also in favour of the applicant, offered a sufficient safeguard for the applicant’s right to a fair trial.\n50: A letter was addressed to the  embassy urging it to issue the necessary visas for the applicant’s lawyers. The investigating judge proceeded with the hearing only when it was clear that the defence had been unable to attend for reasons beyond the court’s control. In particular, the applicant’s first lawyer had not submitted additional documents requested by the embassy and the applicant’s second lawyer had declared before the investigating judge, perhaps for tactical reasons, that there was no need for him to attend the hearing. In addition, the applicant had declared before the investigating judge that he had left the decision whether or not to attend the hearing to his second lawyer and that he had sufficient means to cover the expenses for the trip.\n51: The dates for the hearing of the witnesses in question were proposed by the  authorities who provided assistance. Neither the applicant nor his lawyers requested that the trip be postponed or complained afterwards that they had not had sufficient time to organise the trip. The Government considered that the dates chosen for the trip had represented the right balance between the right of the accused to trial within a reasonable period of time and the right to adequate time and facilities to prepare for his defence.\n52: The Government stated that the applicant had never challenged the way the witnesses’ statements were translated or their authenticity or veracity. Moreover, the applicant had never asked to hear the tape-recording of the witnesses’ statements at any stage of the proceedings.\n53: They further submitted that the courts had taken into consideration all the circumstances relating to the taking of evidence from the witnesses in question, and had paid special attention to giving their statements the weight that was proper in view of the fact that the applicant had not cross-examined them. The witnesses had been warned that giving false statements was a crime. No valid reasons were found by the courts that might cast doubt on the credibility of their statements. They were corroborated by each other and by other evidence examined by the courts, in particular by the report on the search of the flat of the applicant’s son, where the applicant used to live and the reports on seizure of the narcotics.\n54: The defence had been given an adequate and proper opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses in question and the Government should not be held responsible for the fact that the defence did not avail itself of this opportunity.\n55: The Government contended that the domestic courts enjoyed full discretion in deciding which witnesses to call. In the present case, the domestic court had considered that there was no need to call the two witnesses, as their testimonies were immaterial for the establishment of the facts of the case and sufficient evidence had already been adduced before the court. The applicant’s request was submitted as late as 22 January 1998 and the applicant had given no reasons as to why the examination of those witnesses was important for his defence.\n56: As the requirements of Article 6 § 3 are to be seen as particular aspects of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 § 1, the Court will examine the complaints under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) taken together (see, among many other authorities, A.M. v. Italy, no. 37019/97, § 23, ECHR 1999-IX, and Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, p. 711, § 49).\n57: The Court recalls that, as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce. More specifically, Article 6 § 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses, in the “autonomous” sense given to that word in the Convention system; it “does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused’s behalf: its essential aim, as is indicated by the words ‘under the same conditions’, is a full ‘equality of arms’ in the matter”. The concept of “equality of arms” does not, however, exhaust the content of paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6, nor that of paragraph 1 of which this phrase represents one application among many others (see, among other authorities, Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, p. 32, § 33, and Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, § 89).\n58: The Court recalls that the applicant alleges a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention on essentially two grounds: that his trial was unfair in that he had been unable to cross-examine the witnesses whose statements served as the only basis for his conviction and that he had been unable to obtain the attendance and examination of two witnesses for the defence.\n59: It is clear that both lawyers of the applicant were summoned to the hearing of the witnesses. The applicant’s argument that his second lawyer was not duly summoned (see paragraph 41 above) is not supported by the documents since it appears from the summons (see paragraph 15 above) that the lawyer had signed it, albeit in the wrong place.\n60: The Court observes that there is no indication that the applicant or his second lawyer expressed any intention to attend the cross-examination of the witnesses in the . In particular, on 4 December 1997 the applicant declared before the investigating judge that he had left the decision whether or not to go to the  to his second lawyer and that he had sufficient means to cover the travel expenses. The applicant’s second lawyer never filed an application for a visa with the  embassy and never requested the postponement of the hearing of the witnesses in case he thought he did not have sufficient time to obtain it. Moreover, the applicant’s first lawyer never renewed his application for a visa and on 2 December 1997 the applicant withdrew his power of attorney.\n61: Turning to the trial and the appellate stage of the proceedings the Court observes that the applicant never complained that he had been unable to cross-examine the witnesses in question due to lack of time or information, nor did he expressly ask for the witnesses to be summoned.\n62: It is true that the witnesses’ statements played an important role in the applicant’s conviction. However, it does not appear that the applicant contested their content as such (see paragraphs 22 and 25 above). He had not expressly given any questions that he would have liked to be put to the witnesses. Furthermore, it was only at the second hearing that the applicant submitted that he had been unable to cross-examine the witnesses (see paragraph 25 above).\n63: The Court finds that the present case can be distinguished from A.M. v.  (cited above) where the witnesses were questioned by a police officer before trial and the applicant’s lawyer was not allowed to attend their examination.\n64: The Court finds no evidence to support the applicant’s allegations that he had expressed the desire to verify the accuracy of the transcripts but had been denied that right as the prosecutor’s office claimed that the tape recording had been needed for translation.\n65: As regards the applicant’s complaint that he had been unable to obtain the attendance and the examination of two additional witnesses, the Court observes that he had the opportunity to request the summoning of the witnesses during the preliminary investigation, in his submissions that there had been no case to answer, or at the hearings of 12 and 13 January 1998. However, he filed such a request only at the hearing held on 22 January 1998.\n66: The Court notes that the addresses of the two witnesses, who lived either in  or the , were unknown. Accordingly, it would have been difficult to summon them. Having regard to the reasons invoked by the applicant for hearing these witnesses (see paragraph 26 above), the Court finds that the refusal to hear them in the prevailing circumstances was not as such contrary to Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.\n67: In conclusion, the Court is satisfied that the applicant was given an adequate and proper opportunity to present his defence. The court’s refusal to summon the two additional witnesses did not restrict his defence rights to such an extent that he was not afforded a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention."

                "CASE OF SCHATSCHASCHWILI v. GERMANY; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 9154/10) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Georgian national, Mr Swiadi Schatschaschwili (“the applicant”), on 12 February 2010.\n2: By a letter dated 29 December 2013, the applicant’s lawyer notified the Court that the applicant had informed him that his real name was Avtandil Sisvadze. The Court advised the parties on 14 January 2014 that it would continue processing the application under the case name of Schatschaschwili v. Germany. This corresponded to the applicant’s name as referred to in the domestic court proceedings in issue as well as in his application lodged with the Court.\n3: The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr H. Meyer-Mews, a lawyer practising in Bremen. The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms A. Wittling-Vogel, Mr H.-J. Behrens and Ms K. Behr, of the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection.\n4: The applicant alleged in particular, relying on Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention, that his trial had been unfair as neither he nor his lawyer had been granted an opportunity at any stage of the criminal proceedings against him to examine the victims, who were the only direct witnesses of the offence allegedly committed by him in Göttingen in February 2007 and on whose statements the Göttingen Regional Court had relied in convicting him.\n5: The application was allocated to the Fifth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). The Government were given notice of the application on 15 January 2013. On 17 April 2014 a Chamber of the Fifth Section composed of Mark Villiger, President, Angelika Nußberger, Boštjan M. Zupančič, Ann Power-Forde, Ganna Yudkivska, Helena Jäderblom and Aleš Pejchal, judges, and Claudia Westerdiek, Section Registrar, unanimously declared the application partly admissible and held, by five votes to two, that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.\n6: On 15 July 2014 the applicant requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 73. On 8 September 2014 a panel of the Grand Chamber accepted that request.\n7: The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 26 §§ 4 and 5 of the Convention and Rule 24. At the final deliberations, Jon Fridrik Kjølbro and András Sajó, substitute judges, replaced Josep Casadevall and Isabelle Berro, who were unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 24 § 3).\n8: The applicant and the Government each filed a memorial on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Czech Government, which had been given leave by the President on 3 November 2014 to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 3).\n9: The Georgian Government, having been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 §§ 1 and 4), did not indicate that they wished to exercise that right.\n10: A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 4 March 2015 (Rule 59 § 3).\n11: The applicant was born in 1978. When he lodged his application he was being detained in Rosdorf Prison, Germany. He now lives in Khashuri/Surami, Georgia.\n12: On the evening of 14 October 2006, the applicant and an unidentified accomplice robbed L. and I., two Lithuanian nationals, in the women’s flat in Kassel.\n13: The perpetrators were aware that the flat was used for prostitution and expected its two female occupants to keep valuables and cash there. They had passed by in the early evening in order to make sure that no clients or a procurer were present. Shortly afterwards they returned and overpowered L., who had answered the doorbell. The applicant pointed a gas pistol which resembled a real gun at both women and threatened to shoot them if they did not disclose where their money was kept. While his accomplice watched over the women, the applicant found or forced the women to hand over to him approximately 1,100 euros (EUR) and six mobile phones.\n14: On 3 February 2007 the applicant, acting jointly with several accomplices, robbed O. and P., two female Latvian nationals who were temporarily resident in Germany and working as prostitutes, in their flat in Göttingen.\n15: On the evening of 2 February 2007, the day before the offence, one of the applicant’s co-accused had passed by O.’s and P.’s flat in Göttingen together with an accomplice, R., an acquaintance of O. and P. They intended to verify whether the two women were the flat’s only occupants and whether they kept any valuables there, and discovered a safe in the kitchen.\n16: On 3 February 2007 at around 8 p.m., the applicant and a further accomplice, B., gained access to O.’s and P.’s flat by pretending to be potential clients, while one of their co-accused waited in a car parked close to the building and another waited in front of it. Once inside the flat, B. produced a knife that he had been carrying in his jacket. P., in order to escape from the perpetrators, jumped from the balcony located approximately two metres off the ground and ran away. The applicant jumped down after her but abandoned the chase after some minutes when some passers-by appeared nearby on the street. He then called the co-accused who had been waiting in front of the women’s flat building on his mobile phone and told him that one of the women had jumped from the balcony and that he had unsuccessfully chased her. The applicant agreed on a meeting point with his co-accused where they would pick him up by car once B. had left the crime scene and joined them.\n17: In the meantime, inside the flat, B., having overpowered O., threatened to kill her with his knife if she did not disclose where the women kept their money or if she refused to open the safe for him. Fearing for her life, O. opened the safe, from which B. removed EUR 300, and also handed over the contents of her wallet (EUR 250). B. left the flat at around 8.30 p.m., taking the money and P.’s mobile telephone, as well as the flat’s landline telephone, with him and joined the coaccused. The coaccused and B. then picked up the applicant at the agreed meeting point in their car. At approximately 9.30 p.m. P. rejoined O. in their flat.\n18: O. and P. gave an account of the events to their neighbour E. the morning after the offence. They then left their Göttingen flat out of fear and stayed for several days with their friend L., one of the victims of the offence committed in Kassel, to whom they had also described the offence in detail the day after it occurred.\n19: On 12 February 2007 L. informed the police of the offence committed against O. and P. in Göttingen. Between 15 and 18 February 2007 O. and P. were repeatedly questioned by the police as to the events of 2 and 3 February 2007. In those interviews they described the course of events as set out above. The police, having checked O.’s and P.’s papers, found their residence and occupation in Germany to be in compliance with German immigration and trade law.\n20: As the witnesses had explained during their police interviews that they intended to return to Latvia in the days to come, on 19 February 2007 the prosecution asked the investigating judge to question the witnesses in order to obtain a true statement which could be used at the subsequent trial (eine im späteren Hauptverfahren verwertbare wahrheitsgemäße Aussage).\n21: As a result, on 19 February 2007, O. and P. were questioned by an investigating judge and again described the course of events as set out above. At that time, the applicant had not yet been informed of the investigation proceedings initiated against him, so as not to put the investigation at risk. No warrant for his arrest had yet been issued and he was not yet represented by counsel. The investigating judge excluded the applicant from the witness hearing before him in accordance with Article 168c of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 56 below) since he was concerned that the witnesses, whom he had found to be considerably shocked and distressed by the offence, would be afraid of telling the truth in the applicant’s presence. The witnesses confirmed at that hearing that they intended to return to Latvia as soon as possible.\n22: O. and P. returned to Latvia shortly after that hearing. The applicant was subsequently arrested on 6 March 2007.\n23: The Göttingen Regional Court summoned O. and P. by registered post to appear at the trial on 24 August 2007. However, both witnesses refused to attend the hearing before the Regional Court, relying on medical certificates dated 9 August 2007 which indicated that they were in an unstable, post-traumatic emotional and psychological state.\n24: Consequently, on 29 August 2007, the Regional Court sent letters by registered post to both witnesses informing them that the court, while not being in a position to compel them to appear at a court hearing in Germany, nonetheless wished to hear them as witnesses at the trial. The court stressed that they would receive protection in Germany and that all costs incurred attending the hearing would be reimbursed and, proposing several options, asked in what circumstances they would be willing to testify at the trial. While an acknowledgement of receipt was returned for both letters, P. did not respond. O., for her part, informed the Regional Court in writing that she was still traumatised by the offence and would therefore neither agree to appear at the trial in person nor to testify by means of an audio-visual link. O. further stated that she had nothing to add to the statements she had made in the course of the interviews carried out by the police and the investigating judge in February 2007.\n25: The Regional Court nevertheless decided to request legal assistance from the Latvian authorities under the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 20 April 1959, as supplemented by the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union of 29 May 2000 (see paragraphs 64-66 below), taking the view that O. and P. were obliged under Latvian law to appear before a court in Latvia following a request for legal assistance. It asked for the witnesses to be summoned before a court in Latvia and for an audio-visual link to be set up in order for the hearing to be conducted by the presiding judge of the Regional Court (audiovisuelle Vernehmung). It considered, referring to Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention, that defence counsel and the accused, just like the judges and the prosecution, should have the right to put questions to the witnesses for the first time.\n26: However, the witness hearing of O. and P. scheduled by the competent Latvian court for 13 February 2008 was cancelled shortly before that date by the presiding Latvian judge. The latter found that the witnesses, again relying on medical certificates, had demonstrated that they were still suffering from post-traumatic disorder as a consequence of the offence and that further confrontation with the events in Göttingen would risk aggravating their condition. O. had further claimed that, following threats by the accused, she feared possible acts of revenge.\n27: By a letter dated 21 February 2008, the Regional Court, which had requested and obtained copies of the medical certificates the witnesses had submitted to the Latvian court, informed its Latvian counterpart that, according to the standards of German criminal procedure law, the witnesses had not sufficiently substantiated their refusal to testify. The court suggested to the competent Latvian judge that the witnesses be examined by a public medical officer (Amtsarzt) or, alternatively, that they be compelled to attend the hearing. The letter went unanswered.\n28: By a decision of 21 February 2008, the Regional Court, dismissing an objection to the admission of the witnesses’ pre-trial statements raised by counsel for one of the co-accused, ordered that the records of O.’s and P.’s interviews by the police and the investigating judge be read out at the trial in accordance with Article 251 §§ 1 (2) and 2 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 61 below). It considered that, as required by said provisions, there were insurmountable obstacles which made it impossible to hear the witnesses in the foreseeable future as they were unreachable. It had not been possible to hear O. and P. in the course of the trial since they had returned to their home country, Latvia, shortly after their interviews at the investigation stage, and all attempts to hear their evidence at the main hearing, which the court had no means of enforcing, had been to no avail. Pointing out that the courts were under an obligation to conduct proceedings involving deprivation of liberty expeditiously, and in view of the fact that the accused had already been in custody for a considerable period of time, the court was of the opinion that it was not justified to delay further the proceedings.\n29: The Regional Court emphasised that at the investigation stage there had been no indication that O. and P., who had testified on several occasions before the police and then before the investigating judge, would refuse to repeat their statements at a subsequent trial. It considered that, notwithstanding the resulting restrictions for the defence on account of the admission of O.’s and P.’s pre-trial statements as evidence in the proceedings, the trial as a whole could be conducted fairly and in compliance with the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.\n30: By a judgment of 25 April 2008, the Regional Court, considering the facts established as described above, convicted the applicant of two counts of aggravated robbery combined with aggravated extortion involving coercion, committed jointly with other perpetrators in Kassel on 14 October 2006 and in Göttingen on 3 February 2007. It sentenced the applicant, who had been represented by counsel at the trial, to nine years and six months’ imprisonment.\n31: The Regional Court based its findings of fact concerning the offence committed by the applicant in Kassel on the statements made at the trial by the victims L. and I., who had identified the applicant without any hesitation. It further noted that their statements were supported by the statements made at the trial by the police officers who had attended the crime scene and had interviewed L. and I. in the course of the preliminary investigation. In view of these elements, the Regional Court considered that the submissions made by the applicant, who had initially claimed his innocence and had then admitted that he had been in L.’s and I.’s flat but had only secretly stolen EUR 750, alone, after a quarrel with the women, had been refuted.\n32: In the establishment of the facts concerning the offence in Göttingen, the Regional Court relied in particular on the pre-trial statements made by the victims O. and P., whom it considered to be key witnesses for the prosecution (maßgebliche Belastungszeuginnen), in the course of their police interviews and before the investigating judge.\n33: In its judgment, which ran to some 152 pages, the Regional Court pointed out that it was aware of the reduced evidentiary value of the records of O.’s and P.’s pre-trial testimonies. It further took into account the fact that neither the applicant nor counsel for the defence had been provided with an opportunity to examine the only direct witnesses to the offence in Göttingen at any stage of the proceedings.\n34: The Regional Court noted that the records of O.’s and P.’s interviews at the investigation stage showed that they had given detailed and coherent descriptions of the circumstances of the offence. Minor contradictions in their statements could be explained by their concern not to disclose their residence and activities to the authorities and by the psychological strain to which they had been subjected during and following the incident. The witnesses had feared problems with the police and acts of revenge by the perpetrators. This explained why they had not reported the offence immediately after the events and why the police had only been informed on 12 February 2007 by their friend L.\n35: The Regional Court further took note of the fact that O. and P. had failed to identify the applicant when shown several photos of potential suspects during the police interviews. It observed that the witnesses’ attention during the incident had been focused on the other perpetrator carrying the knife and that the applicant himself had only stayed in the flat for a short period of time. Their inability to identify the applicant also showed that, contrary to the defence’s allegation, the witnesses had not testified with a view to incriminating him. The court further considered that the fact that the witnesses had failed to attend the trial could be explained by their unease at having to recall, and being questioned about, the offence and therefore did not as such affect their credibility.\n36: In its establishment of the facts, the Regional Court further had regard to the following additional evidence: the statements made at the trial by several witnesses to whom O. and P. had reported the offence shortly after it happened, namely the victims’ neighbour E. and their friend L., as well as the police officers and the investigating judge who had examined O. and P. at the pre-trial stage; geographical data and information obtained by tapping the applicant’s and his co-accused’s mobile telephones and by means of a satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) receiver in the car of one of the co-accused; the applicant’s admission in the course of the trial that he had been in the victims’ flat at the relevant time; and the similarity in the way in which the offences in Kassel and Göttingen had been committed.\n37: The Regional Court stressed that, once O. and P. had proved to be unavailable, it had ensured that as many as possible of the witnesses who had been in contact with O. and P. in relation to the events in issue were heard at the trial, in order to verify the victims’ credibility.\n38: In the Regional Court’s opinion the fact that the detailed description of the events given in O.’s and P.’s pre-trial statements was consistent with the account they had given the morning after the offence to their neighbour was a strong indication of their credibility and the veracity of their statements. E. had further testified that, on the evening of 3 February 2007 at around 9.30 p.m., another neighbour, an elderly woman who became scared and angry when she saw P. running around in front of her window, had called on her and asked her to accompany her to the women’s flat to investigate what had happened. O. and P. had, however, not answered the door when the neighbours rang the doorbell.\n39: The Regional Court further observed that O.’s and P.’s description of the events was also consistent with their friend L.’s recollection of her conversations with O. and P. after the offence.\n40: In addition, the Regional Court noted that the three police officers and the investigating judge who had examined O. and P. at the pre-trial stage had all testified at the trial that they had found O. and P. to be credible.\n41: The Regional Court stressed that since neither the defence nor the court itself had had an opportunity to observe the main witnesses’ demeanour at the trial or during examination by means of an audio-visual link, it had to exercise particular diligence in assessing the evaluation of the witnesses’ credibility by the police officers and the investigating judge. The court further emphasised that when taking into account the testimonies given by the witnesses’ neighbour E. and their friend L. it had paid special attention to the fact that their statements constituted hearsay evidence and had to be assessed particularly carefully.\n42: In this context it had been of relevance that O.’s and P.’s testimonies as well as the statements of the additional witnesses heard at the trial, had been supported by further significant and admissible evidence such as data and information obtained by tapping the applicant’s and the co-accused’s mobile telephones and by means of a GPS receiver. The information in question had been gathered in the context of police surveillance measures carried out at the relevant time in the criminal investigation initiated against the accused on suspicion of racketeering and extortion on the Göttingen drug scene.\n43: It transpired from the geographical data and the recordings of two mobile-telephone conversations between one of the co-accused and the applicant on the evening of 3 February 2007 at 8.29 p.m. and 8.31 p.m. that the latter had been in the victims’ flat with B., and that he had jumped from the balcony in order to chase one of the escaping victims, whom he had failed to capture, while B. had stayed in the flat. Furthermore, an analysis of the GPS data showed that the car of one of the co-accused had been parked near the crime scene from 7.58 p.m. to 8.32 p.m. on the evening of 3 February 2007, a period that coincided with the time frame in which the robbery in question had occurred.\n44: Furthermore, while the applicant and the co-accused had denied any participation in the robbery as such or any premeditated criminal activity, their own statements at the trial had at least confirmed that one of the coaccused, together with R., had visited the victims’ flat in Göttingen on the evening before the offence and that they had all been in the car parked close to the victims’ flat at the time of the offence. The accused had initially stated that a different perpetrator and R. had been in the flat at the time of the incident the following day. The applicant had subsequently amended his submissions and claimed that it had been he and B. who had gone into the victims’ flat on 3 February 2007 with a view to making use of the women’s services as prostitutes. He had further conceded that he had followed P. when she escaped over the balcony. He explained that he had done so in order to prevent her from calling the neighbours or the police, since, in view of his criminal record, he had been afraid of getting into trouble and because of the problems he had previously encountered with prostitutes on a similar occasion in Kassel.\n45: Finally, the Regional Court considered that the very similar way in which the offences had been committed against two female victims, foreign nationals working as prostitutes in a flat, was an additional element indicating that the applicant had also participated in the offence committed in Göttingen.\n46: In the Regional Court’s view, the body of evidence, taken together, gave a coherent and complete overall picture of events which supported the version provided by O. and P. and refuted the contradictory versions of events put forward by the applicant and his co-accused in the course of the trial.\n47: On 23 June 2008 the applicant, represented by counsel, lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of the Göttingen Regional Court. He complained that he had not been able to examine the only direct and key witnesses to the offence committed in Göttingen at any stage of the proceedings, in breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention. As the prosecution authorities, contrary to the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice (the applicant referred to a judgment of 25 July 2000, see paragraphs 58-59 and 62 below), had not requested that defence counsel be appointed for him prior to O.’s and P.’s hearing before the investigating judge, their statements ought to have been excluded from the trial.\n48: In written submissions dated 9 September 2008, the Federal Public Prosecutor General requested that the applicant’s appeal on points of law be dismissed by the Federal Court of Justice as manifestly ill-founded in written proceedings, under Article 349 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 63 below). The Federal Public Prosecutor General argued that, while it was true that the proceedings had been characterised by a “complete loss” of the applicant’s right to examine O. and P. (Totalausfall des Fragerechts), they had as a whole been fair and there had been no reason to exclude the witness statements of O. and P. as evidence.\n49: The Federal Public Prosecutor General considered that the Regional Court had assessed the content of the records of the witnesses’ testimonies read out at the trial particularly carefully and critically. Furthermore, the victims’ statements had been neither the sole nor the decisive basis for the applicant’s conviction by the Regional Court, as the latter had based its findings on further significant evidence. In view of the various layers of corroborating evidence, the applicant had had ample opportunity to challenge the credibility of the two prosecution witnesses and to defend himself effectively.\n50: Endorsing the Regional Court’s reasoning, the Federal Public Prosecutor General further pointed out that there was nothing to demonstrate that the restrictions on the defence’s right to examine O. and P. had been imputable to the domestic authorities. The prosecution authorities had not been obliged to appoint counsel for the applicant in order for counsel to participate in the hearing by the investigating judge. In view of the witnesses’ consistent cooperation, the authorities had had no reason to suspect that, despite their return to their home country, they would no longer be available for questioning at the trial, especially as they had been obliged under Latvian law to at least participate in a hearing via video-link.\n51: By a decision of 30 October 2008, the Federal Court of Justice, referring to Article 349 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as manifestly ill-founded.\n52: In its decision of 9 December 2008 rejecting the applicant’s complaint concerning a violation of his right to be heard (Anhörungsrüge), the Federal Court of Justice pointed out that any decision dismissing an appeal on the basis of Article 349 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure necessarily entailed a reference to the reasoned application by the Federal Public Prosecutor General.\n53: In a constitutional complaint dated 30 December 2008 against the decisions of the Federal Court of Justice of 30 October and 9 December 2008, the applicant complained, in particular, that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial and of his defence rights under Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention. He argued that neither he nor his counsel had had the opportunity to question O. and P. at any stage of the proceedings.\n54: By a decision of 8 October 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court, without providing reasons, declined to consider the applicant’s complaint (file no. 2 BvR 78/09).\n55: Article 160 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that, in investigating the facts relating to a suspicion that a criminal offence has been committed, the public prosecution authorities must investigate not only the incriminating but also the exonerating circumstances and must ensure that evidence which might be lost is taken.\n56: Under Article 168c § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the prosecutor, the accused and defence counsel are authorised to be present during the judicial examination of a witness prior to the opening of the main proceedings. The judge may exclude an accused from the hearing if his or her presence would endanger the purpose of the investigation, in particular if there is a risk that a witness will not tell the truth in the presence of the accused (Article 168c § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The persons entitled to be present must be given prior notice of the dates set for the hearings. Notification may be dispensed with if it would endanger the success of the investigation (Article 168c § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).\n57: In accordance with Article 141 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, defence counsel may be appointed during the investigation proceedings. The public prosecutor’s office requests such appointment if, in its opinion, the assistance of defence counsel in the main proceedings will be mandatory. The assistance of defence counsel is mandatory if, inter alia, the main hearing is held at first instance before the Regional Court or the accused is charged with a serious criminal offence (Article 140 § 1 (1) and (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure).\n58: In a leading judgment of 25 July 2000 (published in the official reports, BGHSt, volume 46, pp. 96 et seq.), the Federal Court of Justice found that Article 141 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, interpreted in the light of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention, obliged the investigating authorities to consider the appointment of counsel for an unrepresented accused if the key witness for the prosecution was to testify before an investigating judge for the purpose of securing evidence and the accused was excluded from that hearing.\n59: The Federal Court of Justice stressed that respect for the right to cross-examination required that the appointed counsel be given an opportunity to discuss the matter with the accused prior to the witness’s examination by the investigating judge, in order to be in a position to ask the relevant questions. The court also noted that it might not be necessary to appoint a lawyer for the accused if there were justifiable reasons not to notify counsel of the hearing before the investigating judge or if the delay caused by appointing and involving a lawyer would endanger the success of the investigation. In the case before it, the Federal Court of Justice further did not have to determine whether it was necessary to appoint counsel for the accused when the purpose of the investigation might be endangered simply as a result of the lawyer discussing the matter with the accused prior to the hearing.\n60: Article 250 of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down the principle according to which, where the proof of a fact is based on a person’s observation, that person must be examined at the trial. The examination must not be replaced by reading out the record of a previous examination or a written statement.\n61: Article 251 of the Code of Criminal Procedure contains a number of exceptions to that principle. Under Article 251 § 1 (2), the examination of a witness may be replaced by reading out a record of another examination if the witness has died or cannot be examined by the court for another reason within a foreseeable period of time. Article 251 § 2 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that, in the event of previous examination by a judge, the examination of a witness may be replaced by reading out the written record of his or her previous examination; this also applies if illness, infirmity or other insurmountable obstacles prevent the witness from appearing at the main hearing for a long or indefinite period.\n62: In its above-mentioned judgment of 25 July 2000 (see paragraphs 58-59 above), the Federal Court of Justice found that the failure to appoint counsel for the accused as required by Article 141 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not result in the exclusion of the evidence obtained during examination by the investigating judge, but did diminish its evidentiary value. Regard had to be had to the proceedings as a whole. As a rule, a conviction could be based on the statement of a witness whom the defence had been unable to cross-examine only if the statement was corroborated by other significant factors independent of it. The trial court was further obliged to assess the evidence with particular care, also having regard to the fact that the statement made by the investigating judge at the trial constituted hearsay evidence.\n63: Under Article 349 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the court deciding on the appeal on points of law may, on a reasoned application by the public prosecutor’s office, dismiss a defendant’s appeal on points of law without a hearing if it considers the appeal to be manifestly ill-founded. The decision must be unanimous.\n64: Mutual assistance in criminal matters between Germany and Latvia is governed, in particular, by the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 20 April 1959 (ETS 30), supplemented by the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union of 29 May 2000.\n65: Article 10 of the latter Convention provides for the possibility of hearing witnesses by video-conference. Such hearings must be carried out in the presence of and by a judicial authority of the requested member State. The witness may claim the right not to testify which would accrue to him or her under the law of either the requested or the requesting member State (Article 10 § 5). Each member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that, where witnesses are being heard within its territory and refuse to do so when under an obligation to testify, its national law applies in the same way as if the hearing took place in a national procedure (Article 10 § 8).\n66: Article 8 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 20 April 1959 provides that a witness who has failed to answer a summons to appear issued by the requesting Party shall not be subjected to any punishment unless subsequently he or she voluntarily enters the territory of the requesting Party and is there again duly summoned.\n67: The applicant complained that his trial had been unfair and that the principle of equality of arms had been infringed since neither he nor his lawyer had been granted an opportunity at any stage of the criminal proceedings to examine O. and P., the only direct witnesses to and victims of the offence allegedly committed by him in Göttingen in February 2007. He relied on Article 6 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n68: The Government contested that argument.\n69: The Chamber held that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.\n70: Applying the principles established by the Court in its judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, ECHR 2011), the Chamber found that there had been a good reason for the witnesses’ non-attendance at the trial. The Regional Court had made reasonable efforts to enable the witnesses to be examined. The fact that all attempts in this regard had been futile was not imputable to that court. The Chamber further considered that, while the witness statements in issue may not have been the sole or decisive evidence on which the applicant’s conviction was based, they clearly carried considerable weight in the establishment of his guilt.\n71: However, in the Chamber’s view, there had been sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for the difficulties under which the defence laboured as a result of the admission of the victims’ witness statements. It considered that the Regional Court had complied with the procedural safeguards under domestic law. Under Article 168c of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 56 above), the accused and defence counsel were, as a rule, permitted to be present during the judicial examination of a witness at the pre-trial stage. However, it had been justified to exclude the applicant, who had not yet been assigned a lawyer at that time, from the hearing of O. and P. by the investigating judge in accordance with Article 168c § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The investigating judge’s concern that the suspects would put pressure on the witnesses once they or counsel were informed of the hearing, thus jeopardising the ongoing investigations, had been well-founded. The Chamber also took note of the Government’s submission that, at the time of the hearing, it had not been foreseeable that the witnesses, who had already given evidence on several occasions, would refuse to testify at the trial.\n72: Moreover, the Chamber noted that the Regional Court had thoroughly scrutinised O.’s and P.’s witness statements in the light of their reduced evidentiary value. That court had also had regard to the statements of two witnesses, E. and L., in whom the victims had confided directly after the incident. The coherent witness testimonies had been supported by factual evidence obtained by telephone tapping, by GPS surveillance and by the applicant’s own admission that he had been in the victims’ flat at the time of the incident. Moreover, the similarity in the way in which the offences in Kassel and Göttingen had been committed had further corroborated the court’s findings. The proceedings as a whole had therefore been fair.\n73: In the applicant’s submission, his right to a fair trial, including the right to examine witnesses against him under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, had been breached. He stressed that neither he nor his counsel had had the opportunity, at any stage of the proceedings, to examine the key witnesses O. and P.\n74: In his observations before the Grand Chamber, the applicant agreed that the principles developed by the Court in Al-Khawaja and Tahery (cited above) were applicable to his case. He stressed that, according to that caselaw, failure to give the defence an opportunity to cross-examine a prosecution witness would result in a breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention save in exceptional circumstances.\n75: In the applicant’s submission, there had not been a good reason for the non-attendance of O. and P. at his trial. The psychological difficulties allegedly caused by the offence in Göttingen had not prevented the witnesses from making statements to the police and the investigating judge at the investigation stage. Moreover, the Göttingen Regional Court had itself considered that there had not been sufficient reason for the witnesses not to attend the trial. Further attempts should have been made by the domestic authorities to obtain the hearing of those witnesses at the trial, notably by means of bilateral negotiations with Latvia at the political level.\n76: In the applicant’s view, his conviction had been based at least to a decisive extent on the evidence given by O. and P., who had been the only eyewitnesses to the events in Göttingen. He could not have been found guilty on the basis of the other available evidence if the evidence provided by O. and P. had been disregarded.\n77: The applicant took the view that there had not been any counterbalancing factors to compensate for the difficulties caused to the defence as a result of the witnesses’ absence at the trial.\n78: The applicant submitted that the Regional Court had not assessed the witness statements made by O. and P. with particular caution. It had not taken into account the fact that the witnesses’ failure to attend the hearing before it without an adequate excuse had affected their credibility. Moreover, the fact that there had been some additional hearsay evidence and that the applicant had had the opportunity to question the investigating judge had not constituted sufficient counterbalancing factors to secure equality of arms in the proceedings. The fact that, under German criminal procedure law, the prosecution was obliged to investigate both the incriminating and the exonerating evidence against the accused (see paragraph 55 above) did not compensate for his lack of opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses, as the prosecution authorities had not investigated the exonerating evidence in his case.\n79: The applicant stressed, in particular, that he had been deprived of a procedural safeguard under domestic law aimed at protecting his defence rights, in that counsel representing him had not been allowed to be present at the hearing of O. and P. before the investigating judge. Under the applicable provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Article 141 § 3 taken in conjunction with Article 140, see paragraph 57 above), as interpreted by the Federal Court of Justice (he referred to that court’s judgment of 25 July 2000, see paragraphs 58-59 and 62 above), the prosecution had been obliged to appoint counsel to represent him at the stage of the investigation proceedings. This should have been done prior to the hearing of the main witnesses for the prosecution by the investigating judge, from which he had been excluded under Article 168c § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In such circumstances, defence counsel had a right to be present at the witness hearing under Article 168c § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (save in the circumstances enumerated in Article 168c § 5, which did not apply to his case). He referred to the findings in the Court’s judgment in Hümmer v. Germany (no. 26171/07, §§ 42 et seq., 19 July 2012) in support of his submission.\n80: The applicant stressed that, in practice, witnesses were only heard by the investigating judge in the investigation proceedings, in addition to their examination by the police, if there was a danger of evidence being lost. Records of examinations by an investigating judge could be read out and used as evidence at the trial under less strict conditions than records of interviews by the police (Article 251 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, see paragraph 61 above). The presence of the accused and counsel at hearings conducted by an investigating judge in accordance with Article 168c § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was thus essential in order to safeguard the accused’s right under Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.\n81: In the applicant’s submission, it had not been justified to deny him that right simply because the investigating judge had gained the mistaken impression that the witnesses had been afraid to testify in the applicant’s and even his counsel’s presence, without him having given cause for any such fears. In any event, this would not have justified his and his counsel’s exclusion from that hearing as there were various means of allaying such fears. As O. and P. were due to leave Germany shortly after their hearing by the investigating judge, it would have been possible to appoint counsel for the applicant just before the hearing and also to arrest the applicant immediately before that hearing, thus allowing him or at least his counsel to question the witnesses in person without the latter having to fear any intimidation.\n82: In the applicant’s view, the likelihood that O. and P., who had possibly been liable to punishment under the trade or tax laws because of their work as prostitutes, would no longer be available to testify in Germany in the proceedings against him had been foreseeable for the investigating authorities. He nevertheless stressed that he had not had any reason to request a repetition of the witnesses’ hearing by the investigating judge in his presence following his arrest as he had assumed that he would be able to cross-examine the witnesses at the trial; the witnesses had in any event already left Germany at the time of his arrest.\n83: In the Government’s submission, the criminal proceedings against the applicant had complied with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention despite the fact that the applicant had not had the opportunity to crossexamine O. and P. at any stage of the proceedings.\n84: In the Government’s view, there was no reason to tighten or amend the principles established by the Court in its judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery (cited above), which were applicable to the present case and according to which the cross-examination of witnesses could be dispensed with in certain circumstances. The Court’s findings in that judgment, made in the context of a common-law system, should be transposed to continental-law systems in a flexible manner. Even if these principles were applied, the scope for exceptions to the principle of cross-examination was liable to be wider in continental-law systems such as the German legal system. The latter relied to a greater extent on professional judges experienced in evaluating the reliability of evidence, and the assessment of the evidence was made far more transparent in the reasoning of the judgments.\n85: The Government added that a comparative-law study commissioned by them had shown that in none of the Contracting Parties to the Convention with a criminal-law system comparable to the German system was there an unrestricted right for the defendant to cross-examine prosecution witnesses at the hearing. Moreover, in many other legal systems it was not prohibited to have recourse to the records of previous witness examinations even if the accused had been unable to question the witness concerned at that stage.\n86: In the Government’s view, there had been a good reason, as defined by the Court’s case-law, for the non-attendance of O. and P. at the trial. The Regional Court had made all reasonable efforts to hear the witnesses, who had resided and worked legally in Germany, in person at the trial or to examine them via video-conference with the help of the Latvian courts. It had summoned the witnesses for a hearing and, following the submission of medical certificates by the witnesses, had again attempted to secure their presence by informing them that they would be protected and asking them to state in which circumstances they would be prepared to testify. The Regional Court had no jurisdiction to compel the witnesses, who were Latvian nationals residing in Latvia, to attend a hearing in Germany, as coercive measures were prohibited under Article 8 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (see paragraph 66 above).\n87: The Government submitted that the Regional Court had then asked the Latvian authorities, by way of legal assistance in accordance with the applicable rules, to have the witnesses summoned by a court in Latvia so that they could be examined via video-conference. However, the Latvian court had cancelled the hearing following a preliminary discussion with the witnesses, who had again submitted medical certificates. The Regional Court’s request to the Latvian court asking the latter to verify the grounds given by the witnesses for their refusal to testify, or to explore further ways of questioning them, had gone unanswered. There was nothing to indicate that the hearing of the witnesses could have been brought about by different means such as bilateral negotiations on a political level, mentioned for the first time by the applicant in the proceedings before the Court.\n88: The Government submitted that in the Regional Court’s view, which was decisive in that respect, the witness statements made by O. and P. had been “relevant” (maßgeblich) in grounding the applicant’s conviction. However, there had also been a number of other weighty items of evidence, including the results of police surveillance measures and the applicant’s own submissions, which had allowed the veracity of the witness statements to be tested. The question whether the witness evidence in issue, in the light of these elements, amounted to “decisive evidence” for the purposes of the Court’s case-law could be left open because, in any event, sufficient counterbalancing factors had been both necessary and present in the applicant’s case to compensate for the defence’s lack of opportunity to question the witnesses.\n89: In the Government’s submission, the impossibility for the applicant to question O. and P. had been sufficiently compensated for by the Regional Court, which had made a comprehensive and critical assessment of the credibility of the witness statements. The Regional Court had assessed with particular caution the evidence given by the two witnesses for the prosecution, inter alia, by comparing the statements made by them during their different examinations.\n90: The Government argued that in German criminal proceedings both the court and the prosecution were obliged by law to investigate both the incriminating and the exonerating evidence against the accused. This partly compensated for an accused’s lack of opportunity to cross-examine a prosecution witness.\n91: In testing the veracity of the witness statements, the Regional Court had also had recourse to a large number of corroborating evidentiary elements, including both hearsay witness evidence and reliable physical evidence obtained by means of surveillance of the applicant. The surveillance measures had included, in particular, analysis of the geographical data from the applicant’s mobile phone and the recording of his telephone conversation with one of his co-accused at the time of the offence, in which he had described one of the witnesses jumping down from a balcony and hiding from the applicant, who had pursued her.\n92: Moreover, the applicant had had the opportunity to cross-examine and challenge the credibility of almost all the persons who had questioned O. and P. at the investigation stage; the Regional Court had also heard evidence from those persons concerning the witnesses’ conduct and emotional state during questioning.\n93: As to the fact that neither the applicant nor his counsel had been given an opportunity to question O. and P. at the investigation stage, the Government argued that the investigating judge had excluded the applicant from the hearing in accordance with Article 168c § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in order to ensure the witnesses’ protection and the establishment of the truth. The witnesses, who had been very frightened of the perpetrators, would not have made complete and truthful statements about the offence in the presence of the applicant. They had had legitimate grounds for their fear of acts of revenge, given that the applicant had been suspected of committing a similar robbery in Kassel.\n94: Moreover, as the witnesses would have had reason to fear that any defence counsel appointed to represent the applicant would inform the latter of the hearing and of their statements made therein, they would not have made any, or accurate, statements in counsel’s presence either. The Government explained that, under Article 168c § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court was authorised to dispense with notifying any lawyer appointed for the applicant of the hearing if it considered that notification would endanger the success of the investigation. Therefore, in accordance with the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice (they also referred to that court’s judgment of 25 July 2000, see paragraphs 58-59 and 62 above), the appointment of defence counsel and the latter’s presence at the hearing before the investigating judge were not required.\n95: The Government noted that, following his arrest, the applicant had not requested a repetition of the witnesses’ examination in his presence in the investigation proceedings. They stressed that it had not been foreseeable that O. and P. would not attend the trial since the applicant and his accomplices, who were in detention at that stage, would then have posed less of a threat to them. In any event, the applicant had never lodged any applications stating which questions he would have liked to put to the witnesses, whose identity and whereabouts had been known to him, or on what grounds he might have wished to challenge their credibility.\n96: The Czech Government considered that the present case afforded the Court the opportunity to clarify and refine the principles developed in its judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery (cited above). They took the view that the principles on the admission of the evidence of absent witnesses developed therein in the context of a common-law system were not fully applicable to continental-law systems. They considered that the Court should take into account the specific features of the particular legal system concerned.\n97: The Czech Government suggested that the Court, prior to examining whether there were good reasons for admitting the evidence of an absent witness (they referred to Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 120), should verify whether the impugned evidence had been the sole or decisive evidence grounding the accused’s conviction, as it had done, for instance, in Sarkizov and Others v. Bulgaria (nos. 37981/06 and 3 others, § 58, 17 April 2012) and Damir Sibgatullin v. Russia (no. 1413/05, §§ 54-56, 24 April 2012). They argued that in a situation where a statement by an absent witness was not decisive, proof of a good reason for not affording the defence the possibility of questioning the witness was unnecessary. Furthermore, the Court should clarify whether it still accepted the principle of impossibilium nulla obligatio est as a good reason for admitting the evidence of an absent witness. This was particularly relevant in cases where a witness had left the national courts’ jurisdiction, as the latter then lacked the coercive power to secure the witness’s presence at a trial.\n98: The Czech Government further stressed that it was for the national courts to assess the significance of a witness statement for the outcome of the case. A detailed analysis by the Court of the decisiveness or degree of importance of the evidence in question was liable to come into conflict with the domestic authorities’ margin of appreciation and the Court’s fourth-instance doctrine.\n99: In the Czech Government’s submission, the more flexible approach adopted by the Court in Al-Khawaja and Tahery (cited above) in respect of sole or decisive evidence made its case-law less predictable. They proposed that the Court should clarify which counterbalancing factors would be considered sufficient for preventing a breach of Article 6 of the Convention.\n100: The Court reiterates that the guarantees in paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of this provision (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 118); it will therefore consider the applicant’s complaint under both provisions taken together (see Windisch v. Austria, 27 September 1990, § 23, Series A no. 186, and Lüdi v. Switzerland, 15 June 1992, § 43, Series A no. 238).\n101: The Court’s primary concern under Article 6 § 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see, inter alia, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, § 84, ECHR 2010, with further references). In making this assessment, the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interest of the public and the victims in seeing crime properly prosecuted (see Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, §§ 163 and 175, ECHR 2010) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 118, with further references, and Hümmer, cited above, § 37).\n102: The principles to be applied in cases where a prosecution witness did not attend the trial and statements previously made by him were admitted as evidence have been summarised and refined in the judgment of the Grand Chamber of 15 December 2011 in Al-Khawaja and Tahery (cited above).\n103: The Court reiterated in that judgment that Article 6 § 3 (d) enshrined the principle that, before an accused could be convicted, all evidence against him normally had to be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 118).\n104: The Court must stress, in that context, the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, § 54, ECHR 2008). Even if the primary purpose of Article 6 of the Convention, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, is to ensure a fair trial by a “tribunal” competent to determine “any criminal charge”, it does not follow that the Article has no application to pre-trial proceedings. Thus, Article 6 – especially paragraph 3 thereof – may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (see Salduz, cited above, § 50, referring to Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, § 36, Series A no. 275).\n105: However, the use as evidence of statements obtained at the stage of a police inquiry and judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d), provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him – either when that witness is making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 118, with further references; see also A.G. v. Sweden (dec.), no. 315/09, 10 January 2012, and Trampevski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 4570/07, § 44, 10 July 2012).\n106: In its judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, the Court concluded that the admission as evidence of the statement of a witness who had been absent from the trial and whose pre-trial statement was the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant did not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 § 1. It reasoned that applying in an inflexible manner the so-called “sole or decisive rule” (under which a trial was unfair if a conviction was based solely or to a decisive extent on evidence provided by a witness whom the accused had been unable to question at any stage of the proceedings – ibid., §§ 128 and 147) would run counter to the traditional way in which the Court approached the right to a fair hearing under Article 6 § 1, namely to examine whether the proceedings as a whole had been fair. However, the admission of such evidence, because of the inherent risks for the fairness of the trial, constituted a very important factor to balance in the scales (ibid., §§ 146-47).\n107: According to the principles developed in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, it is necessary to examine in three steps the compatibility with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention of proceedings in which statements made by a witness who had not been present and questioned at the trial were used as evidence (ibid., § 152). The Court must examine\n108: As regards the applicability of the above principles in the context of the diverse legal systems in the Contracting States, and in particular in the context of both common-law and continental-law systems, the Court reiterates that, while it is important for it to have regard to substantial differences in legal systems and procedures, including different approaches to the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials, ultimately it must apply the same standard of review under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) irrespective of the legal system from which a case emanates (ibid., § 130).\n109: Furthermore, in cases arising from individual applications, the Court’s task is not to review the relevant legislation in the abstract. Instead, it must confine itself, as far as possible, to examining the issues raised by the case before it (see, among many other authorities, N.C. v. Italy [GC], no. 24952/94, § 56, ECHR 2002X, and Taxquet, cited above, § 83). When examining cases, the Court is of course mindful of the differences between the legal systems of the Contracting Parties to the Convention when it comes to matters such as the admission of evidence of an absent witness and the corresponding need for safeguards to ensure the fairness of the proceedings. It will have due regard in the instant case to such differences when examining, in particular, whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for the handicaps caused to the defence as a result of the admission of the untested witness evidence (compare Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 146).\n110: The Court considers that the application of the principles developed in Al-Khawaja and Tahery in its subsequent case-law discloses a need to clarify the relationship between the above-mentioned three steps of the AlKhawaja and Tahery test when it comes to the examination of the compliance with the Convention of a trial in which untested incriminating witness evidence was admitted. It is clear that each of the three steps of the test must be examined if – as in Al-Khawaja and Tahery – the questions in steps one (whether there was a good reason for the non-attendance of the witness) and two (whether the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or decisive basis for the defendant’s conviction) are answered in the affirmative (see AlKhawaja and Tahery, cited above, §§ 120 and 147). The Court is, however, called upon to clarify whether all three steps of the test must likewise be examined in cases in which either the question in step one or that in step two is answered in the negative, as well as the order in which the steps are to be examined.\n111: As to the question whether the lack of a good reason for a witness’s non-attendance (first step of the Al-Khawaja and Tahery test) entails, by itself, a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, without it being necessary to examine the second and third steps of the Al-Khawaja and Tahery test, the Court observes the following. In its judgment in AlKhawaja and Tahery, it considered that the requirement that there be a good reason for admitting the evidence of an absent witness was a “preliminary question” which had to be examined before any consideration was given as to whether that evidence was sole or decisive (ibid., § 120). It further noted that it had found violations of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) even in cases in which the evidence of an absent witness had been neither sole nor decisive, when no good reason had been shown for the failure to have the witness examined (ibid., with further references).\n112: The Court observes that the requirement to provide a justification for not calling a witness has been developed in its case-law in connection with the question whether the defendant’s conviction was solely or to a decisive extent based on evidence provided by an absent witness (see AlKhawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 128). It further reiterates that the rationale underlying its judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, in which it departed from the so-called “sole or decisive rule”, was to abandon an indiscriminate rule and to have regard, in the traditional way, to the fairness of the proceedings as a whole (ibid., §§ 146-47). However, it would amount to the creation of a new indiscriminate rule if a trial were considered to be unfair for lack of a good reason for a witness’s non-attendance alone, even if the untested evidence was neither sole nor decisive and was possibly even irrelevant for the outcome of the case.\n113: The Court notes that in a number of cases following the delivery of the judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery it took an overall approach to the examination of the fairness of the trial, having regard to all three steps of the Al-Khawaja and Tahery test (see Salikhov v. Russia, no. 23880/05, §§ 11819, 3 May 2012; Asadbeyli and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 3653/05 and 5 others, § 134, 11 December 2012; Yevgeniy Ivanov v. Russia, no. 27100/03, §§ 45-50, 25 April 2013; and Şandru v. Romania, no. 33882/05, §§ 62-70, 15 October 2013). However, in other cases, the lack of a good reason for a prosecution witness’s absence alone was considered sufficient to find a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) (see Rudnichenko v. Ukraine, no. 2775/07, §§ 10510, 11 July 2013, and Nikolitsas v. Greece, no. 63117/09, § 35, 3 July 2014; in the latter case the Court nevertheless addressed the others steps of the AlKhawaja and Tahery test, ibid., §§ 36-39). In yet other cases a differentiated approach was taken: the lack of good reason for a prosecution witness’s absence was considered conclusive of the unfairness of the trial unless the witness testimony was manifestly irrelevant for the outcome of the case (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, §§ 709-16, 25 July 2013; Cevat Soysal v. Turkey, no. 17362/03, §§ 76-79, 23 September 2014; and Suldin v. Russia, no. 20077/04, §§ 56-59, 16 October 2014). The Grand Chamber, in the light of the foregoing (see paragraphs 111-12 above), considers that the absence of good reason for the non-attendance of a witness cannot of itself be conclusive of the unfairness of a trial. This being said, the lack of a good reason for a prosecution witness’s absence is a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness of a trial, and one which may tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d).\n114: In its judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery the Court addressed the requirement of the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors to secure a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of the evidence in the context of cases in which convictions were based solely or to a decisive extent on the evidence of absent witnesses (ibid., § 147).\n115: As regards the question whether it is necessary to review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors even in cases in which the importance of an absent witness’s evidence did not attain the threshold of sole or decisive evidence grounding the applicant’s conviction, the Court reiterates that it has generally considered it necessary to carry out an examination of the overall fairness of the proceedings. This has traditionally included an examination of both the significance of the untested evidence for the case against the accused and of the counterbalancing measures taken by the judicial authorities to compensate for the handicaps under which the defence laboured (see Gani v. Spain, no. 61800/08, § 41, 19 February 2013, with further references; see also Fąfrowicz v. Poland, no. 43609/07, §§ 5863, 17 April 2012; Sellick and Sellick v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 18743/06, §§ 54-55, 16 October 2012 (concerning evidence of absent witnesses characterised as “important”); Beggs v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 15499/10, §§ 156-59, 16 October 2012 (concerning absent witness evidence characterised as only one piece of circumstantial evidence); Štefančič v. Slovenia, no. 18027/05, §§ 42-47, 25 October 2012 (concerning evidence by an absent witness classified as one out of several elements on which the applicant’s conviction was based); and Garofolo v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 4380/09, §§ 52 and 56-57, 2 April 2013; but see also Matytsina v. Russia, no. 58428/10, §§ 164-65, 27 March 2014, and Horncastle and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 4184/10, §§ 150-51, 16 December 2014 (in both of which, in view of the low level of importance of the absent witness’s testimony, the existence of counterbalancing factors was not examined).\n116: Given that the Court’s concern is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, it must review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors not only in cases in which the evidence given by an absent witness was the sole or decisive basis for the applicant’s conviction but also in those cases where, following its assessment of the domestic courts’ evaluation of the weight of the evidence (described in more detail in paragraph 124 below), it finds it unclear whether the evidence in question was the sole or decisive basis but is nevertheless satisfied that it carried significant weight and that its admission may have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair will depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors will have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair.\n117: The Court observes that in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, the requirement that there be a good reason for the non-attendance of the witness (first step), and for the consequent admission of the evidence of the absent witness, was considered as a preliminary question which had to be examined before any consideration was given as to whether that evidence was sole or decisive (second step – ibid., § 120). “Preliminary”, in that context, may be understood in a temporal sense: the trial court must first decide whether there is good reason for the absence of the witness and whether, as a consequence, the evidence of the absent witness may be admitted. Only once that witness evidence is admitted can the trial court assess, at the close of the trial and having regard to all the evidence adduced, the significance of the evidence of the absent witness and, in particular, whether the evidence of the absent witness is the sole or decisive basis for convicting the defendant. It will then depend on the weight of the evidence given by the absent witness how much weight the counterbalancing factors (third step) will have to carry in order to ensure the overall fairness of the trial.\n118: Against that background, it will, as a rule, be pertinent to examine the three steps of the Al-Khawaja and Tahery test in the order defined in that judgment (see paragraph 107 above). However, all three steps of the test are interrelated and, taken together, serve to establish whether the criminal proceedings issue have, as a whole, been fair. It may therefore be appropriate, in a given case, to examine the steps in a different order, in particular if one of the steps proves to be particularly conclusive as to either the fairness or the unfairness of the proceedings (see in this connection, for instance, Nechto v. Russia, no. 24893/05, §§ 119-25 and 126-27, 24 January 2012; Mitkus v. Latvia, no. 7259/03, §§ 101-02 and 106, 2 October 2012; Gani, cited above, §§ 43-45; and Şandru, cited above, §§ 62-66, in all of which the second step, that is, the question whether the evidence of the absent witness was sole or decisive, was examined before the first step, that is, the question whether there was a good reason for the witness’s absence).\n119: Good reason for the absence of a witness must exist from the trial court’s perspective, that is, the court must have had good factual or legal grounds not to secure the witness’s attendance at the trial. If there was a good reason for the witness’s non-attendance in that sense, it follows that there was a good reason, or justification, for the trial court to admit the untested statements of the absent witness as evidence. There are a number of reasons why a witness may not attend a trial, such as absence owing to death or fear (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, §§ 120-25), absence on health grounds (see, for instance, Bobeş v. Romania, no. 29752/05, § 39, 9 July 2013; Vronchenko v. Estonia, no. 59632/09, § 58, 18 July 2013; and Matytsina, cited above, § 163) or the witness’s unreachability.\n120: In cases concerning a witness’s absence owing to unreachability, the Court requires the trial court to have made all reasonable efforts to secure the witness’s attendance (see Gabrielyan v. Armenia, no. 8088/05, § 78, 10 April 2012; Tseber v. the Czech Republic, no. 46203/08, § 48, 22 November 2012; and Kostecki v. Poland, no. 14932/09, §§ 65-66, 4 June 2013). The fact that the domestic courts were unable to locate the witness concerned or the fact that a witness was absent from the country in which the proceedings were conducted was found not to be sufficient in itself to satisfy the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (d), which requires the Contracting States to take positive steps to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him (see Gabrielyan, cited above, § 81; Tseber, cited above, § 48; and Lučić v. Croatia, no. 5699/11, § 79, 27 February 2014). Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States have to exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see Gabrielyan, cited above, § 81, with further references). Otherwise, the witness’s absence is imputable to the domestic authorities (see Tseber, cited above, § 48, and Lučić, cited above, § 79).\n121: It is not for the Court to compile a list of specific measures which the domestic courts must have taken in order to have made all reasonable efforts to secure the attendance of a witness whom they finally considered to be unreachable (see Tseber, cited above, § 49). However, it is clear that they must have actively searched for the witness with the help of the domestic authorities, including the police (see Salikhov, cited above, §§ 116-17; Prăjină v. Romania, no. 5592/05, § 47, 7 January 2014; and Lučić, cited above, § 79) and must, as a rule, have resorted to international legal assistance where a witness resided abroad and such mechanisms were available (see Gabrielyan, § 83; Fąfrowicz, § 56; Lučić, § 80; and Nikolitsas, § 35, all cited above).\n122: The need for all reasonable efforts on the part of the authorities to secure the witness’s attendance at the trial further implies careful scrutiny by the domestic courts of the reasons given for the witness’s inability to attend trial, having regard to the specific situation of each witness (see Nechto, § 127; Damir Sibgatullin, § 56; and Yevgeniy Ivanov, § 47, all cited above).\n123: As regards the question whether the evidence of the absent witness whose statements were admitted in evidence was the sole or decisive basis for the defendant’s conviction (second step of the Al-Khawaja and Tahery test), the Court reiterates that “sole” evidence is to be understood as the only evidence against the accused (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 131). “Decisive” evidence should be narrowly interpreted as indicating evidence of such significance or importance as is likely to be determinative of the outcome of the case. Where the untested evidence of a witness is supported by other corroborative evidence, the assessment of whether it is decisive will depend on the strength of the supporting evidence; the stronger the corroborative evidence, the less likely that the evidence of the absent witness will be treated as decisive (ibid.).\n124: As it is not for the Court to act as a court of fourth instance (see Nikolitsas, cited above, § 30), its starting-point for deciding whether an applicant’s conviction was based solely or to a decisive extent on the depositions of an absent witness is the judgments of the domestic courts (see Beggs, § 156; Kostecki, § 67; and Horncastle and Others, §§ 141 and 150, all cited above). The Court must review the domestic courts’ evaluation in the light of the meaning it has given to “sole” and “decisive” evidence and ascertain for itself whether the domestic courts’ evaluation of the weight of the evidence was unacceptable or arbitrary (see McGlynn v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 40612/11, § 23, 16 October 2012, and Garofolo, cited above, §§ 52-53). It must further make its own assessment of the weight of the evidence given by an absent witness if the domestic courts did not indicate their position on that issue or if their position is not clear (see Fąfrowicz, cited above, § 58; Pichugin v. Russia, no. 38623/03, §§ 196-200, 23 October 2012; Tseber, cited above, §§ 54-56; and Nikolitsas, cited above, § 36).\n125: As to the question whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for the handicaps under which the defence laboured as a result of the admission of untested witness evidence at the trial (third step of the Al-Khawaja and Tahery test), the Court reiterates that these counterbalancing factors must permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 147).\n126: The fact that the domestic courts approached the untested evidence of an absent witness with caution has been considered by the Court to be an important safeguard (compare Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 161; Gani, cited above, § 48; and Brzuszczyński v. Poland, no. 23789/09, §§ 8586, 17 September 2013). The courts must have shown that they were aware that the statements of the absent witness carried less weight (compare, for instance, Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 157, and Bobeş, cited above, § 46). The Court has taken into account, in that context, whether the domestic courts provided detailed reasoning as to why they considered that evidence to be reliable, while having regard also to the other evidence available (see Brzuszczyński, cited above, §§ 85-86 and 89; Prăjină, cited above, § 59; and Nikolitsas, cited above, § 37). It likewise has regard to any directions given to a jury by the trial judge as to the approach to be taken to absent witnesses’ evidence (see, for instance, Sellick and Sellick, cited above, § 55).\n127: An additional safeguard in that context may be to show, at the trial hearing, a video-recording of the absent witness’s questioning at the investigation stage in order to allow the court, prosecution and defence to observe the witness’s demeanour under questioning and to form their own impression of his or her reliability (see A.G. v. Sweden, cited above; Chmura v. Poland, no. 18475/05, § 50, 3 April 2012; D.T. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 25307/10, § 50, 2 April 2013; Yevgeniy Ivanov, cited above, § 49; Rosin v. Estonia, no. 26540/08, § 62, 19 December 2013; and Gonzáles Nájera v. Spain (dec.), no. 61047/13, § 54, 11 February 2014).\n128: A further considerable safeguard is the availability at the trial of corroborative evidence supporting the untested witness statement (see, inter alia, Sică v. Romania, no. 12036/05, §§ 76-77, 9 July 2013; Brzuszczyński, cited above, § 87; and Prăjină, cited above, §§ 58 and 60). Such evidence may comprise, inter alia, statements made at the trial by persons to whom the absent witness reported the events immediately after their occurrence (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, § 156; McGlynn, § 24; D.T. v. the Netherlands, § 50; and Gonzáles Nájera, § 55, all cited above), further factual evidence secured in respect of the offence, including forensic evidence (see, for instance, McGlynn, cited above, § 24 (DNA evidence)), or expert opinions on a victim’s injuries or credibility (compare Gani, § 48; Gonzáles Nájera, § 56; and Rosin, § 61, all cited above). The Court has further considered as an important factor supporting an absent witness’s statement the fact that there were strong similarities between the absent witness’s description of the alleged offence committed against him or her and the description, given by another witness with whom there was no evidence of collusion, of a comparable offence committed by the same defendant. This holds even more true if the latter witness gave evidence at the trial and that witness’s reliability was tested by cross-examination (compare Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 156).\n129: Moreover, in cases in which a witness is absent and cannot be questioned at the trial, a significant safeguard is the possibility offered to the defence to put its own questions to the witness indirectly, for instance in writing, in the course of the trial (see Yevgeniy Ivanov, cited above, § 49, and Scholer v. Germany, no. 14212/10, § 60, 18 December 2014).\n130: Another important safeguard countering the handicaps under which the defence labours as a result of the admission of untested witness evidence at the trial is to have given the applicant or defence counsel an opportunity to question the witness during the investigation stage (see, inter alia, A.G. v. Sweden; Gani, § 48; and Şandru, § 67, all cited above). The Court has found in that context that where the investigating authorities had already taken the view at the investigation stage that a witness would not be heard at the trial, it was essential to give the defence an opportunity to have questions put to the victim during the preliminary investigation (see Rosin, cited above, §§ 57 et seq., in particular §§ 57 and 60, and Vronchenko, cited above, §§ 61 and 63, both concerning the absence at the trial of a minor victim of a sexual offence for the protection of the child’s well-being; and compare Aigner v. Austria, no. 28328/03, §§ 41-42, 10 May 2012, and Trampevski, cited above, § 45). Such pre-trial hearings are indeed often set up in order to pre-empt any risk that a crucial witness might not be available to give testimony at the trial (see Chmura, cited above, § 51).\n131: The defendant must further be afforded the opportunity to give his own version of the events and to cast doubt on the credibility of the absent witness, pointing out any incoherence or inconsistency with the statements of other witnesses (see Aigner, § 43; D.T. v. the Netherlands, § 50; Garofolo, § 56; and Gani, § 48, all cited above). Where the identity of the witness is known to the defence, the latter is able to identify and investigate any motives the witness may have for lying, and can therefore contest effectively the witness’s credibility, albeit to a lesser extent than in a direct confrontation (see Tseber, § 63; Garofolo, § 56; Sică, § 73; and Brzuszczyński, § 88, all cited above).\n132: In the present case the Court shall first examine whether there was a good reason for the non-attendance of prosecution witnesses O. and P. at the trial from the trial court’s perspective and, as a result, a good reason or justification for that court to admit the untested statements of the absent witnesses as evidence (see paragraph 119 above).\n133: In determining whether the Regional Court had good factual or legal grounds for not securing the witnesses’ attendance at the trial, the Court would note at the outset that, as rightly stressed by the applicant, the Regional Court did not accept the witnesses’ state of health or fear on their part as justification for their absence at the trial.\n134: This is demonstrated by the fact that the Regional Court, by letters of 29 August 2007, asked the witnesses, who were now residing in Latvia, to appear at the hearing although they had previously refused to comply with the court’s summons, relying on medical certificates indicating that they were in an unstable post-traumatic emotional and psychological state (see paragraphs 23-24 above). In addition, following the cancellation of the hearing by the Latvian court, before which the witnesses had again relied on medical certificates indicating that they were still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, the Regional Court indicated to the Latvian court that, according to the standards of German criminal procedure law, the witnesses had not sufficiently substantiated their refusal to testify. The Regional Court therefore suggested to the Latvian court that it have the witnesses’ state of health and ability to testify examined by a public medical officer or, alternatively, that it compel them to attend the hearing in Latvia. The Latvian court did not respond to these suggestions (see paragraphs 2627 above).\n135: It was only after these efforts to hear the witnesses in person proved futile that the Regional Court found that there were insurmountable obstacles to its hearing the witnesses in the near future. Relying on Article 251 §§ 1 (2) and 2 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it therefore admitted the records of the witnesses’ examination at the investigation stage as evidence in the proceedings (see paragraph 28 above). The reason for this measure by the Regional Court was therefore the witnesses’ unreachability for the trial court, which lacked power to compel them to appear (that is, a procedural or legal ground), and not their state of health or fear on their part (a substantive or factual ground).\n136: As required in cases concerning the absence of prosecution witnesses owing to unreachability, the Court must examine whether the trial court made all reasonable efforts to secure the witnesses’ attendance (see paragraph 120 above). It notes in this regard that the Regional Court took considerable positive steps to enable the defence, the court itself and the prosecution to examine O. and P.\n137: The Regional Court, having critically reviewed the reasons given by each witness for refusing to testify at the trial in Germany, as set out in medical certificates submitted by them, and having, as shown above, considered these reasons insufficient to justify their non-attendance, contacted the witnesses individually, offering them different options in order to testify at the trial, which the witnesses declined.\n138: The Regional Court then had recourse to international legal assistance and requested that the witnesses be summoned to appear before a Latvian court in order for the presiding judge of the Regional Court to examine them via a video-link and to enable the defence to cross-examine them. However, the hearing was cancelled by the Latvian court, which accepted the witnesses’ refusal to testify on the basis of the medical certificates they had submitted. The Regional Court, having again critically reviewed the reasons given for the witnesses’ inability to attend the trial, as mentioned above, then even suggested to the Latvian court that it have the witnesses’ state of health examined by a public medical officer or that it compel the witnesses to attend the hearing, a suggestion which received no response (see, for more detail, paragraphs 23-27 above).\n139: In view of these elements the Grand Chamber, sharing the Chamber’s conclusion in this regard, finds that the Regional Court made all reasonable efforts within the existing legal framework (see paragraphs 6466) to secure the attendance of witnesses O. and P. It did not have any other reasonable means within its jurisdiction, on the territory of Germany, to secure the attendance at the trial of O. and P., Latvian nationals residing in their home country. The Court considers, in particular, that there is nothing to indicate that the trial court would have been likely to obtain a hearing of the witnesses, within a reasonable time, following bilateral negotiations with the Republic of Latvia at the political level, as proposed by the applicant. In line with the principle impossibilium nulla est obligatio, the witnesses’ absence was thus not imputable to the domestic court.\n140: Accordingly, there was a good reason, from the trial court’s perspective, for the non-attendance of O. and P. at the trial and, as a result, for admitting as evidence the statements they had made to the police and the investigating judge at the pre-trial stage.\n141: In determining the weight of the evidence given by the absent witnesses and, in particular, whether the evidence given by them was the sole or decisive basis for the applicant’s conviction, the Court has regard, in the first place, to the domestic courts’ assessment. It observes that the Regional Court considered O. and P. to have been key witnesses for the prosecution (maßgebliche Belastungszeuginnen), but relied on further available evidence (see paragraphs 32 and 36 above). The Federal Court of Justice, for its part, in dismissing the applicant’s appeal on points of law, made a general reference to the reasoning provided by the Federal Public Prosecutor General before that court. The latter had argued that the said witness statements had been neither the sole nor the decisive basis for the applicant’s conviction, as the Regional Court had based its findings on further significant evidence (see paragraph 49 above).\n142: The Court finds that the domestic courts, which did not consider O.’s and P.’s witness statements as the sole (that is to say, only) evidence against the applicant, did not clearly indicate whether they considered the witness statements in question as “decisive” evidence as defined by the Court in its judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery (which itself was delivered after the domestic courts’ decisions in the present case), that is, as being of such significance as to be likely to be determinative of the outcome of the case (see paragraph 123 above). The Regional Court’s classification of the witnesses as “maßgeblich” (which, in addition to “key”, may also be translated as “important”, “significant” or “decisive”) is not unambiguous in this regard. Moreover, the Federal Court of Justice’s general reference to the reasoning given by the Federal Public Prosecutor General denying that the victims’ statements were the sole or decisive basis for the applicant’s conviction (see paragraph 49 above) cannot be understood as signifying that that court endorsed each and every argument made by the prosecutor.\n143: In making its own assessment of the weight of the witness evidence in the light of the domestic courts’ findings, the Court must have regard to the strength of the additional incriminating evidence available (see paragraph 123 above). It observes that the Regional Court had before it, in particular, the following further evidence concerning the offence: the hearsay statements made by the witnesses’ neighbour E. and their friend L. at the trial concerning the account O. and P. had given them of the events of 3 February 2007; the applicant’s own admission in the course of the trial that he had been in O.’s and P.’s flat at the relevant time, and had jumped from the balcony to follow P.; the geographical data and recordings of two mobile-telephone conversations between one of the co-accused and the applicant at the time of the offence, which revealed that the applicant had been in a flat at the scene of the crime and had jumped from the balcony to chase one of the escaping inhabitants; the GPS data revealing that the car of one of the co-accused had been parked near the witnesses’ flat at the relevant time; and, finally, the evidence relating to the offence committed in Kassel on 14 October 2006 by the applicant and an accomplice.\n144: The Court, having regard to these elements of evidence, cannot but note that O. and P. were the only eyewitnesses to the offence in question. The other evidence available to the courts was either hearsay evidence or merely circumstantial technical and other evidence which was not conclusive as to the robbery and extortion as such. In view of these elements, the Court considers that the evidence of the absent witnesses was “decisive”, that is, determinative of the applicant’s conviction.\n145: The Court must further determine, in a third step, whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for the handicaps under which the defence laboured as a result of the admission of the decisive evidence of the absent witnesses. As shown above (see paragraphs 125-31), the following elements are relevant in this context: the trial court’s approach to the untested evidence; the availability and strength of further incriminating evidence; and the procedural measures taken to compensate for the lack of opportunity to directly cross-examine the witnesses at the trial.\n146: As regards the domestic courts’ treatment of the evidence of O. and P., the Court observes that the Regional Court approached that evidence with caution. It expressly noted in its judgment that it had been obliged to exercise particular diligence in assessing the witnesses’ credibility, as neither the defence nor the court had been able to question and observe the demeanour of the witnesses at the trial.\n147: The Court observes in that context that the Regional Court was unable to watch at the trial a video-recording of the witness hearing before the investigating judge, since no such recording had been made. It notes that trial courts in different legal systems have recourse to that possibility (see the examples in paragraph 127 above) which allows them, as well as the defence and the prosecution, to observe a witness’s demeanour under questioning and to form a clearer impression of the witness’s credibility.\n148: The Regional Court, in its thoroughly reasoned judgment, made it clear that it was aware of the reduced evidentiary value of the untested witness statements. It compared the content of the statements made by both O. and P. at the investigation stage and found that the witnesses had given detailed and coherent descriptions of the circumstances of the offence. The trial court considered that minor contradictions in their statements could be explained by their concern not to disclose their professional activities to the authorities. It further observed that O.’s and P.’s inability to identify the applicant showed that they had not testified with a view to incriminating him.\n149: The Court further observes that the Regional Court, in assessing the witnesses’ credibility, also addressed different aspects of their conduct in relation to their statements. It took into account the fact that they had not reported the offence to the police immediately and that they had failed to attend the trial without an adequate excuse. It considered that there were explanations for that conduct – namely their fear of encountering problems with the police or of acts of revenge by the perpetrators, and their unease about having to recall and be questioned about the offence – which did not affect their credibility.\n150: In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Regional Court examined the credibility of the absent witnesses and the reliability of their statements in a careful manner. It notes in that context that its task of reviewing the trial court’s approach to the untested evidence is facilitated by the fact that the Regional Court, as is usual in a continental-law system, gave reasons for its assessment of the evidence before it.\n151: The Court further observes that the Regional Court, as shown above (see paragraphs 143-44), had before it some additional incriminating hearsay and circumstantial evidence supporting the witness statements made by O. and P.\n152: The Court observes that the applicant had the opportunity to give his own version of the events on 3 February 2007 – an opportunity of which he availed himself – and also to cast doubt on the credibility of the witnesses, whose identity had been known to him, by cross-examining the other witnesses giving hearsay evidence at his trial.\n153: The Court notes, however, that the applicant did not have the possibility of putting questions to O. and P. indirectly, for instance in writing. Moreover, neither the applicant himself nor his lawyer was given the opportunity at the investigation stage to question these witnesses.\n154: The Court observes in that context that the parties disagreed as to whether or not the refusal to appoint defence counsel for the applicant and to permit counsel to take part in the witnesses’ hearing before the investigating judge had complied with domestic law. The Court considers that it is not necessary for the purposes of the present proceedings for it to take a final stance on that question. It reiterates that in examining compliance with Article 6 of the Convention, it is not its function to determine whether the domestic courts acted in accordance with domestic law (compare Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, § 45, Series A no. 140; Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, § 94, ECHR 2006IX; and Heglas v. the Czech Republic, no. 5935/02, § 84, 1 March 2007), but to evaluate the overall fairness of the trial in the particular circumstances of the case, including the way in which the evidence was obtained (see paragraph 101 above).\n155: The Court considers that in the present case it is sufficient for it to note that, under the provisions of German law, the prosecution authorities could have appointed a lawyer for the applicant (Article 141 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, read in conjunction with Article 140 § 1). That lawyer would have had the right to be present at the witness hearing before the investigating judge and, as a rule, would have had to be notified thereof (Article 168c §§ 2 and 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). However, these procedural safeguards, which existed in the Code of Criminal Procedure and were reinforced by their interpretation by the Federal Court of Justice (see paragraphs 58-59 above), were not used in the applicant’s case.\n156: The Court would stress that, while Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention concerns the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses at the trial itself, the way in which the prosecution witnesses’ questioning at the investigation stage was conducted holds considerable importance for, and is likely to prejudice, the fairness of the trial itself where key witnesses cannot be heard by the trial court and the evidence obtained at the investigation stage is therefore introduced directly at the trial (see paragraph 104 above).\n157: In such circumstances, it is vital for the determination of the fairness of the trial as a whole to ascertain whether the authorities, at the time of the witness hearing at the investigation stage, proceeded on the assumption that the witness would not be heard at the trial. Where the investigating authorities took the reasonable view that the witness concerned would not be examined at the hearing of the trial court, it is essential for the defence to have been given an opportunity to put questions to the witness at the investigation stage (compare also Vronchenko, cited above, §§ 60 et seq., and Rosin, cited above, §§ 57 et seq., where the minor victims of a sexual offence were promised at the investigation stage that they would not be asked questions about the offence on any further occasions).\n158: The Court notes in this regard that the applicant challenged the Regional Court’s finding that the witnesses’ absence at the trial had not been foreseeable. It agrees with the applicant that the witnesses were heard by the investigating judge because, in view of the witnesses’ imminent return to Latvia, the prosecution authorities considered that there was a danger of their evidence being lost. This is shown by the reasoning of the prosecution’s own request to the investigating judge to hear O. and P. speedily in order to obtain a true statement which could be used at the subsequent trial (see paragraph 20 above). The Court observes in that context that, under Article 251 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the written records of a witness’s previous examination by an investigating judge may be read out at the trial under less strict conditions than the records of a witness examination by the police (Article 251 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; see paragraph 61 above).\n159: The Court observes that in the present case the authorities were aware that O. and P. had not pressed charges against the perpetrators immediately for fear of problems with the police and acts of revenge by the perpetrators, that they had been staying in Germany only temporarily while their families remained in Latvia and that they had explained that they wished to return to their home country as soon as possible. In these circumstances, the prosecution authorities’ assessment that it might not be possible to hear evidence from those witnesses at a subsequent trial against the applicant in Germany indeed appears convincing.\n160: Despite this, the prosecution authorities did not give the applicant an opportunity – which he could have been given under the provisions of domestic law – to have O. and P. questioned at the investigation stage by a lawyer appointed to represent him. By proceeding in that manner, they took the foreseeable risk, which subsequently materialised, that neither the accused nor his counsel would be able to question O. and P. at any stage of the proceedings (see, for the importance of counsel’s presence at the hearing of prosecution witnesses by the investigating judge, Hümmer, cited above, §§ 43 and 48).\n161: In assessing the overall fairness of the trial, the Court will have regard to the available counterbalancing factors, viewed in their entirety in the light of its finding to the effect that the evidence given by O. and P. was “decisive” for the applicant’s conviction (see paragraph 144 above).\n162: The Court observes that the trial court had before it some additional incriminating evidence regarding the offence of which the applicant was found guilty. However, the Court notes that hardly any procedural measures were taken to compensate for the lack of opportunity to directly cross-examine the witnesses at the trial. In the Court’s view, affording the defendant the opportunity to have a key prosecution witness questioned at least during the pre-trial stage and via his counsel constitutes an important procedural safeguard securing the accused’s defence rights, the absence of which weighs heavily in the balance in the examination of the overall fairness of the proceedings under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d).\n163: It is true that the trial court assessed the credibility of the absent witnesses and the reliability of their statements in a careful manner, thus attempting to compensate for the lack of cross-examination of the witnesses, and that the applicant had the opportunity to give his own version of the events in Göttingen. However, in view of the importance of the statements of the only eyewitnesses to the offence of which he was convicted, the counterbalancing measures taken were insufficient to permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of the untested evidence.\n164: The Court considers that, in these circumstances, the absence of an opportunity for the applicant to examine or have examined O. and P. at any stage of the proceedings rendered the trial as a whole unfair.\n165: Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.\n166: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n167: The applicant did not make any claims for just satisfaction in his observations dated 25 June 2013 in reply to the Government’s observations before the Chamber. He claimed 30,000 euros (EUR) in compensation and EUR 10,000 in costs and expenses, both in the application form and at the hearing before the Grand Chamber, without providing any further details or documentary proof.\n168: The Government did not comment on the question of just satisfaction in the proceedings before the Court.\n169: Under Rule 60 § 2 of the Rules of Court an applicant must submit itemised particulars of all claims, together with any relevant supporting documents, within the time-limit fixed for the submission of the applicant’s observations on the merits. If the applicant fails to comply with these requirements, the Court may reject the claim in whole or in part (Rules 60 § 3 and 71). In its letter dated 15 May 2013, the Court drew the applicant’s attention to the fact that these requirements applied even if he had indicated his wishes concerning just satisfaction at an earlier stage of the proceedings.\n170: The Court observes that the applicant failed to submit any just-satisfaction claims, together with any relevant supporting documents, within the time-limit fixed therefor in the proceedings before the Chamber. The applicant, who had been granted legal aid in the proceedings before the Court, likewise did not submit new quantified claims, together with the required supporting documents, in respect of additional costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the Grand Chamber. The Court, having regard to Rule 60, therefore makes no award under Article 41 of the Convention."

            "001-108072\n26: Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died, there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed. That was the case here. That public interest must not be allowed to override the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial. Like the court in Sellick [see paragraph 48 below] we do not consider that the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights requires the conclusion that in such circumstances the trial will be unfair. The provision in Article 6 § 3 (d) that a person charged shall be able to [have] the witnesses against him examined is one specific aspect of a fair trial: but if the opportunity is not provided, the question is ‘whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way the evidence was taken, were fair’ – Doorson, paragraph 19 [see paragraph 58 below]. This was not a case where the witness had absented himself, whether through fear or otherwise, or had required anonymity, or had exercised a right to keep silent. The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.”",
            "001-112280\n42: Furthermore, as concerns the fact that the Regional Court heard the investigating judge who gave an account of the witnesses’ pre-trial statements of 8 December 2003, the Court reiterates that the use in evidence of statements obtained at the investigative stage is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 3 (d) and 1 of Article 6, provided the defendant has been given an adequate opportunity to challenge the statements, either when made or at a later stage (see, among other authorities, Isgrò v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, § 34, Series A no. 194A; Lucà, cited above, § 40 and Gossa v. , no. 47986/99, § 54, 9 January 2007). This implies that the use made of evidence admitted by the trial court must comply with the rights of the defence, in particular, where the accused has not had an opportunity at any stage in the earlier proceedings to question the persons whose statements are introduced into the trial (see, mutatis mutandis, Unterpertinger, cited above, § 31) and where they form the sole or decisive evidence for a conviction or related decision by the trial court (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 119). The Court has held in this context that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may be restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (the so-called “sole or decisive rule”; ibid.).",
            "001-159566\n105: However, the use as evidence of statements obtained at the stage of a police inquiry and judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d), provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him – either when that witness is making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 118, with further references; see also A.G. v. Sweden (dec.), no. 315/09, 10 January 2012, and Trampevski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 4570/07, § 44, 10 July 2012).",
            "001-108072\n130: As to the first argument, the Court accepts that the sole or decisive rule may have been developed in the context of legal systems which permitted a defendant to be convicted on evidence of witnesses whom he did not have an opportunity to challenge, a situation which would not have arisen if the strict common-law rule against hearsay evidence had been applied. However, the Court notes that the present cases have arisen precisely because the legal system in England and Wales has abandoned the strict common-law rule against hearsay evidence. Exceptions to the rule have been created, notably in the 1988 and 2003 Acts, which allowed for the admission of S.T.’s statement in the Al-Khawaja case and T.’s statement in the Tahery case (see paragraphs 41 and 44 above). The Court recognises that these dilutions of the strict rule against hearsay have been accompanied by statutory safeguards and, accordingly, the central question in the present cases is whether the application of these safeguards was sufficient to secure the applicants’ rights under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). Against this background, while it is important for the Court to have regard to substantial differences in legal systems and procedures, including different approaches to the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials, ultimately it must apply the same standard of review under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d), irrespective of the legal system from which a case emanates.",
            "001-108072\n142: With respect to the Government’s final argument, the Court is of the view that the two reasons underpinning the sole or decisive rule that were set out in the Doorson judgment remain valid. For the first, the Court finds no reason to depart from its finding in Kostovski that inculpatory evidence against an accused may well be “designedly untruthful or simply erroneous”. Moreover, unsworn statements by witnesses who cannot be examined often appear on their face to be cogent and compelling and it is, as Lord Justice Sedley pointed out, “seductively easy” to conclude that there can be no answer to the case against the defendant (see paragraph 115 above). Experience shows that the reliability of evidence, including evidence which appears cogent and convincing, may look very different when subjected to a searching examination. The dangers inherent in allowing untested hearsay evidence to be adduced are all the greater if that evidence is the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant. As to the second reason, the defendant must not be placed in the position where he is effectively deprived of a real chance of defending himself by being unable to challenge the case against him. Trial proceedings must ensure that a defendant’s Article 6 rights are not unacceptably restricted and that he or she remains able to participate effectively in the proceedings (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, § 83, 16 December 1999, and Stanford v. the United Kingdom, 23 February 1994, § 26, Series A no. 282A). The Court’s assessment of whether a criminal trial has been fair cannot depend solely on whether the evidence against the accused appears prima facie to be reliable, if there are no means of challenging that evidence once it is admitted.",
            "001-59222\n26: In its judgment no. 254 of 1992, the Constitutional Court declared the second paragraph of Article 513 unconstitutional on the ground that, as the statements referred to therein could not be admitted in evidence at trial if the accused in connected proceedings remained silent, there was an unjustified difference in treatment between those statements and statements of the type referred to in the first paragraph. The  thereby enabled trial courts to admit statements made by a co-accused in connected proceedings, irrespective of whether the person against whom they were being used had been given the opportunity of examining the maker of the statement or of having him examined at any stage in the proceedings. Furthermore, the  made no reference to the procedural safeguards embodied in Article 6 of the Convention or to the criteria established by the Court’s case-law.",
            "001-108072\n147: The Court therefore concludes that, where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission as evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 § 1. At the same time, where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. Because of the dangers of the admission of such evidence, it would constitute a very important factor to balance in the scales, to use the words of Lord Mance in R. v. Davis (see paragraph 50 above), and one which would require sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance in the case.",
            "001-159566\n107: According to the principles developed in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, it is necessary to examine in three steps the compatibility with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention of proceedings in which statements made by a witness who had not been present and questioned at the trial were used as evidence (ibid., § 152). The Court must examine",
            "001-108072\n84: Section 8(1) of the Act provides that evidence must be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will (a) have an unfairly prejudicial effect on the proceeding; or (b) needlessly prolong the proceeding. Section 8(2) provides that in determining whether the probative value of evidence is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will have an unfairly prejudicial effect on a criminal proceeding, the judge must take into account the right of the defendant to offer an effective defence.",
            "001-108072\n124: The Court’s own case-law shows that it is more common for witnesses to have a general fear of testifying without that fear being directly attributable to threats made by the defendant or his agents. For instance, in many cases, the fear has been attributable to the notoriety of a defendant or his associates (see, for example, Dzelili v. Germany (dec.), no. 15065/05, 29 September 2009). There is, therefore, no requirement that a witness’s fear be attributable directly to threats made by the defendant in order for that witness to be excused from giving evidence at trial. Moreover, fear of death or injury of another person or of financial loss are all relevant considerations in determining whether a witness should not be required to give oral evidence. This does not mean, however, that any subjective fear of the witness will suffice. The trial court must conduct appropriate enquiries to determine, firstly, whether or not there are objective grounds for that fear, and, secondly, whether those objective grounds are supported by evidence (see, for example, Krasniki v. the , no. 51277/99, §§ 80-83, 28 February 2006, where the Court was not satisfied that the domestic courts had carried out an examination of the reasons for the witnesses’ fear before granting them anonymity)."

The Court adopted the consequence-based approach in Denisov v. Ukraine, a case concerning the dismissal of a judge from his position of president of a court, to find that the measure complained of did not have serious negative consequences for the aspects constituting the applicant’s “private life”, namely: (i) his “inner circle”; (ii) his opportunities to establish and develop relationships with others; or (iii) his reputation.

Acknowledging that such disputes are not per se excluded from the scope of “private life”, it determined the criteria for the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention in such situations. It thus established that generally speaking, there are two ways in which a private-life issue would usually arise in such a dispute: either because of the underlying reasons for the impugned measure (in that event the Court employs the reason-based approach) or because of the consequences for private life (in that event the Court employs the consequence-based approach) (ibid., § 115).\n\n001-186216\n102: In the cases falling into the above-mentioned category, the Court applies the concept of “private life” on the basis of two different approaches: (α) identification of the “private life” issue as the reason for the dispute (reason-based approach) and (β) deriving the “private life” issue from the consequences of the impugned measure (consequence-based approach).\n\n001-186216\n115: The Court concludes from the above case-law that employment-related disputes are not per se excluded from the scope of “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention.

These aspects include (i) the applicant’s “inner circle”, (ii) the applicant’s opportunity to establish and develop relationships with others, and (iii) the applicant’s social and professional reputation.

RUSSIA; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 30997/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by the Russian nationals, Mr Sergey Anatolyevich Polufakin and Mr Ivan Vladimirovich Chernyshev (“the applicants”), on 24 June 2002.\n2: The applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Ms O. Belyachkova, a lawyer practising in . The Russian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by Mr P. Laptev, the Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights, and subsequently by their Representative, Mrs V. Milinchuk.\n3: On 20 January 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n4: The Government objected to the joint examination of the admissibility and merits of the application. Having considered the Government’s objection, the Court dismissed it.\n5: The applicants were born in 1966 and 1977 respectively and live in Naberezhnye Chelny, Tatarstan. They are currently serving their respective sentences in correctional facility UE-148/5 in Sviyazhsk, Tatarstan.\n6: On 6 December 2000 Mr D.E., Mr Yu.D. and  were transporting a travel bag with a large sum of money belonging to their employer, Ms S.S., in a car owned by Mr V.G. At about midnight the car was stopped by four armed persons disguised as policemen. Two of them had portable radios. They robbed Mr D.E., Mr Yu.D. and  and beat them up before stealing the travel bag and some other items from the car and leaving.\n7: In the evening of 7 December 2000 the applicants were in Mr R.’s flat together with Mr Sh. At around 10 p.m. the police entered and searched the flat. They found a travel bag with money and two portable radios.\n8: At 11 p.m. on 7 December 2000 the applicants, Mr Sh. and Mr R. were arrested on suspicion of robbery. The arrest was ordered by a prosecutor. The report on the applicants’ arrest was drawn up at 4 p.m. on 8 December 2000.\n9: Following his arrest, the first applicant was searched in the absence of a lawyer. The police found a wallet in his pocket with a list of towns and traffic police posts located near the road where the crime had been committed.\n10: On 8 December 2000 the second applicant was questioned by investigators in the absence of a lawyer.\n11: On 9 December 2000 the investigator ordered the first applicant’s placement in custody as a measure of restraint. On an unspecified date the same measure was applied to the second applicant. Later, the respective terms of the applicants’ pre-trial detention were extended several times by the prosecutor.\n12: When asked where he had got the money found in Mr R.’s flat, the first applicant explained that he had borrowed it from an acquaintance of his, Mr L. The second applicant said that he had borrowed the money from three persons: his sister, Mr M.A. and Mr I.P.\n13: The investigator questioned Mr L. The printed version of Mr L.’s statement read “I did not give [the first applicant] any money”.\n14: The second applicant’s sister confirmed her brother’s account of events when questioned by the investigator. Mr M.A. and Mr I.P. were not questioned.\n15: The first applicant told the investigator that at about 1 a.m. on 7 December 2000 he had bought some food in a night shop “M.” and requested that sales assistants from the shop be questioned. On 5 May 2001 the request was refused.\n16: The first applicant further requested the investigators to question Mr Yu.I., an employee of a petrol station who had allegedly seen him on the night of the crime.\n17: On unspecified dates Mr D.E., Mr Yu.D., , Mr V.G. and Ms S.S. were granted victim status and were questioned by the investigator.\n18: The applicants did not participate in any identification parade before the victims and did not confront them.\n19: The first applicant told the investigators that the list of towns seized from him during the search had been put into his pocket by a police officer, Mr T. The investigator ordered a graphology examination of the document. The expert report stated that one set of handwriting was identical to that of the first applicant. The first applicant insisted that the expert report had not attributed the handwriting to him.\n20: Two other witnesses, Mr G. and Mr Tr., apparently police officers, were questioned by the investigator.\n21: While in pre-trial detention, the first applicant received a handwritten note allegedly containing threats. He believed that the note had been written by one of his co-accused, Mr Sh.\n22: Upon completion of the investigation the applicants were allowed to study the case file.\n23: On 5 July 2001 the prosecutor drew up a bill of indictment charging Mr R., Mr Sh. and the applicants with aggravated robbery with violence, destruction of property, illegal possession of arms, possession of drugs and theft of official documents. The case file was transmitted to the court.\n24: Following their arrest, the first and second applicants were questioned as suspects on 8 and 9 December 2000 respectively. Neither of them confessed to any crimes.\n25: On 14 December 2000 criminal charges were brought against the second applicant; on the same date he had been questioned as an accused in the presence of counsel, Mr V.T. The second applicant made no statements referring to his right to remain silent.\n26: On 14 or 15 December 2000 the first applicant was officially charged and questioned as an accused in the presence of officially assigned counsel, Mr O.P. The first applicant informed the investigators that he wanted to retain Mr M.; the latter was notified of the first applicant’s request.\n27: On 21 December 2000 the investigators questioned Mr Yu.I. He said that he could not remember which cars had been refuelled at the station on the night of 6 to 7 December 2000.\n28: At some point the second applicant informed the investigators that he wanted to retain Mr A. as counsel. Mr A was then notified of the request.\n29: On 23 March 2001 the applicants were visited by their relatives and asked them to retain Mr M. and Mr. A. as counsel.\n30: At some point the first applicant informed the investigators that, since Mr M. had not visited him, he wanted to retain Mr A. He rejected assistance offered by other lawyers. On 24 March 2001 the first applicant’s mother, Mr M. and Mr A. were notified of his intention. On an unspecified date the head of the Advocates Office informed the investigators that the first applicant had signed no contracts for legal representation with either Mr M. or Mr A. On 3 April 2001 the investigator dismissed the first applicant’s request to retain Mr M. and Mr A. on the ground that he had not registered their appointment with the Advocates Office.\n31: On 2 April 2001 both applicants were charged with another offence in the presence of Mr O.P., Mr V.T. and Mr A. They refused to make any statements and stated that they did not need the lawyers’ assistance. The applicants studied the case file separately from Mr P. and Mr V.T.\n32: On 5 May 2001 the investigator refused a request for additional questioning of Mr Yu.I.\n33: On 17 July 2001 the trial against the applicants and their two co-accused commenced in the Leninskiy District Court of the  (“the trial court”).\n34: According to the first applicant, on 17 July 2001 he challenged Mr O.P. as counsel because he had seen the lawyer’s last name appear as the name of a police officer in a search report drawn up in respect of one of the first applicant’s co-accused. On 24 July 2001 Mr O.P. was not present at the hearing.\n35: According to the Government, on an unspecified date the second applicant stated that he did not wish to have Mr V.T. as counsel and asked to retain Mr A. Between 18 October and 8 December 2001 he was represented by Mr V.T. The trial court asked the first applicant whether he wished to appoint another lawyer, , as his counsel; the first applicant submitted that he did not need any assistance from lawyers. On 19 September and 21 October 2001 the first applicant again submitted that he needed no lawyers; he did not allege that his decision to defend himself had been motivated by any financial difficulties.\n36: On 17 July 2001 the first applicant requested the trial court to summon Mr Yu.I. and the sales assistants from the night shop “M.” who could confirm his alibi. The trial court agreed to summon Mr Yu.I. but refused to summon the sales assistants because their personal particulars were unknown.\n37: On 17 July 2001 the trial court summoned the five victims to attend the hearing scheduled on 24 July 2001.\n38: By letter of 18 September 2001 the victims informed the trial court that they refused to attend the hearing. Mr D.E., Mr Yu.D., Mr V.G. and Ms S.S. explained that they did so in the interests of their own security and that of their families.  said that he could not be absent from work as there was no one to replace him. All the victims also confirmed their pre-trial depositions and requested them to be read out at the trial in their absence.\n39: On 24 September 2001 the trial court summoned the five victims of the crime to attend the hearing scheduled on 8 October 2001.\n40: On 5 October 2001 Mr D.E., Mr Yu.D., , Mr V.G. and Ms S.S. sent the trial court a letter identical to that of 18 September 2001.\n41: On 26 October 2001 the trial court asked the parties if they had any objections to the reading out of the victims’ pre-trial statements. The defence objected, while the prosecution proposed to grant the victims’ request. The trial court found that the victims had not appeared at the hearing for a valid reason; that measures to ensure their attendance had been repeatedly taken; and that the victims had notified the trial court of their absence in advance. The victims’ pre-trial statements were read out.\n42: On 11 October 2001 the first applicant requested the trial court to summon Mr L. in order to clarify one point in his statement. The record of Mr L.’s pre-trial statement had been visibly corrected in pencil to the effect that the printed words “I did not give him any money” were replaced by “I have already given him the money”, which reversed the sense of the statement. The trial court granted the request. Mr L. failed to attend the hearing. According to the applicants, the trial court noted that the latter had been busy at work and asked each co-accused and their lawyers whether there were any objections to the reading out of Mr L.’s pre-trial statement.

The printed wording of Mr L.’s statement and the statements by Mr Yu.I and Mr K. were read out.\n46: The trial court questioned the investigator who had dealt with the applicants’ case. He said that he had heard Mr L. saying that he had not given any money to the first applicant.\n47: The first applicant requested to summon Mr T., the police officer who had allegedly put the seized list of towns in his pocket. The court refused the request on the ground that Mr T. was on a business trip. Later, Mr T. appeared before the court and stated that an unidentified police officer had found the list of towns in the first applicant’s pocket.\n48: Mr R. testified against the second applicant in court in respect of the charge of illegal possession of arms.\n49: The second applicant requested to summon Mr I.P., who had allegedly lent him part of the money that the police had found in Mr R.’s flat. According to the second applicant, the court refused to do so because Mr I.P. had left Chuvashiya; the second applicant submitted that the investigators and the court had been aware of Mr I.P.’s whereabouts. The Government submitted that the court had summoned Mr I.P. but he had failed to appear at the hearing.\n50: The trial court granted a request by the second applicant to summon another defence witness, Mr M.A. The latter did not attend the hearing.\n51: On an unspecified date the court dismissed the first applicant’s request to summon the sales assistants who could allegedly confirm his alibi on the ground that they could not remember the first applicant because almost a year had elapsed between December 2000 and October 2001.\n52: The second applicant requested to summon officers of the traffic police squad who had been on duty at the police post near the crime scene on 6 December 2000. He submitted that the squad should have registered all cars passing by the police post and the fact that his car had not been seen by the police could have confirmed his alibi. On an unspecified date the court dismissed the request on the ground that the policemen could not remember all the cars they had seen that night.\n53: The court read out the pre-trial statement by the second applicant’s sister confirming that she had given her brother the money.\n54: The statements of two prosecution witnesses, Mr G. and Mr Tr., were not read out at the hearing; the trial court did not take them into consideration.\n55: On 18 October 2001 the first applicant requested the trial court to declare the record of his pre-trial questioning inadmissible evidence on the ground that he had been questioned in the absence of a lawyer. He alleged that he had made a self-incriminating statement under police pressure. According to the first applicant, the trial court delivered no ruling in this respect and read out the pre-trial statement.\n56: The second applicant testified at the trial. As his testimony differed from his pre-trial statement, the court decided to read out the latter.\n57: The first applicant challenged the stipendiary judge and the lay judges. He submitted that the bill of indictment had been based on inadmissible evidence. On 11 October 2001 the trial court dismissed the challenge as unsubstantiated.\n58: Requests by the first applicant to order an additional graphology examination of the list of towns seized from him and a graphology examination of the threatening note presumably written by Mr Sh. were dismissed.\n59: Both applicants challenged the court’s secretary, claiming that she had erred when drafting the record of the trial. The challenge was dismissed on 29 October 2001 as unsubstantiated.\n60: The trial court dismissed a request by the applicants to organise a reconstruction of the events.\n61: Certain items of physical evidence collected by the investigation were not presented at the trial.

The request was dismissed.\n62: On 8 November 2001 the trial court found the first applicant guilty of robbery with violence and the second applicant of robbery with violence and illegal possession of firearms and sentenced each of them to nine years’ imprisonment. The applicants were acquitted of the other charges.\n63: The trial court found that the applicants’ guilt was confirmed by the statements of all the victims, the prosecution witnesses – that is, the investigator, Mr T., Mr K. and Mr L. – and in particular by the statement of Mr L. that he had not given any money to the first applicant, and other items of evidence, including the list of towns seized from the first applicant and two portable radios belonging to the applicants. The trial court further found that no credit could be given to the statement of the second applicant’s sister because she had only been trying to help her brother.\n64: When enumerating the pieces of evidence in the judgment, the trial court summarised the second applicant’s pre-trial statement as follows: “[the second applicant] had 100,000 roubles’ worth of money. They had no portable radio transmitters. Mr Polufakin and [the second applicant] each kept the money in their plastic bags.” It did not expressly rely on that statement to prove the second applicant’s guilt.\n65: On 17 November 2001 the second applicant sent his comments on the record of the trial to the trial court. He noted, in particular, that it was recorded on page 71 that there had been no objections to reading out the witnesses’ pre-trial statements despite the fact that he had objected and had requested that the witnesses’ reasons for their absence be stated.\n66: On 21 November 2001 the trial court agreed to amend the record of trial in accordance with some of the second applicant’s comments. Numerous comments, including the one concerning page 71, were rejected.\n67: The applicants appealed to the Supreme Court of the  (“the appeal court”) against the first-instance judgment on the grounds, inter alia, that the victims and the prosecution witnesses had not been questioned at the trial and that certain points of the victims’ and witnesses’ pre-trial statements had not been clarified. They further alleged that the trial court had relied on inadmissible evidence and that the expert examination report of the physical evidence had been expressed with a certain degree of probability. The first applicant complained about the trial court’s refusal to conduct an additional graphology examination of the list of towns but did not expressly raise an issue of inadmissibility as evidence with regard to this item.\n68: The second applicant’s lawyer, Mr A.T., was absent at the appeal hearing. According to the second applicant, his request to adjourn the hearing due to the lawyer’s absence was dismissed by the court. According to the Government, Mr A.T. was duly informed of the date of the appeal hearing but failed to attend it. The second applicant did not request to postpone the hearing due to his lawyer’s absence. The appeal court studied Mr A.T.’s points of appeal. The first applicant defended himself before the appeal court.\n69: On 8 January 2002 the appeal court upheld the judgment of 8 November 2001. It stated, inter alia, that the applicants’ guilt had been proven by the victims’ pre-trial statements and other evidence, and that the guilt of the first applicant had also been proven by the list of towns found in his wallet. The appeal court further noted that the trial court had taken measures to secure the victims’ and witnesses’ presence and that their statements had been read out in accordance with domestic law.\n70: The trial court dismissed requests by the applicants for access to the case file on 15 and 21 November 2001.\n71: Requests by the applicants for supervisory review were dismissed by the Supreme Court of the  on 3 and 14 March 2003 and by the Supreme Court of Russia on 14 November 2003 and 15 March 2004.\n72: The applicants also complained to the Ombudsman of the , but to no avail.\n73: Between 8 and 18 December 2000 the applicants were kept in the temporary detention centre of .

As there was not enough space, the convoying officers used force when placing the detainees in the compartments.\n89: The conditions of transportation were extremely poor: the first applicant and other detainees were underfed during the journey; before leaving remand prison IZ-66/1, Ekaterinburg, the first applicant had received three loaves of bread from the authorities and was not given any other food for the next three days of transportation by rail.\n90: At various railway stations detainees were escorted by different groups of convoying officers. When loading detainees onto trains at railway stations, members of each convoying group used similar practices. In particular, once at a railway station detainees were forced to squat with their heads down. Then the convoying officers ordered them to rise, with their heads still down, and to run forward in the direction of their carriages. Detainees carried their heavy bags in their outstretched arms.

The first applicant complained to the court of unlawful actions by an official. His complaint was dismissed by a final decision of 18 December 2003.\n102: In March 2006 the first applicant learned that on 10 June 2002 he had been diagnosed with hepatitis C.\n103: In his observations of 10 November 2006 the first applicant submitted that 1,700 detainees had been in UE-148/5 at that time.\n104: Detainees kept in UE-148/5, the strict-regime correctional facility, lived in residence halls. They could stay inside the halls during certain hours and spent the rest of their time in other premises, such as production units.\n105: On 9 June 2002 the first applicant was allocated an individual sleeping place in the residential hall of brigade no. 7.

His cell measured 90 sq.m and accommodated forty inmates. Each inmate was allocated 2.25 sq.m of space.\n109: The sanitary facilities of the three residence halls were properly equipped as required by domestic law. In particular, the residence hall of brigade no. 8 comprised three dormitories, with 130 beds in total. It was equipped with a washroom measuring 25 sq.m, in which there were five showers, a mirror, a shelf, a urinal and a foot bath.\n110: There was a properly equipped bath house in UE-148/5 where detainees could wash once a week in accordance with a schedule.\n111: There were five wash basins with cold and hot water taps in every residence hall.

The first applicant showed no clinical signs of hepatitis.\n116: The second applicant suffered from chronic hepatitis B and C. According to the medical certificate issued by the Town Outpatient Polyclinic of Naberezhnye Chelny on 24 April 2003, the second applicant needed a specific diet, vitamins and hepatoprotective medicines. He was also recommended constant medical supervision.\n117: On 13 October 2003 the second applicant received two NO-SPA tablets in the UE-148/2 infirmary.\n118: On 15 January 2006 the second applicant was transferred to the prison hospital of the FSIN of Tatarstan. While being transported by rail he lost consciousness. The convoying officers had no medicines to help him to recover his senses. On the same date he was admitted to the prison hospital.\n119: Between 15 January and 14 February 2006 the second applicant was kept in ward no. 2 of the prison hospital. The ward had only one small window measuring 20 x 20 cm and lacked fresh air and natural light. During that period the second applicant was treated with a glucose solution and Carsil, a hepatoptotective medicine.\n120: While in the hospital, the second applicant complained in writing to a district prosecutor’s office of a lack of medicines and qualified medical assistance in the prison hospital.\n121: On 15 February 2006 the second applicant was transferred to ward no. 4, which had bigger windows. He learned that his inmates were HIV-positive.\n122: The second applicant was treated with medicines which his brother had bought on the doctors’ recommendation, including hepatoprotective medications Heptral and Essenciale. He was losing weight despite keeping to the prescribed diet.\n123: By letter of 24 August 2006 the doctor of the prison hospital informed the second applicant’s lawyer that some medicines administered to the second applicant had been purchased by his relatives. She also said that it could not be established whether the second applicant needed anti-viral therapy as he had been discharged from the prison hospital and noted, further, that such therapy was to be administered only after a complex examination that could not be carried out in penitentiary institutions.\n124: In 1995 the second applicant was registered at the Outpatient Polyclinic no. 4 of Naberezhnye Chelny, Tatarstan, as suffering from chronic viral hepatitis B and C with a high degree of replication activity.\n125: While in detention, the second applicant regularly underwent medical check-ups and chest X-rays that revealed no clinical evidence of tuberculosis.

In particular, he submitted that the facilities in which he had been detained had been overcrowded. He also alleged that during the transportation he had been ill-treated by the convoying officers. The first applicant further vaguely complained that in UE-148/5 inmates had run the risk of infection with tuberculosis and hepatitis, that the infirmary had not had certain medicines and that the catering had been poor. Article 3 reads as follows:\n132: The Government contested the first applicant’s allegations. They noted that the first applicant had not brought his grievances to the attention of the prosecutors or courts. Therefore, in the Government’s view, his complaints under Article 3 of the Convention should be dismissed for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies pursuant to Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.\n133: Further, they insisted that the conditions of his pre-trial detention and transportation had been compatible with Article 3 of the Convention. As to the conditions of the detention in UE-148/5, the Government submitted that in a correctional facility inmates were kept not in cells, but in residence halls. They could stay in their dormitories in the residence hall at night and spent the day in other premises of the correctional facility. The statutory occupancy rate of 2 sq. m of space per person had been complied with in UE-148/5. Due to the lack of clinical evidence of hepatitis, there was no causal link between the first applicant’s detention in the Russian penitentiaries and his illness. Furthermore, the applicant himself admitted that he had suffered from hepatitis C in 1998. The Government submitted that, according to the Rules on Internal Order in the Penitentiary, the copying of case materials was a service payable by a detainee. The first applicant had made no complaints to the UE-148/5 administration or other supervising bodies about a lack of access to his case file.\n134: In support of their submissions the Government produced photographs of the dormitories of UE-148/5. The date on which the photographs had been taken was not communicated.\n135: The Government submitted that on 22 March 2006 the first applicant had confirmed in writing that the situation in the penitentiary system had improved in comparison with that of 2001–2002 and that “at present conditions of detention are compatible with the law, I have no claims as regards the facts mentioned in the complaint”. On 22 March 2006 the first applicant had stated in writing that he had no complaints about the UE-148/5 infirmary.\n136: In sum, the Government asserted that there had been no breach of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the first applicant.\n137: The first applicant reiterated his complaints. He submitted that no effective remedies existed in relation to his complaint concerning the conditions of transportation. He emphasised that UE-148/5 had been overcrowded and that the number of showers in the bath-house had been insufficient given the number of detainees.\n138: In support of his submission, the first applicant produced two written statements by his fellow inmates, Mr O.K. and Mr I.S. According to Mr O.K., who had been detained in UE-148/5 since February 2000, in 2002–2003 fifty-three inmates had been kept in a cell measuring 35 sq.m, and three inmates had contracted tuberculosis. According to Mr I.S., who had been detained in UE-148/5 since 1999, in June 2002 the applicants had been placed in section no. 1 of the residence hall of brigade no. 7. At that time more than five hundred detainees had been in that residence hall. Due to lack of beds, inmates had slept in shifts, but some of them had had to sleep on the floor or on stools. For a month the first applicant had slept on the floor; then he had slept in a bed in shifts with the second applicant.\n139: The Court reiterates that it is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 76, ECHR 1999-V, and Mifsud v. France (dec.), no. 57220/00, § 15, ECHR 2002-VIII). The Court further reiterates that the domestic remedies must be “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 158, ECHR-XI).\n140: The Court notes at the outset that the first applicant did not complain to any domestic authorities that he had been ill-treated in any manner by the convoying officers. Accordingly, the Government’s objection in this respect must be supported. It follows that the part of the first applicant’s complaint concerning the alleged ill-treatment by the convoying officers must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies pursuant to Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.\n141: The Court further points out that it has already established that no effective domestic remedy existed in the Russian legal system in relation to complaints concerning the general conditions of detention in remand prisons, in particular with regard to the structural problem of overcrowding (see Benediktov v. , no. 106/02, § 29, 10 May 2007).\n142: The Court also notes the Government’s submission that the first applicant had not complained to prosecutors of poor conditions of his transportation by rail. However, it finds that the Government have not shown that a complaint to a prosecutor could offer preventive or compensatory redress for conditions of transportation that are contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. Neither have they proved that a complaint to a court could have promptly improved the first applicant’s situation.\n143: Lastly, the Government submitted that the first applicant had not lodged any complaints concerning the conditions of his detention in correctional facility UE-148/5 before the prosecutors or courts. However, they did not specify what type of claim or complaint would have been an effective remedy in their view and did not provide any further information as to how this could have prevented the alleged violation or its continuation or provided the first applicant with adequate redress. In the absence of such evidence and having regard to the above-mentioned principles, the Court finds that the Government have not substantiated their claim that the remedies that the first applicant had allegedly failed to exhaust in relation to his complaints concerning the conditions of transportation by rail and the conditions of his detention in the correctional facility were effective (see, among other authorities, Kranz v. Poland, no. 6214/02, § 23, 17 February 2004, and Skawinska v. Poland (dec.), no. 42096/98, 4 March 2003).\n144: Accordingly, the Court accepts the Government’s objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of the first applicant’s complaint of alleged ill-treatment by the convoying officers and dismisses their objections in respect of the complaints concerning conditions of the first applicant’s detention in the remand prisons and correctional facility UE-148/5, as well as the conditions of his transportation.\n145: The Court reiterates that Article 35 § 1 of the Convention requires that the Court may only deal with a matter where it has been introduced within six months from the date of the final decision. Where it is clear from the outset however that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on, or prejudice to, the applicant (see Dennis and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76573/01, 2 July 2002).\n146: The Court observes that the first applicant raised his complaint concerning the conditions of detention for the first time in his letter to the Court of 5 February 2003. As regards the complaints about the temporary detention centre and remand prison of Cheboksary, the first applicant’s detention in these facilities ended on 18 December 2000 and 24 January 2002 respectively, which is more than six months prior to the date of introduction of the complaint (see, for example, Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004).\n147: As to the complaints concerning the conditions of transportation and detention in the remand prisons during the period of transportation, the Court notes that the first applicant’s transportation by rail ended on 4 June 2002. It follows that these complaints were introduced out of time and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n148: The Court considers that it has competence to examine the first applicant’s complaint concerning the conditions of his detention in correctional facility UE-148/5 as from 4 June 2002. It finds that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n149: The Court reiterates that Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic society. It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim’s behaviour (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV). However, in order to fall under Article 3, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, § 162). The Court observes that, according to its constant case-law, measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve an inevitable element of suffering or humiliation. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on the State to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Valašinas v. Lithuania, no. 44558/98, §§ 101-02, ECHR 2001-VIII).\n150: Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that the parties have disputed certain aspects of the conditions of the first applicant’s detention in UE-148/5. The main characteristic of the detention conditions, upon which the parties disagreed, was the number of inmates kept in the cells. It follows from the information submitted by the first applicant that his dormitory was overcrowded to the extent that he had no individual sleeping place during, at the very least, the first two months of his detention in the correctional facility. The Government disputed that assertion. They submitted that between 9 June 2002 and 7 April 2003 the first applicant shared a cell with forty-four inmates and was allocated 2.04 sq.m. of personal space.\n151: In this connection the Court observes that Convention proceedings, as with the present application, do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation) because in certain instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or disproving such allegations. Failure on a Government’s part to submit such information without a satisfactory explanation may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant’s allegations (see Ahmet Özkan and Others v. Turkey, no. 21689/93, § 426, 6 April 2004).\n152: It was open to the Government to provide the Court with copies of registration logs showing names of inmates detained with the first applicant, which they failed to do. The Government did not assert that the photographs of the dormitories submitted to the Court (see paragraph 134 above) had been taken at the relevant time in 2002. In such circumstances the Court does not consider that the photographs can be regarded as refuting the first applicant’s allegations. The first applicant, in his turn, provided two written statements by his inmates as corroborating evidence to his submissions. Given that the Government did not offer any convincing explanation for their failure to provide relevant information, the Court will examine the issue concerning the number of inmates in the cells on the basis of the first applicant’s submissions.\n153: The first applicant argued that the correctional facility designed for 1,000 detainees had accommodated in fact in different time-periods as many as 1,700 or 2,300 inmates (see paragraphs 98 and 103 above). Such a degree of overpopulation had adversely affected the detainees’ quality of life; for instance, the bath-house’s capacity had not been adapted to the higher number of inmates.\n154: The Court reiterates that it has frequently found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in a number of cases against Russia on account of a lack of personal space afforded to detainees while in the pre-trial detention (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, § 104 et seq., ECHR 2005-X (extracts); Labzov v. Russia, no. 62208/00, § 44 et seq., 16 June 2005; Novoselov v. Russia, no. 66460/01, § 41 et seq., 2 June 2005; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 39 et seq., 20 January 2005; and Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, §§ 97 et seq., ECHR 2002-VI). It has also established that the problems arising from the conditions of the detention in Russian remand prisons were of a structural nature (see Mamedova v. , no. 7064/05, § 57, 1 June 2006; and Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004).\n155: A distinction must be drawn between the above mentioned cases concerning conditions of detention in remand prisons and the present application as the Court has not yet found that conditions of detention in correctional facilities could disclose a structural problem from the standpoint of Article 3 of the Convention (see, a contrario, Benediktov v. , no. 106/02, § 29, 10 May 2007). For example, it has declared manifestly ill-founded a complaint concerning conditions of detention in a correctional facility because the applicant enjoyed the wide freedom of movement in the facility’s premises. However, in that case the applicant was allocated 3.5 sq. m. of personal space and did not allege that he had no individual bed (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). Another complaint of conditions of detention in a correctional facility was dismissed as manifestly ill-founded because the applicant was at all times provided with an individual bunk bed (see Solovyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 76114/01, 27 September 2007).\n156: Leaving aside whether a structural problem of overpopulation exists in Russian correctional facilities, the Court considers nevertheless that the first applicant’s individual situation during the first months of his detention in UE-148/5 was deplorable.\n157: The Court takes note of the first applicant’s letter of 22 March 2006 submitted by the Government (see paragraph 135 above). It readily accepts that the conditions of detention in UE-148/5 had been improved by 2006. Nonetheless, such an improvement in itself does not suffice to justify the poor conditions of the first applicant’s detention in 2002.\n158: Having regard to the aforesaid, the Court finds that the prolonged lack of the minimum comfort, which a normal night-time sleep in satisfactory conditions gives, combined with the deficiency of private space was sufficient to cause the first applicant’s distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention. Accordingly, the conditions of his detention amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment.\n159: It follows that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the lack of an individual sleeping place allocated to the first applicant in correctional facility UE-148/5 in 2002. In view of this finding the Court sees no need to decide separately on the issue of the alleged breach of the Convention on account of other alleged deficiencies of conditions of detention in that facility in respect of the first applicant.\n160: The second applicant complained in substance under Article 3 of the Convention about a lack of adequate medical treatment in UE-148/5 for his hepatitis.\n161: The Government submitted that the second applicant’s allegations were unsubstantiated. UE-148/5 had been fully supplied with the necessary medicines. While there, the second applicant had been under constant medical supervision. In sum, the Government claimed that the second applicant had received adequate medical assistance and thus his complaint was manifestly ill-founded. They further pleaded non-exhaustion on the ground that the second applicant had not complained of a lack of medical assistance to a prosecutor’s office or a court.\n162: The second applicant reiterated his complaint.\n163: The Court refers once again to the principles established in its case-law regarding the exhaustion of domestic remedies (see paragraph 139 above).\n164: The Court observes that the Government merely noted that the second applicant had not lodged any complaints concerning the medical assistance available to him while in detention before domestic courts or prosecutors. They neither specified what type of claim or complaint would have been an effective remedy in their view, nor provided any further information as to how they could have prevented the alleged violation or its continuation or provided the second applicant with the adequate redress. In such circumstances, and having regard to the above-mentioned principles, the Court finds that, although the Government raised the plea of non-exhaustion, they did not substantiate their claim that the remedies the second applicant had allegedly failed to exhaust were effective (see, among other authorities, Kranz v. Poland, no. 6214/02, § 23, 17 February 2004, and Skawinska v. Poland (dec.), no. 42096/98, 4 March 2003).\n165: For the above reasons, the Court finds that this part of the complaint cannot be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.\n166: Referring to the aforesaid general principles related to the prohibition of ill-treatment (see paragraph 149 above), the Court further reiterates that, although Article 3 cannot be interpreted as laying down a general obligation to release a detainee on health grounds safe for exceptional cases (see Papon v. France (no. 1) (dec.), no. 64666/01, ECHR 2001-VI, and Priebke v. Italy (dec.), no. 48799/99, 5 April 2001), the lack of appropriate medical treatment in prison may in itself raise an issue under Article 3, even if the applicant’s state of health does not require his immediate release. The State must ensure that given the practical demands of imprisonment, the health and well-being of a detainee are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical assistance (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, §§ 93-94, ECHR 2000-XI; see also Hurtado v. Switzerland, judgment of 28 January 1994, Series A no. 280-A, opinion of the Commission, pp. 15-16, § 79).\n167: Turning to the second applicant’s complaint concerning a lack of necessary medicines in the UE-148/5 infirmary and in the prison hospital, the Court reiterates that unavailability of necessary medicines may raise an issue under Article 3 if it has negative effects on the applicant’s state of health or causes suffering of a certain intensity (see Mirilashvili v. Russia (dec.) no. 6293/04, 10 July 2007).\n168: The Court points out that the second applicant received a certain range of treatment. In particular, he was administered hepatoprotective medicines which his brother had procured for him. Accordingly, the second applicant cannot claim to have been affected by the shortage of medicines in the hospital.\n169: The Court further notes that, while the second applicant disputed the adequacy of his treatment as a whole, he did not provide a medical opinion confirming his point of view. The Court considers that it does not follow from the letter of the prison hospital doctor that the second applicant’s state of health necessitated any specific treatment (see paragraph 123 above). The mere fact that a complex examination could not be carried out in the penitentiary institutions cannot be regarded as proof of an overall deficiency in the medical assistance available to the second applicant as it has not been shown that such an examination was indispensable in his particular situation. In the circumstances of the present case the Court considers that the second applicant’s state of health was not adversely affected by lack of certain medicines in the prison infirmary to the extent to cause him suffering.\n170: Having examined all the materials in its possession, the Court finds no basis on which to conclude that the medical assistance provided to the second applicant for his hepatitis while he was serving his sentence was inadequate.\n171: It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n172: In his observations of 10 November 2006 the second applicant vaguely complained for the first time that the convoying officers had not provided him with adequate medical assistance when he had lost consciousness on 15 January 2006, that the material conditions of his detention in ward no. 2 of the prison hospital had been poor and that he had shared ward no. 4 of that hospital with HIV-positive inmates. He relied on Article 3 of the Convention.\n173: The Government did not comment on the second applicant’s allegations.\n174: As to the second applicant’s complaints concerning the conditions of his detention in the prison hospital, the Court observes that he was kept in ward no. 2 of that hospital between 15 January and 14 February 2006. On 15 February 2006 the second applicant was transferred to ward no. 4. According to the Government, the second applicant was discharged from the prison hospital on 29 March 2006. The Court considers that the conditions of detention in the same ward are to be regarded as a continuing situation and reiterates that in such a case the six-month period runs from the cessation of the situation (see Novinskiy v. Russia, cited above, and B. and D. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9303/81, Commission decision of 13 October 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 49, p. 44). It notes that the second applicant’s detention in wards nos. 2 and 4 ended on 14 February and 29 March 2006 respectively. Therefore, the six-month time-period in relation to the complaints concerning the conditions of detention in those wards started running on the above dates. The Court points out that the second applicant complained of his detention in the prison hospital for the first time in his observations of 10 November 2006, having failed to comply with the six-month rule.\n175: Turning to the complaint of ineffective medical assistance administered to the second applicant by the convoying officers on 15 January 2006, the Court observes that such an incident, due to its instantaneous character, could not give rise to a continuing situation of a violation of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Bernadotte v. Sweden (dec.), no. 69688/01, 3 June 2004). The Court notes that it does not transpire from the materials at its disposal that the second applicant complained about that particular incident to the domestic authorities. Assuming that there were no effective remedies available, the Court considers that the six-month period started running on 15 January 2006, while the complaint was raised only on 10 November 2006, that is, more than six months later.\n176: The Court finds therefore that this part of the second applicant’s complaint is time-barred and must be dismissed pursuant to Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.\n177: The applicants complained under Article 6 § 1 that their right to a fair trial had been infringed because self-incriminating statements made in their lawyer’s absence had been used against them at the trial. They further complained, under Article 6 § 3 (d), that they could not cross-examine the prosecution or defence witnesses at the trial.\n178: Article 6 of the Convention, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n179: The Government contested the applicants’ allegations and submitted that on 8 and 9 December 2000 the applicants had been questioned as suspects and had denied their guilt. They had made no self-incriminating statements.\n180: They further submitted that hearings in the applicants’ criminal case had been repeatedly postponed due to the absence of the five victims. The trial court had taken all requisite measures to ensure the victims’ attendance. The victims, who had resided in Naberezhnye Chelny, Tatarstan, had refused to appear in the courtroom in Cheboksary, the , as they had feared for their safety. Despite the defence’s objections, the trial court had excused the victims’ absence and read out their pre-trial statements.\n181: The trial court had summoned Mr K., who had failed to appear at the hearing. His pre-trial statement had been read out at Mr Sh.’s request. Mr L. and Mr Yu.I. had been summoned to the hearing but failed to attend it. Their pre-trial statements had been read out as the defence had made no objections.\n182: The applicants’ request to summon employees of the shop and the police officers had been dismissed because the trial court had had no information about those persons or their whereabouts. Moreover, the court had noted that in October 2001 those persons could hardly have remembered the events of 6 December 2000. Mr P. and Mr M.A. had been summoned to the hearing at the second applicant’s request, but failed to attend it. The applicants had complained about the absence of the above-mentioned witnesses in court in their respective appeals. The appeal court had found that the applicants’ guilt had been proven by other evidence and emphasised that the trial court had taken all requisite measures to ensure the victims’ and witnesses’ presence at the hearings.\n183: In sum, the Government submitted that the applicants’ requests to summon defence witnesses had been granted on the same conditions as the requests to summon the prosecution witnesses and thus the requirements of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention were met.\n184: The applicants contested the Government’s arguments. In particular, they submitted that the second applicant’s testimony had been read out at the trial. They further insisted that the defence had objected to the reading out of the statements of Mr K. and Mr L. The applicants provided affidavits by Mr P. and Mr M.A. confirming that the two witnesses had never received summonses to attend the trial hearing.\n185: The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n186: The Court observes that nothing in the materials at its disposal indicates that the first applicant had made any self-incriminating statement that was later used against him. It is not persuaded that the second applicant’s pre-trial statement referred to in the judgment of 8 November 2001 (see paragraph 64 above) contributed in any manner to the establishment of his guilt.\n187: It follows that there has been no violation of Article 6 of the Convention in this respect.\n188: As the guarantees of paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Court will consider the complaint concerning the failure to examine prosecution and defence witnesses at the trial hearing under the two provisions taken together (see Asch v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1991, Series A no. 203, p. 10, § 25).\n189: The Court reiterates at the outset that the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and that as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court’s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling on whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II, § 67, and Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, § 50).\n190: All the evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument. There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence. As a general rule, the accused must be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statement or at a later stage (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 51, and Lüdi v. Switzerland, judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, § 49).\n191: In appropriate cases the principles of fair trial require that the interests of the defence are balanced against those of witnesses or victims called upon to testify, in particular where life, liberty or security of person are at stake, or interests coming generally within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention (see Doorson v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 70).\n192: However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6. Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (ibid., § 72, and P.S. v. , no. 33900/96, § 23, 20 December 2001).\n193: Where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 55, and Windisch v. Austria, judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 186, § 31).\n194: The Court notes that the applicants’ conviction for robbery with violence was based, inter alia, on statements given by Mr D.E., Mr Yu.D., , Mr V.G. and Ms S.S. during the preliminary investigation. It considers that, although the five victims of the crime did not testify in court in person, they are to be regarded for the purposes of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention as witnesses – a term to be given an autonomous interpretation – since their pre-trial statements were taken into account by the trial court (see Delta v. France, judgment of 19 December 1990, Series A no. 191A, § 33).\n195: The Court notes that organising criminal proceedings in such a way as to protect the interests of victims is a relevant consideration to be taken into account for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. However, the reasons given by the victims to justify their absence at the trial were rather vague and speculative and do not, therefore, appear relevant. In particular, Mr D.E., Mr Yu.D., Mr V.G. and Ms S.S. twice refused to attend the trial hearing because they feared for their safety. They failed to provide any explanation as to the nature of or grounds for those fears. Furthermore,  excused himself from the trial simply on grounds of his inability to be absent from work.\n196: The Court cannot establish from the materials at its disposal how the trial court assessed the reasonableness of the personal fear of the victims vis-à-vis the applicants or counterbalanced Mr R.I.’s need to be at work against the applicants’ defence rights. Accordingly, it is bound to conclude that the trial court took the reasons advanced by the victims for granted without considering whether they were genuine or not.\n197: Having regard to the fact that the applicants had no opportunity to cross-examine the five victims of the crime at the pre-trial stage, the Court is not satisfied that the interest of the victims in ensuring their safety or securing their employment could justify limiting the rights of the applicants to a considerable extent (see, mutatis mutandis, Krasniki v. the , no. 51277/99, § 83, 28 February 2006).\n198: In these circumstances, the applicants cannot be said to have received a fair trial.\n199: There has thus been a violation of Article 6 § 3 (d) in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of both applicants on account of the victims’ absence at the trial.\n200: The Court notes that Mr L. was a prosecution witness from whom the first applicant had allegedly borrowed the money found by the police (see paragraphs 12, 13 and 42 above) and that Mr K. was a prosecution witness who had seen two men in the flat in which the applicants had been arrested (see paragraph 44 above). It further notes that it was disputed between the parties whether the defence had objected to Mr L.’s pre-trial statements being read out at the hearing of 26 October 2001. If the first applicant had indeed failed to raise an objection, such a failure could be considered as a waiver of the right (see Vozhigov v. , no. 5953/02, § 57, 26 April 2007). The Court reiterates that a waiver of the exercise of a right guaranteed by the Convention, in so far as such a waiver is permitted in domestic law, must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance (see Colozza v. Italy, judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, pp. 14-15, § 28; Sejdovic v.  [GC], no. 56581/00, § 86, ECHR 2006...; and Hermi v.  [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006...).\n201: The Court notes that the first applicant requested that Mr L. be summoned to the hearing (see paragraph 42 above). The Government did not dispute the applicants’ submissions that they had objected to the statements of the two witnesses being read out at the hearings held before 26 October 2001. The second applicant challenged the accuracy of the trial record that contained a note “No objections” at page 71, arguing that the court secretary had erred in failing to insert the objections to the witnesses’ statements being read out (see paragraph 65 above). In such circumstances the Court finds that there was no unequivocal waiver of the first applicant’s right to question Mr L.\n202: Furthermore, the Court is not persuaded that the applicants did not object to Mr K.’s pre-trial statement being read out (see paragraph 45 above). It refers in this connection to the Government’s submission that Mr Sh., the applicants’ co-accused, had requested the trial court to read out Mr K.’s statement. However, the Court is not convinced that in such circumstances the applicants’ right to cross-examine the witness was waived. In the Court’s view, where several persons are brought to trial, the defence rights of each of them must be equally respected as interests of the co-accused may be in conflict and a testimony in favour of one of them could have adverse implications for another. Accordingly, the Court does not find that there was a clear and unequivocal waiver of the applicants’ right to cross-examine Mr K.\n203: The Court notes that the domestic authorities made no particular effort to bring Mr L. and Mr K. before the trial court. The Government have put forward no convincing argument explaining the absence of Mr L. The Court considers that Mr L.’s testimony at the hearing would have been crucial for the establishment of the facts of the case as it could have supported or refuted the first applicant’s account of events given that the witness’s pre-trial statement had been corrected and its initial sense was not unambiguous (see paragraph 42 above). Neither does it appear that the trial court was particularly diligent in securing Mr K.’s attendance of the hearing despite the fact that he could have clarified in the courtroom whether the two men who he had seen in Mr R.’s flat had been the applicants or other persons (see paragraph 44 above).\n204: The Court therefore finds that there has been a breach of the applicants’ rights under Article 6 § 3 (d) in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the trial court’s failure to secure Mr L. and Mr K.’s presence at the hearing.\n205: The Court once again reiterates the general principles on admissibility of evidence (see paragraph 189 above). Further, it emphasises that Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a particular witness (see Laukkanen and Manninen v. , no. 50230/99, § 35, 3 February 2004). Article 6 § 3 (d) does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused’s behalf: its essential aim, as indicated by the words “under the same conditions”, is a full “equality of arms” in the matter (see Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, § 89 and Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235B, § 33). The Court reiterates that the principle of equality of arms implies that the applicant must be “afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent” (see Bulut v. Austria, judgment of 22 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, § 47). The concept of “equality of arms” does not, however, exhaust the content of paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6, nor that of paragraph 1, of which this phrase represents one application among many others. The task of the Court is to ascertain whether the proceedings at issue, considered as a whole, were fair as required by paragraph 1 (see, among other authorities, Delta v. France, judgment of 19 December 1990, Series A no. 191, p. 15,  § 35, and Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, § 33).\n206: The Court recalls that Mr I.P. and Mr M.A. were witnesses on the second applicant’s behalf from whom he had allegedly borrowed the money (see paragraph 12 above). It notes that it was disputed between the parties whether the trial court had summoned Mr I.P. and Mr M.A. or not. The Government submitted that the trial court had granted the second applicant’s request to summon Mr I.P. and Mr M.A. However, they failed to produce copies of summonses addressed to those individuals. Mr I.P. and Mr M.A. stated in their affidavits made in the presence of a notary that they had not received any summonses. The Court notes that the Government had an opportunity to comment on the affidavits but made no use of it. Accordingly, the Court finds that the second applicant substantiated his allegations by material evidence while the Government did not.\n207: The Court observes that, should the trial court have considered it unnecessary to summon Mr I.P. and Mr M.A., it could have dismissed the second applicant’s requests to summon the two witnesses on his behalf. However, the trial court formally granted such requests and thus agreed that the statements of Mr I.P. and Mr M.A. could have been relevant. The Court therefore considers that the trial court was under an obligation to take effective measures to ensure the witnesses’ presence at the hearing by way of, at the very least, issuing summonses. Having failed to do so, the trial court did not comply with its duty to ensure the presence of witnesses on the second applicant’s behalf on the same conditions as that of the prosecution witnesses and thus breached the “equality of arms” principle.\n208: It follows that there has been a breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the failure to summon Mr I.P. and Mr M.A.\n209: The Court observes that in the present case the identities of the police officers and the shop assistants who had allegedly seen the applicants on the night of the crime were not established. The Court further notes that the trial court found that those witnesses’ testimonies had not been crucial for the establishment of the applicants’ respective alibis (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). In such circumstances, and considering inevitable difficulties in identifying those persons and establishing their whereabouts that the trial court would have faced if agreed to summon them, the Court finds that the refusal to search for the unidentified witnesses and to summon them did not restrict the applicants’ defence rights to an impermissible extent.\n210: It follows that there has been no violation of Article 6 § 3 (d) in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in this respect.\n211: The applicants raised a number of other complaints alleging a breach of their Convention rights. In particular, they complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the proceedings against them had been excessively long; that the stipendiary judge, the lay judges and the court’s secretary had been partial; and that the trial court had relied on inadmissible evidence and erred in its assessment of the evidence. They further complained of the refusal to initiate supervisory-review proceedings in their case. Under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, they complained that the trial court had accused them of forgery when commenting on the origin of the correction in Mr L.’s statement. The first applicant complained that Mr T. had not attended the hearing immediately upon the defence’s request and that Mr. G. and Mr Tr. had not appeared before the trial court at all. The first applicant also complained that his legal-aid lawyer was incompetent. The second applicant complained that the trial court had relied upon his co-accused’s testimony given in court. In his letter of 10 July 2003 the second applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention that his lawyer had not been present at the appeal hearing. In their letter of 23 February 2004 the applicants complained under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention about the length of their pre-trial detention and about the fact that their arrest and the extension of their detention had been ordered by the prosecutor.\n212: Having regard to all the material in its possession, and as far as it is within its competence, the Court finds that the applicants’ submissions disclose no appearance of violations of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n213: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n214: The first applicant claimed 140,000 Russian roubles (RUB) and the second applicant claimed RUB 100,000 in respect of pecuniary damage that they had sustained as a result of the search and the seizure of their money. Further, the first applicant claimed RUB 252,000 and the second applicant claimed RUB 216,000 as loss of earnings that they would have received if they had not been detained. The first applicant claimed RUB 10,000 in compensation for medicines seized by the prison authorities. The second applicant claimed RUB 19,776 in compensation for expenses incurred in buying medicines.\n215: The Government contested these claims. They stated that the reasonableness of the national authorities’ actions on charging a person with a criminal offence was not subject to review within the framework of the proceedings before the Court. Furthermore, the Government noted that the applicants’ claims had not been confirmed by any official documents.\n216: The Court first notes that the applicants raised no complaints concerning the allegedly unlawful seizure of the money found in Mr R.’s flat. Accordingly, it does not discern any causal link between the violation of Article 6 of the Convention found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. Further, the Court cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the criminal proceedings against the applicants might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred (see, among other authorities, Popov v. , no. 26853/04, § 260, 13 July 2006; Schmautzer v. Austria, judgment of 23 October 1995, Series A no. 328-A, § 44; and Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, § 85). Therefore, the Court finds it inappropriate to award the applicants compensation for pecuniary damage for loss of earnings. Lastly, the Court finds no causal link between the violation of Article 6 of the Convention and the amounts spent on medicines; it therefore rejects this claim.\n217: Each applicant claimed 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the violations of their Convention rights.\n218: The Government contested the applicants’ claim and considered it unsubstantiated and excessive. In the Government’s view, the finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction in the present case.\n219: Inasmuch as the applicants’ claim relates to the finding of violations of Article 6 § 3 (d) in conjunction with Article 6 § 1, the Court reiterates that when an applicant has been convicted despite a potential infringement of his rights as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, he should, as far as possible, be put in the position in which he would have been had the requirements of that provision not been disregarded, and that the most appropriate form of redress would, in principle, be trial de novo or the reopening of the proceedings, if requested (see Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 210 in fine, ECHR 2005-IV; and Popov v. , no. 26853/04, § 263, 13 July 2006).  The Court notes, in this connection, that Article 413 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that criminal proceedings may be reopened if the Court finds a violation of the Convention.\n220: The Court finds in the present case that it is reasonable to assume that the applicants suffered distress and frustration caused by the unfairness of the criminal proceedings against them. Moreover, it has found a violation of Article 3 in respect of the first applicant who was subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment. Deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the first applicant EUR 8,000 and the second applicant EUR 5,000 for non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable to these amounts.\n221: As the applicant did not claim costs and expenses, the Court makes no award under this head.\n222: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

                "CASE OF MURTAZALIYEVA v. RUSSIA; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 36658/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Zara Khasanovna Murtazaliyeva (“the applicant”), on 16 September 2005.\n2: The applicant was represented by Mr K.N. Koroteyev, a lawyer practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, former Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.\n3: The applicant alleged, in particular, that the domestic courts had failed to ensure the examination of witness A. and attesting witnesses B. and K., and that she had been unable to see and examine effectively a secret surveillance videotape shown in the courtroom.\n4: The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). On 10 November 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.\n5: On 28 March 2017 a Chamber of that Section, composed of Helena Jäderblom, President, Branko Lubarda, Luis López Guerra, Helen Keller, Dmitry Dedov, Alena Poláčková, and Georgios A. Serghides, judges, and Fatoş Aracı, Deputy Section Registrar, gave judgment. The Chamber unanimously declared the above complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible. It held by four votes to three that there had been no violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention as regards the complaint concerning the absence of witness A. and by five votes to two that there had been no violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention as regards the complaint concerning the absence of attesting witnesses B. and K. The Chamber further held, unanimously, that there had been no violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention as regards the complaint concerning the applicant’s alleged inability to see and examine effectively a secret surveillance videotape shown in the courtroom. Three separate opinions were annexed to the judgment: (a) the partly concurring opinion of Judge Serghides; (b) the joint partly dissenting opinion of Judges López Guerra, Keller and Serghides; and (c) the joint dissenting opinion of Judges López Guerra and Serghides.\n6: In a letter of 9 August 2017 the applicant requested the referral of the case to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention. The panel of the Grand Chamber granted the request on 18 September 2017.\n7: The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 26 §§ 4 and 5 of the Convention and Rule 24. At the final deliberations, Péter Paczolay, substitute judge, replaced Erik Møse, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 24 § 3).\n8: The applicant and the Government each filed further written observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n9: A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 14 February 2018.\n10: The applicant was born in 1983 and currently lives in Paris.\n11: In September 2003 she arrived in Moscow from Chechnya and started working at an insurance company. In October 2003 she went to a mosque where she met V. and Ku., two young Russian women who had converted to Islam.\n12: In December 2003 the applicant was stopped on the street by two policemen for an identity check. She was then taken to a police station to have her identity verified. According to the applicant, she was released from custody several days later following the intervention of a certain A., who was also an ethnic Chechen and was employed as a police officer attached to the organised crime division of the Moscow police department. In the meantime she was dismissed by her employer because of her unauthorised absence from work.\n13: In February 2004 A. helped the applicant to be reinstated at work. He also found a flat for her, where he visited her on several occasions. The applicant shared the flat with V. and Ku. The flat was located in a dormitory block which belonged to the police department. It was equipped with concealed videotaping and audiotaping devices. The police placed the applicant under surveillance because she was suspected of affiliation with a terrorist group related to the Chechen insurgency movement. The Moscow City Court authorised the use of secret surveillance devices in the flat from 5 February until 4 March 2004.\n14: On the evening of 4 March 2004 the applicant was stopped by a police patrol for an identity check as her physical appearance allegedly matched the profile of a suspect in a wanted persons notice. The applicant immediately telephoned A., who spoke briefly with the police officers who had stopped her. The applicant was then taken to a police station because the official registration of her stay in Moscow had expired, which constituted an administrative offence under Russian law.\n15: At the police station, the applicant was informed that she had been apprehended (задержана). Her bag was searched by a female police officer I. in the presence of two attesting witnesses, B. and K., and her fingerprints were taken. The record of the personal search showed that the search of the applicant lasted from 8.35 p.m. until 9.03 p.m. During the personal search, I. discovered two square packages of an unknown substance wrapped in aluminium foil inside the applicant’s bag. The substance, together with the inner lining of the applicant’s bag and the pockets of her jacket, was taken for forensic examination. The forensic examination report stated that the applicant’s fingerprints were taken at 9.30 p.m. The police did not test the applicant’s hands for residue from the substance; nor did they check for her fingerprints on the packages found in her bag. Later the same day the applicant was arrested on charges of terrorism and questioned by the police. A criminal investigation was opened.\n16: On 12 March 2004 an expert examination of the substance found in the applicant’s bag was carried out. The examination report showed that the substance contained 196 grams of Plastit-4, an industrial explosive prepared using hexogen. In the course of the examination the explosives were destroyed. The examination of the applicant’s bag and the lining of the pockets of her jacket revealed the presence of hexogen.\n17: The police searched the flat where the applicant lived with V. and Ku. and seized a note that had been handwritten by the applicant. The note criticised Russian policy in Chechnya, spoke harshly of Russia and Russians, glorified suicide bombers, preached the way of jihad, vindicated acts of terrorism in Russia and included a statement about “...dreaming of falling [in a] martyr’s death as a shahid on the path of Allah”. The police also found several photographs of an escalator in the Okhotniy Ryad shopping centre in the centre of Moscow.\n18: A transcript of the conversations on the video tapes recorded at the flat showed that the applicant had been proselytising Islam to V. and Ku., discussing her hatred for Russians and the need for a “holy war” against them, praising the leaders of the Chechen insurgency, and telling her flatmates about the insurgent camps in the Caucasus.\n19: In the course of the investigation the applicant, represented by her defence lawyer, had pre-trial confrontations with witnesses V. and Ku. as well as with police officers S. and I., who had taken part in her arrest and personal search. The applicant had the opportunity to present her account of the events and to put relevant questions.\n20: On 12 October 2004 the applicant submitted the following motion to the investigating authorities.\n21: The next day an investigator granted the motion in the part concerning the questioning of A., questioned him and informed the applicant about the decision on her motion.\n22: When questioned A. testified that at the end of December 2003, on the order of his superiors, he had established a relationship of trust with the applicant, who had also introduced him to V. and Ku. He further stated that with the support of the police department he had helped the applicant to find accommodation. She had moved into a flat in the dormitory block belonging to the police department with V. and Ku. On 4 March 2004 the applicant had called him because she had been stopped by a police patrol. He had advised her to obey the orders of the police officers and to follow them to the police station.\n23: The applicant and her defence lawyer, who had been duly informed about the contents of the record of A.’s questioning, did not attempt to put any further questions to him, nor did they request the investigator to conduct a pre-trial confrontation.\n24: On 2 December 2004 the applicant received a copy of the case file for review. On 7 December 2004 the applicant was indicted with preparing an act of terrorism (an explosion) in the Okhotniy Ryad shopping centre and inciting V. and Ku. to commit an act of terrorism. The bill of indictment mentioned A. in the lists of both defence and prosecution witnesses to be summoned to the trial. However, A.’s testimony was merely mentioned by both the prosecution and the defence. The bill of indictment did not contain any information going beyond the statements made during the abovementioned questioning, and which were neither cross-referenced with any other evidence nor used to substantiate any specific factual or legal point.\n25: On 17 December 2004 the Moscow City Court held a preliminary hearing. It granted the applicant’s motion to consider her case in a single judge formation, scheduled the trial hearing and ordered that witnesses be called according to the lists presented by the parties and in the bill of indictment.\n26: On 22 December 2004 the applicant’s trial began before the city court. The applicant was represented by two lawyers of her own choosing, U. and S.\n27: The trial proceeded in the following manner.\n28: V. testified at the trial that she and Ku. had first met the applicant at a mosque in October 2003. They had become friends and had started frequenting Islamist Internet chat-rooms and surfing pro-insurgency websites together. After a while, they had decided to form a religious community (dzhamaat) to study Islam and live together. In their conversations the applicant had glorified terrorism and had approved of suicide bombings and the methods and targets of the Chechen insurgents. The applicant had told them about a camp near Baku in Azerbaijan where Muslims received training to become suicide bombers, and that she knew someone from there. She had mentioned that she herself had participated in the Chechen war on the side of the insurgents. Together they had often visited an Internet café in the Okhotniy Ryad shopping centre. The applicant had also taken photos of an escalator in the shopping centre from different positions.\n29: On 3 March 2004 the applicant had told V. and Ku. that if something were to happen to her, they would have to remove all Islamic literature and her diary from the flat, and that they were to call her mother in Chechnya. She had also told them that she had just received a call from a friend who had arrived in Moscow to “blow himself up”, and that she (that is, the applicant) “was in danger” and “under suspicion” [by the authorities]. The applicant had not threatened them and had not incited them to commit a terrorist act but had asked them if they were capable of doing so. She had constantly preached “the way of jihad” to them and had given them Islamist books and audiocassettes. Some of those books had been given to her by her acquaintance, A.\n30: V. denied having seen any explosives in the flat where they had lived.\n31: At the request of the prosecutor, the trial judge allowed V.’s pre-trial testimony to be read out, as it partly contradicted statements she had made at the trial. In particular, during her pre-trial questioning V. had testified that the applicant had undergone terrorist training in a camp near Baku and that she had been indoctrinating V. and Ku. in order to prepare them to become suicide bombers. Asked by the prosecutor to explain her contradictory statements, V. stated that she was not sure whether the applicant had really attended a terrorist training camp. However, she stated that the applicant had been preparing her and Ku. to become suicide bombers.\n32: During her cross-examination at trial, Ku. partly retracted her pretrial statements, which were for the most part similar to the above statements by V. During the trial Ku. confirmed that she, V. and the applicant had taken photos in the Okhotniy Ryad shopping centre at the applicant’s initiative, and that the applicant had “taken snapshots randomly”. In particular, the applicant had taken photographs of the escalator and the people on it. Ku. submitted that the applicant had disapproved of the policy of the Russian federal forces in the Caucasus. However, she had not incited Ku. to become a suicide bomber. According to Ku., they had simply wanted to reside together to pray, read and live free from parental supervision.\n33: Ku. further stated that the applicant’s acquaintance, A., was a policeman and that he had paid for the flat where the three of them had lived. He had also occasionally given them money. The applicant had once told her that she liked A.\n34: Ku. further stated that during the pre-trial questioning the investigator had misinterpreted her words concerning a suicide attack and that she had never planned to commit any such attack. She denied having given her pre-trial statements under pressure. In view of Ku.’s change of testimony her pre-trial statements were read out during the trial.\n35: Several police officers who had participated in the applicant’s arrest and personal search (P., S., B., I. and Ke.) were questioned in court. They stated that the applicant’s arrest had occurred during a regular patrol and they had not been aware that her bag contained explosives.\n36: P. testified that on the day of the applicant’s arrest he had decided to check the applicant’s documents because “she had been walking idly in the direction of the Prospekt Vernadskogo metro station”. She had shown them her passport and the registration stamp confirming her right to stay in Moscow, which had expired. The policemen took her to a police station. At the point of arrest she had been agitated and aggressive. They had decided to search her bag because such action “was compatible with the law”. P. further explained that he had stopped the applicant “because it had been unclear where she had been going to”, because she had “resembled a girl from a wanted persons notice”, and because she was “a person of Caucasian ethnicity [that is to say from the North Caucasus region]”. P. also stated that the expiry of her registration had been sufficient reason to arrest the applicant. He further testified that they had been routinely searching all individuals whose registration had expired.\n37: S.’s testimony was similar. He added that the applicant had been walking quickly and that she had started to threaten the police officers with disciplinary sanctions when they stopped her.\n38: B. testified that they had decided to stop the applicant because she had been wearing black clothing and was of “Caucasian ethnic origin”. He added that the applicant’s appearance had matched the description of someone on their wanted persons notice. He also testified that the applicant had her bag with her up until the moment of her personal search at the police station.\n39: The court also questioned the police officers who had been on duty at the Prospekt Vernadskogo police station on the day of the applicant’s arrest.\n40: I. testified that she had searched the applicant in the presence of two attesting witnesses and had found in her bag two square yellow objects wrapped in aluminium foil, which had later been confirmed to be explosives. The applicant’s fingerprints had been taken only once – after the objects had been discovered in her bag.\n41: Ke. testified that before the search the applicant had had all her personal belongings with her and that it had taken approximately twenty minutes before the start of the search to find attesting witnesses to observe the personal search.\n42: The prosecution extensively questioned all of the police officers about the circumstances of the applicant’s search and fingerprinting. All of them had consistently testified that the applicant had been in possession of her belongings, i.e. her handbag, at all times prior to the search and that she had been fingerprinted only once after the search. The defence only asked police officer B. whether the applicant had been in possession of her handbag prior to the search and police officer Ke. about the manner in which the attesting witnesses were chosen. Both of the questions were put to the above witnesses only once, and there was no relevant follow-up to their answers.\n43: The prosecution finished presenting their evidence on 12 January 2005 without either attempting to call A. to testify at the trial or referring to his pre-trial statements.\n44: At the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty to the charges against her. She testified that on 4 March 2004, after the police patrol had driven her to the police station, she had first been taken to a room where a police officer, S., had been filling in some papers. He had told her that she had been arrested and that her fingerprints would be taken. She had left her jacket and bag in that room. Another police officer, B., had then taken her to another room, where another police officer, L., had taken her fingerprints using ink. Afterwards, she had gone to a bathroom to wash the ink off her hands. When she returned to the first room, she was informed that she would be searched in the presence of two attesting witnesses B. and K. The police officer had searched the applicant’s bag and discovered two packages wrapped in aluminium foil, which did not belong to her. The applicant stated that her fingerprints had been taken before and after the search, and that only the second episode had been recorded.\n45: The applicant further stated that the police had questioned her in the absence of a lawyer, and had then decided to detain her. Furthermore, the applicant testified that she had been told to sign a record of her questioning, on pain of ill-treatment. Over the following days she had been beaten by the policemen who were questioning her. However, she had continued to deny her involvement in any terrorist activity.\n46: The applicant stated that the packages found in her bag had not belonged to her, that the police had planted them in her bag and that she had never incited V. and Ku. to commit a terrorist attack. When the prosecutor asked whether she had noticed that her rather small bag had become heavier than it was before the personal search, the applicant stated that she had not noticed anything conspicuous.\n47: She further stated that the six photographs of the escalator that had been seized from her flat had been taken by her. However, she had been photographing people at random in the shopping centre, rather than the escalator, and she had done so for recreational purposes.\n48: The applicant admitted writing the note that had been seized from the flat but stated that she had copied its text from the internet because she had liked it and had simply wanted to have a copy. The applicant’s lawyer argued that her words had been misinterpreted and that there had been nothing in them demonstrating a link to any terrorist activity. She stated that the applicant’s bitter perception of the situation in Chechnya was absolutely natural for someone who had been living in a war zone since childhood and that her words should have been analysed more carefully.\n49: At certain points in her testimony the applicant mentioned A. in passing, stating that they had no personal relationship, that he had helped her with finding accommodation free of charge, that he had called her on the phone, given her two books by the American historian Paul Klebnikov, and that he had told her to follow the policemen’s orders at the time of her arrest.\n50: On 13 January 2005, during the last day of the examination of evidence by the trial court, the applicant’s lawyer U. submitted a motion to play videotapes during the hearing. The relevant part of the trial records reads as follows:\n51: According to the trial records the defence submitted no requests or complaints concerning the quality of the video-recording or the manner in which the tape was played.\n52: Immediately after viewing the videotape the applicant’s lawyer S. submitted oral motions to summon attesting witnesses B. and K. and police officer A. The relevant part of the trial records reads as follows:\n53: Immediately afterwards the defence proceeded to submit evidence in the form of character references about the accused and lodged motions to subpoena the applicant’s phone records and conduct a forensic psychiatric examination of witnesses V. and Ku.; both motions were refused by the court. Subsequently the defence rested its case.\n54: The presiding judge inquired as to whether the parties wished to continue with further examination of evidence. Using that opportunity, the prosecution motioned to read out the applicant’s diary entries and the defence motioned to strike that evidence out.\n55: After consideration of the above motions the presiding judge repeatedly asked whether the parties were prepared to rest their cases in the absence of those witnesses who had not appeared. There were no objections from either the prosecution or the defence. The trial court closed the examination of evidence and, upon a motion of the defence, adjourned the proceedings until closing arguments on 17 January 2005.\n56: The State prosecutor in his closing argument gave an overview of the entire body of evidence, pointing out inconsistencies in the applicant’s allegations of her innocence and the absence of an act giving rise to a crime (both actus reus and mens rea). He asked the trial court to find the applicant guilty as charged and to sentence her to twelve years’ imprisonment.\n57: The applicant and her lawyers U. and S. in their closing arguments maintained that the applicant was innocent and that the prosecution had failed to prove her guilt. They provided their own account of the events, alleging that the substance of the accusation was based on misinterpretation of the applicant’s conversations and actions and that the explosives had been planted by the police. The speech by the lawyer U. included the following statement made in passing while describing the applicant’s attitude to the military conflict in Chechnya and religion: “I think that this whole criminal case is a set-up against Murtazaliyeva by law-enforcement agents.” For her part, the applicant’s speech contained the following relevant part:\n58: On 17 January 2005 the court convicted the applicant of preparing an act of terrorism (an explosion), inciting others to commit an act of terrorism and carrying explosives, and sentenced her to nine years’ imprisonment. The court considered the following evidence:\n59: The judgment referred to witness A.’s testimony only in one part, which read as follows:\n60: The judgment contained a detailed analysis of the trial and pre-trial testimony given by V. and Ku., the applicant’s flatmates, as well as the records of their pre-trial confrontations with the applicant. The court accepted the pretrial statements by V. and Ku. and the trial statements by V. as valid and persuasive, since they were coherent as well as consistent with the remaining body of evidence. As to the change in Ku.’s testimony at trial, the court considered this to be a strategy to assist the applicant and dismissed it. It noted in particular that Ku., assisted by a defence lawyer, had been repeatedly questioned during the pre-trial investigation and that she had never complained of being subjected to duress by the investigating authorities. When questioned at trial she did not dispute that her previous statements had been given voluntarily and without any psychological or physical influence. Ku. did not provide any reasons for making false pre-trial statements. Moreover, she stated in court that after a conversation with the applicant’s lawyer she had formally complained about psychological duress during questioning, but had subsequently withdrawn that complaint as being untrue.\n61: The court examined and dismissed the applicant’s claim that the explosives had been planted in her bag. It referred to the testimony by the patrol officers and the officers at the police station, who had denied those allegations, and to the fact that, according to the official report, the personal search of the applicant had preceded the taking of her fingerprints, and there had been no evidence that the fingerprints had been taken twice, as the applicant had alleged.\n62: The court further found that the applicant must have drafted the text of the handwritten note herself and that she had not copied it from Islamist websites on the internet, as she had claimed, since the note had contained modifications and corrections.\n63: The applicant and her lawyers appealed against her conviction. The statements of appeal submitted by the defence lawyer S. indicated the following:\n64: The lawyer U. in her statement of appeal stated in particular that the defence had requested witness A.’s attendance as both a defence and a prosecution witness. However, that motion had been denied by the trial court with reference to his absence, which was not supported by any documentary evidence.\n65: On 17 March 2005 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the judgment, reducing the applicant’s sentence to eight years and six months.\n66: The Supreme Court held that the videotape had been shown at the request of the defence and that no objections or complaints, including that not all of the videotapes had been shown, had been lodged with the court after the videotape had been played.\n67: The Supreme Court further considered that the questioning of A. had not been possible due to his absence on a work-related mission and that his pre-trial statement had been read out with the consent of the defence in accordance with Article 281 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As for the two attesting witnesses B. and K., their personal appearance had not been necessary since the applicant had claimed that the explosives had been planted in her bag before their arrival. In any event, the defence had agreed to proceed to the closing arguments and had not submitted any objections or additional requests about the examination of the applicant’s case.\n68: In June 2005 the applicant’s lawyer S. lodged a supervisory review complaint, referring, inter alia, to the trial court’s failure to summon and question witness A. and attesting witnesses B. and K. The complaint in the relevant part labelled A. as “a key witness”, who, following the instructions of his superiors, had “covered” the applicant for more than two months, provided her with a job and accommodation and controlled her actions and movements, including her arrest. In respect of the attesting witnesses the complaint stated that “the examination of the attesting witnesses could have resolved the significant contradictions in the statements [and] could have served as the basis to corroborate or disprove the circumstances immediately prior to the search.”\n69: On 13 September 2005 the Supreme Court rejected the supervisory review complaint.\n70: The Criminal Code of the Russian Federation of 13 June 1996, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, provides an exhaustive list of criminally punishable actions and regulates all substantive aspects of the criminal law in Russia.\n71: The Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation of 18 December 2001, which entered into force on 1 July 2002, regulates all procedural aspects of criminal trials in Russia.\n72: The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in deciding as either Trial or Appeal Chambers on individual criminal cases produced extensive case-law and developed general principles related to various aspects of criminal proceedings, including examination of witnesses.\n73: In Prosecutor v. Krstić (Decision on application for subpoenas, Case no. IT-98-33-A, 1 July 2003) the ICTY Appeals Chamber dealt with the request to examine additional witnesses in the appeal proceedings. It stated the following in relation to the general principles governing the relevance of witness testimony and the issuing of witness subpoenas:\n74: In Prosecutor v. Halilović (Decision on the issuance of subpoenas, Case no. IT-01-48-AR73, 21 June 2004) the ICTY Appeals Chamber affirmed that an applicant must demonstrate a reasonable basis that a witness is likely to give information that will materially assist the applicant with respect to clearly identified issues in the forthcoming trial. It further stressed with reference to prior case-law that “[t]he Trial Chamber is vested with discretion in determining whether the applicant succeeded in making the required showing, this discretion being necessary to ensure that the compulsive mechanism of the subpoena is not abused” and that “subpoenas should not be issued lightly, for they involve the use of coercive powers and may lead to the imposition of a criminal sanction” (ibid. § 6). It further provided the following guidance on the judicial decision-making in these matters:\n75: In Prosecutor v. Martić (Decision on appeal against the Trial Chamber’s decision on the evidence of witness Milan Babić, Case no. IT95-11-AR73.2, 14 September 2006) the ICTY Appeal Chamber discussed at length the principles applicable to examination of witnesses at trial. Referring to its own, as well as to this Court’s case-law, it recognised the Trial Chambers’ discretion in relation to the admissibility of evidence, as well as in defining the modalities of cross-examination and the exercise of this right by the defence. It stressed that such deference is based on the recognition of “the Trial Chamber’s organic familiarity with the day-to-day conduct of the parties and practical demands of the case”. The Appeals Chamber highlighted that the right of an accused to cross-examine a witness is not absolute, that the fairness of a trial must not be uniquely predicated on the fairness accorded to the accused and that while the proceedings must be conducted with full respect for the procedural rights, the restrictions on the right to cross-examination will not necessarily entail a violation or be inconsistent with a fair trial (ibid. §§ 6, 12).\n76: In respect of this Court’s principles pertinent to cross-examinations of witnesses the Appeal Chamber stated the following:\n77: In Prosecutor v. Edouard Karemera and Matthieu Ngirumpatse (Decision on Matthieu Ngirumpatse’s motion to subpoena witness YLH, Case no. ICTR-98-44-T, 29 December 2010) the ICTR Trial Chamber deciding on whether written statements of a certain witness ought to be admitted into evidence and whether that witness needed to be subpoenaed, restated the following principles:\n78: In Prosecutor v. Orić (Interlocutory decision on length of defence case, Case no. IT-03-68-AR73.2, 20 July 2005) the ICTY Appeals Chamber stated the following in respect of equality of arms in calling and examining witnesses:\n79: The Inter-American Court of Human Rights decides on individual complaints lodged under the American Convention of Human Rights of 1969. That Convention states the following in respect of the right to examine witnesses:\n80: In Canese v. Paraguay (Judgment of 31 August 2004, Series C. no. 111, §§ 164-65) the Inter-American Court found a violation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial, because “through judicial negligence, no testimonial evidence was provided [at the trial], eliminating the possibility of Mr Canese presenting probative material in his defence that could “throw light on the facts.” This conclusion had been reached with regard to the fact that the accused was not allowed to obtain a hearing for other persons who, as witnesses and expert witnesses, could “throw light on the facts” and that during the proceedings in the first instance, after having issued an order summoning the witnesses proposed by the defendant, the judge revoked this decision and ordered the evidentiary stage to be closed.\n81: In Norín Catrimán et al. v. Chile (Judgment of 29 May 2014, Series C no. 279, § 249) the Inter-American Court – confronted with several applications concerning the exclusive and untested use of anonymous witnesses’ statements at trials – indicated, inter alia referring to the case-law of this Court, that the use of anonymous witness statements must be subjected to judicial control and offset by counterbalancing measures, cautious treatment of that testimony, and availability of supporting and corroborative evidence. In respect of one of the applicants it concluded that he “had no available means of proof” for his case, because his reasoned and specific request to summon two defence witnesses had been initially granted by the investigating judge, but not enforced due to refusal of the witnesses to appear. Since no statements were taken from the defence witnesses and the applicant was convicted on the basis of testimony of three anonymous witnesses absent from trial, the Inter-American Court considered the right under Article 8 (2) (f) of the American Convention to be violated (§§ 25859).\n82: The applicant complained under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention that the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings against her had been undermined because she had not been able to see effectively a secret surveillance videotape shown in the courtroom. Article 6 of the Convention in the relevant part reads as follows:\n83: The Government contested that argument.\n84: The Chamber noted that the case materials contained no evidence that the applicant, either during the trial or on appeal, had complained that she had been unable to see the recording when it was being played. However, it concluded that there was no need to rule on the issue, since in any event the applicant had been able to follow the proceedings (see paragraphs 71-72 of the Chamber judgment). It further found that it had not been “strictly necessary” to see the recording, given that the applicant’s purpose in having the video tape played at the trial was to verify the accuracy of the transcripts. Listening to the tape was sufficient for that purpose.\n85: Unanimously, the Chamber held that there had been no violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention given that the defence had not alleged that there had been difficulties in hearing the audio track and had not disputed the authenticity of the recording itself (see paragraphs 73-74 of the Chamber judgment).\n86: The applicant did not mention in her referral request the finding of no violation as regards her ability to see the surveillance videotape shown during the hearing. However, in her submissions before the Grand Chamber, she invited the Court to draw inferences from the Government’s failure to produce the plans of the courtroom and the arrangements for viewing the video recording. She noted that only one tape had been played and she had been prevented from effectively participating in the viewing of it due to the absence of adequate arrangements. She alleged that there had been a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention.\n87: The Government maintained that the Chamber’s findings on this issue had not been contested in the applicant’s referral request and should therefore be confirmed. They endorsed the conclusions of the Chamber. The Government noted that the applicant had been able to follow the content of the videotape and that she had not raised any relevant objections or complaints during the trial. Her statement of appeal merely referred to technical difficulties in seeing the recording. Moreover, she had disputed neither the lawfulness nor the authenticity of the recording, nor had she claimed that the quality of the playback was poor. Since she had requested that the tape be played to verify the authenticity of the transcript, seeing the playback, apart from the fact of being able to hear the audio track, had not been necessary.\n88: The Court observes at the outset that the content and scope of the case referred to the Grand Chamber are delimited by the Chamber’s decision on admissibility. This means that the Grand Chamber may examine the case only in so far as it has been declared admissible; it cannot examine those parts of the application which have been declared inadmissible (see, for example, Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc. v. Switzerland [GC], no. 5809/08, § 78, 21 June 2016). The instant complaint was declared admissible, even if it did not form part of the applicant’s referral request.\n89: The Grand Chamber’s jurisdiction therefore extends to ascertaining whether the applicant had been prevented from effectively participating in the viewing of the videotape shown during the hearing as alleged, and, if so, whether this undermined the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings against her contrary to Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention.\n90: As the requirements of Article 6 § 3 are to be seen as particular aspects of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the Court will examine the complaint from the point of view of these two provisions taken together (see Simeonovi v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 21980/04, § 113, 12 May 2017; see also Lüdi v. Switzerland, 15 June 1992, § 43, Series A no. 238; and Vacher v. France, 17 December 1996, § 22, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI).\n91: The Court reiterates that Article 6, read as a whole, guarantees the right of an accused to participate effectively in a criminal trial, which includes, inter alia, not only his or her right to be present, but also to hear and follow the proceedings (see Stanford v. the United Kingdom, 23 February 1994, § 26, Series A no. 282A). The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment on them (see Zahirović v. Croatia, no. 58590/11, § 42, 25 April 2013, with further references). The facilities which should be enjoyed by everyone charged with a criminal offence include the opportunity to acquaint himself, for the purposes of preparing his defence, with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings (see C.G.P. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29835/96, 15 January 1997; Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 84, 15 November 2007; and Ibrahimov and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 69234/11 and 2 others, § 95, 11 February 2016, with further references).\n92: Having regard to the available material, the arguments presented by the parties, and the principles cited above, the Court sees no reason to depart from the Chamber’s conclusions.\n93: It observes that only one surveillance videotape was viewed during the hearing. It was shown upon a motion by the defence to view that specific tape in order to verify the accuracy of the transcript (see paragraph 50 above). No motion to view other videotapes was lodged by the defence, and it is not disputed that they were available for examination in court had either of the parties submitted a motion to that effect. Moreover, the transcripts of the conversations recorded on these tapes had been included in the criminal case file and were available for examination.\n94: Regarding the alleged technical difficulties when viewing the tape mentioned in her statement of appeal (see paragraph 63 above), the applicant did not explain either to the domestic courts or to this Court what those difficulties were. Furthermore, the record of the trial and other documents in the case file contain no indication of any complaints having been made by the applicant about the quality of the audio track of the recording. The failure of the Government to provide the plans of the courtroom and the arrangements for viewing the video-recording highlighted by the applicant cannot in itself serve as a ground for the drawing of any “inferences” of unfairness in the proceedings.\n95: The Court is satisfied that the applicant was able to participate effectively in the viewing of the videotape in a way which satisfied her procedural needs, namely verifying the accuracy of the transcript by comparing it to the audio track of the recording. It follows that there has been no violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention in this regard.\n96: The applicant complained under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention that the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings against her had been undermined because she had not been able to call and examine witness A. at the trial. The relevant part of Article 6 of the Convention reads as follows:\n97: The Government contested that argument.\n98: The Chamber, having reaffirmed that it is primarily for the domestic courts to decide on the relevance of evidence the defence seeks to adduce and that it was the Court’s task to ascertain whether the proceedings, considered as a whole, had been fair, decided the case on the basis of the test derived from the judgment in the case of Perna v. Italy ([GC], no. 48898/99, § 29, ECHR 2003V) and the subsequent case-law (see paragraph 84 of the Chamber judgment). It examined (a) whether the applicant’s request was sufficiently reasoned and relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and could arguably have strengthened the position of the defence or have even led to the applicant’s acquittal; and (b) whether the trial court, by not securing the attendance of a particular witness to testify on behalf of the applicant, had breached her right under Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.\n99: In the first place, the Chamber observed that the testimony given by A. during the pre-trial stage had not been disputed by the applicant. While acknowledging that A.’s testimony might have had at least some relevance to the charges, the Chamber answered the first part of the test in the negative. It considered that the defence had failed to explain, even briefly, why the attendance of A. was important for their line of defence, whether his actions had amounted to entrapment or whether he had exerted any pressure on the applicant and, finally, whether his testimony would have served to exonerate the applicant or, at the very least, strengthened her position in any way (see paragraph 87 of the Chamber judgment). As regards the applicant’s allegations of entrapment, the Chamber specifically observed that they had been raised for the first time in the applicant’s observations before the Court. Accordingly, it concluded that the applicant had failed to support her request to question A. with sufficient reasons (ibid.). Further, the Chamber examined the overall fairness of the proceedings and concluded that the applicant’s conviction had been based on a range of evidence. Despite A.’s absence from the trial his pre-trial statements had been read out at trial and the applicant was able to comment on them as well as on the other evidence.\n100: Accordingly, the Chamber concluded, by a majority, that there had been no violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention as regards the absence of witness A. (see paragraphs 88-89 of the Chamber judgment).\n101: The applicant contended that A. was a “key witness” and his activities had led to the creation of the body of evidence against her. Accordingly, his activities could be likened to those of an agent provocateur. She maintained that she had consistently and explicitly referred to possible entrapment in her submissions before the domestic courts. She had underlined A.’s central role to the investigating authorities and the courts and insisted that he be questioned directly.\n102: While admitting that her lawyer S. had requested the questioning of A. at trial without putting forward specific reasons, she argued that the importance and relevance of A.’s testimony could have been inferred from references to him during her own examination and her flatmates’ earlier questioning.\n103: As regards the applicable Convention standard, the applicant invited the Grand Chamber to revise the Perna approach, at least for cases where the defence requests the examination of a witness whose attendance it has been unable to secure, for example law-enforcement officials, and whom the prosecution does not call for questioning. In her opinion, the Perna approach was “mechanical” and devoid of substantive criteria and placed an unduly high burden on the defence, which was required to justify calling a witness over whom the prosecution could have control.\n104: In support of the above argument the applicant referred to the evolution of the applicable standard for prosecution witnesses in AlKhawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, ECHR 2011, and Schatschaschwili v. Germany [GC], no. 9154/10, ECHR 2015, as well as the current trends in entrapment and peaceful assembly case-law (she referred to Bannikova v. Russia, no. 18757/06, § 73, 4 November 2010, and Navalnyy and Yashin v. Russia, no. 76204/11, § 83, 4 December 2014). In her opinion, these developments indicated that domestic courts were required to employ a heightened standard of review in verifying incriminating evidence. Referring to the practice of the Inter-American Court (Canese v. Paraguay and Norín Catrimán et al. v. Chile, paragraphs 80-81 above), the ICTY Appeals Chamber (Prosecutor v. Martić; Prosecutor v. Halilović; and Prosecutor v. Krstić, paragraphs 73-75 above) and the United States Supreme Court (Cruz v. New York, 481 US 186 (1987), and Lilly v. Virginia 527 US 116 (1999)), she argued that international law concerning the examination of witnesses had advanced beyond the Perna standard and that it was necessary to call not only witnesses who could give evidence capable of leading to acquittal, but “generally witnesses of fact”.\n105: The applicant submitted that the domestic courts had failed to ensure the presence of witness A., despite his role as a covert agent. It had been convincingly shown that he was the key witness and the domestic courts had relied on his testimony for her conviction. In her opinion, A. was both a defence and a prosecution witness and the courts should have compelled his attendance.\n106: The Government addressed two preliminary points of disagreement with the applicant regarding the manner in which the examination of A. at trial had been requested.\n107: First, they stated that the trial records accurately and adequately reflected the progress of the proceedings. In support of that argument they referred to the fact that the defence had not challenged the trial records pertaining to the request to question A., whereas they had filed detailed and elaborate objections to the content of the trial records on various other points. Furthermore, one of the applicant’s lawyers had expressly agreed to the unchallenged parts of the records.\n108: Second, the applicant’s contention that she had consistently raised an entrapment defence at the domestic level contradicted the case material. They stated that the applicant did not advance an agent provocateur issue until the submission of her observations before the Court, and no such allegation had been made by the defence when requesting the attendance of A. The Government claimed that any entrapment complaint was in any event manifestly ill-founded, since the applicant had refuted her involvement in the crime she had been charged with. In support of their position they referred to the Court’s decision in Koromchakova v. Russia (dec.) (no. 19185/05, § 19, 13 December 2016).\n109: Turning to the subject-matter of the present complaint, the Government suggested that the fairness of the proceedings in terms of the examination of defence witnesses should be assessed using the following test:\n110: The Government concluded that the applicant failed already at the first step of the test. They highlighted that the defence had only once submitted a motion to examine A., had not objected to the reading out of his pre-trial testimony, although the procedural legislation afforded such an opportunity and, in fact, had largely concurred with the contents of the statements read out. Given the parties’ consent to the reading out of A.’s statements and in the absence of any motion to adjourn the proceedings, the trial court had continued with the case as the parties had seen fit. Accordingly, in the Government’s opinion, the applicant had failed to take the minimal procedural actions necessary for the exercise of her right to examine A; she had limited herself to A.’s pre-trial questioning and had clearly and explicitly waived her right to examine him at trial.\n111: Despite the above assertion the Government nevertheless proceeded to the second step of their test and argued that the applicant had not adduced sufficient reasons for the questioning of A. On the factual side they highlighted that during the pre-trial proceedings the applicant had lodged a request to question A. seven months after her arrest and the start of the investigation. She had put only factual questions to him, which were not related to the charges against her, and the defence had failed to put further questions to A. after receiving the answers to the initial questions.\n112: They further stated that in any event the applicant’s questions could have been answered by other witnesses examined at the trial. Moreover, the prosecution did not refer to A.’s testimony and the courts did not rely on A.’s testimony in convicting her.\n113: Given the negative answers to the first two limbs of the test, they concluded that it was not necessary to examine the third limb.\n114: The Court takes note of the Government’s argument that the applicant had waived her right to examine witness A. at the trial. It considers that this argument must be examined as a preliminary objection to the admissibility of this complaint (see, in this connection, Palchik v. Ukraine, no. 16980/06, §§ 36-38, 2 March 2017, and Giurgiu v. Romania (dec.), no. 26239/09, § 99, 3 October 2017).\n115: It reiterates that under Article 35 § 4 in fine of the Convention it can “reject any application which it considers inadmissible ... at any stage of the proceedings”. Thus, even at the merits stage and subject to Rule 55 of the Rules of Court, the Grand Chamber may reconsider a decision to declare an application admissible where it concludes that it should have been declared inadmissible for one of the reasons given in the first three paragraphs of Article 35 of the Convention (see Regner v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 35289/11, § 97, 19 September 2017, referring to Vučković and Others v. Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29 others, § 56, 25 March 2014, with further references).\n116: In their submissions before the Chamber and the Grand Chamber the Government argued that the applicant and her counsel had clearly and explicitly waived the right to obtain the attendance and examination of witness A. by consenting to the reading out of his pre-trial statements at trial.\n117: Neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial. However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, such a waiver must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance. A waiver need not be explicit, but it must be voluntary and constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be. Moreover, the waiver must not run counter to any important public interest (see Simeonovi, cited above, § 115 with further references).\n118: It follows that a waiver of the right to examine a witness, a fundamental right among those listed in Article 6 § 3 which constitute the notion of a fair trial, must be strictly compliant with the above requirements.\n119: Turning to the present case, the Court observes that the applicant, assisted by her defence lawyers, consented to the reading out of witness A.’s pre-trial statements at the hearing of 13 January 2005 (see paragraph 52 above). Significantly, the applicant neither disputed the accuracy of the relevant trial records nor alleged that she had not had the benefit of appropriate legal advice on the matter.\n120: It further notes that in several previous cases dealing with analogous situations the Court had regard to various factual and legal circumstances in reaching the conclusion that the applicants had either waived (see, for example, Khametshin v. Russia, no. 18487/03, § 41, 4 March 2010; Poletan and Azirovik v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 26711/07 and 2 others, § 87, 12 May 2016; and Palchik, cited above, § 36) or not waived the right to examine a witness (see, for example, Bocos-Cuesta v. the Netherlands, no. 54789/00, § 66, 10 November 2005; Makeyev v. Russia, no. 13769/04, § 37, 5 February 2009; and Gabrielyan v. Armenia, no. 8088/05, § 85, 10 April 2012).\n121: The Court must now determine whether in the circumstances of the present case the applicant had waived her right to examine witness A. It notes at the outset that nothing in the available material suggests that her actions had not been voluntary or had run counter to any important public interest.\n122: Having regard to the trial records, it is to be noted that the defence had agreed in an unequivocal manner to the reading out of A.’s pre-trial statements. On the last day of the examination of evidence, lawyer S. requested the court to summon witness A. The presiding judge then informed the parties that this witness was not available, whereupon the prosecutor requested that witness A.’s pre-trial statements be read out. Lawyer U. did not object to the reading out, and lawyer S. explicitly agreed to this (see paragraph 52 above).\n123: Subsequently, the presiding judge, before closing the examination of the evidence, inquired as to whether the parties were prepared to rest their cases in the absence of those witnesses who had not appeared. The applicant did not raise any objections and, in particular, she did not repeat her request to hear witness A. at the trial (see paragraphs 52-55 above).\n124: However, Russian criminal procedure law had afforded the applicant an opportunity to object, even without invoking any reasons, to the reading out of these statements. Had she done so and had she insisted on A. being summoned, the trial court could have read out A.’s pre-trial statements only in the specific circumstances prescribed in Article 281 § 2 CCrP (see paragraph 71 above). If these requirements were not met, adjourning the hearing and re-summoning of witness A. would have been a possible way to proceed.\n125: The applicant, at the trial court, was represented by two professional lawyers of her own choosing. Nothing suggests that they were not aware of the consequences of their having agreed to the reading out of A.’s statements, namely that they would lose the possibility to have the witness heard before the trial court and that his statements would be taken into consideration by the court when deciding on the charges against the applicant.\n126: Furthermore, nothing in the applicable legislation or in judicial practice prevented the defence from lodging subsequent motions to examine A. in the appeal proceedings. However, the applicant, again assisted by two lawyers, chose not to use that possibility either. Regard must also be had to the fact that at no point in the proceedings, either before the domestic courts or this Court, has the applicant alleged that the services of her lawyers were inadequate.\n127: The above considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the applicant, by agreeing to the reading out of witness A.’s pre-trial statements and by not insisting on her request that he be heard in court, waived her right to examine that particular witness (see Palchik, cited above, § 36). This waiver was attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance. In this respect, the Court reiterates that the applicant was assisted by two lawyers and was explicitly asked by the presiding judge whether she was prepared to rest her case in the absence of the witness, a course of action she did not object to. It also observes that the applicant had the possibility to comment on A.’s statements, but did not advance any substantive objections to their content (see paragraph 52 above). Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the case raised any questions of public interest preventing the specific procedural guarantees from being waived (see Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 79, ECHR 2006XII). No reason can be discerned to doubt that the applicant’s waiver constituted a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right and that she could, with the assistance of her two lawyers, reasonably have foreseen the consequences of her conduct (see, Khametshin, cited above, § 41, and, Palchik, cited above, § 36; a contrario, Sakhnovskiy v. Russia [GC], no. 21272/03, §§ 91-92, 2 November 2010).\n128: Consequently, the Court upholds the Government’s preliminary objection and dismisses the applicant’s complaint about the absence of witness A. at her trial as manifestly ill-founded according to Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention.\n129: The applicant complained under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention that the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings against her had been undermined because she had not been able to call and examine at the trial the two attesting witnesses B. and K.\n130: The Government contested that argument.\n131: The Chamber observed that under Russian law, attesting witnesses are invited by the investigator to act as neutral observers of an investigative measure. Unlike material witnesses, they are not expected to have any knowledge of the case and they do not testify as regards the circumstances of the case or an accused’s guilt or innocence (see Shumeyev and Others v. Russia (dec.), no. 29474/07 and 3 others, § 31, 22 September 2015).\n132: Having established that the trial court did not rely on any statements that B. and K. had made during the proceedings either in favour of the applicant or against her and that they could have testified only about the manner in which the search had been carried out and its results, the Chamber considered that their testimony was incapable of influencing the outcome of the applicant’s trial (see paragraphs 96-97 of the Chamber judgment).\n133: The Chamber found, by a majority, that there had been no violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) (paragraph 98 of the Chamber judgment).\n134: The applicant maintained that even if she had not insisted on the questioning of the attesting witnesses, her lawyers had done so. They considered their testimony to have been relevant to establishing the circumstances of her personal search at the police station and to clarifying how the attesting witnesses had come to be chosen. Accordingly, in her opinion, there had been a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.\n135: The Government supported the Chamber’s conclusions on this point. They stated that summoning the attesting witnesses was not necessary given that their testimony had not been used by the domestic courts. These two persons were unable to give evidence about the alleged planting of explosives in the applicant’s bag since this had purportedly taken place before her search in their presence. The motion to summon them was lodged only once. The motion was denied by the domestic courts, and the defence did not insist on it any further. Referring to Shumeyev and Others, cited above, the Government further maintained that nothing indicated that the attesting witnesses would have been able to provide any evidence beyond that already available to the courts.\n136: The Court observes that Russian criminal procedure contains separate provisions on material witnesses (свидетели) and attesting witnesses (понятые) and uses different terms to distinguish between them. Attesting witnesses are invited by an investigator to act as neutral observers of an investigative measure. They are not considered to be witnesses for the prosecution or the defence, since, unlike material witnesses, they have no knowledge of the case and they do not testify about the circumstances of the case or a defendant’s guilt or innocence. The absence of attesting witnesses from criminal trials does not infringe the guarantees of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention insofar as their testimony is limited to the manner of conducting investigative measures and is, in essence, redundant evidence (see Shumeyev and Others, cited above, § 37).\n137: However, it is to be noted that the above principles were developed in a context where the testimony of the attesting witnesses had been adduced by the prosecution.\n138: In the present case it was the defence who intended to rely on the testimony of the attesting witnesses B. and K. in order to support their claim that the explosives had been planted in the applicant’s handbag prior to her personal search. Viewed in that light, B. and K.’s testimony would have ranged beyond the mere modalities of the search and the information subsequently entered in the police records. Therefore, B. and K. are to be considered as “witnesses on behalf” of the applicant within the meaning of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.\n139: The Court reiterates that under Article 6 of the Convention the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and the Court’s task is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 50, Reports 1997III, and Perna, cited above, § 29). Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused’s behalf, the essential aim of that provision, as indicated by the words “under the same conditions” is to ensure a full “equality of arms” in the matter (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 91, Series A no. 22, and Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, § 33, Series A no. 235B).\n140: In its judgment in the Perna case (cited above, § 29), extensively referred to by the parties and the Chamber, the Court summarised the principles applicable to the calling and examining of defence witnesses. First of all, as a general rule, it is for the domestic courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce and Article 6 § 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call a particular witness. Second, it is not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he or she has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he or she must, in addition, support the request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth.\n141: The test as formulated in Perna essentially consists of two questions: firstly, whether the applicant substantiated his or her request to call a particular witness by referring to the relevance of that individual’s testimony for “the establishment of the truth” and secondly, whether the domestic courts’ refusal to call that witness undermined the overall fairness of the proceedings (see Perna, cited above, §§ 29, 32).\n142: It is instructive to examine the development of the approach established in Perna in the subsequent case-law and the difficulties to which its practical application has given rise.\n143: It has been repeatedly clarified by the Court that when a defence witness’ testimony is capable of reasonably establishing an accused’s alibi such a witness is considered prima facie relevant (see, for example, Polyakov v. Russia, no. 77018/01, § 34, 29 January 2009). On the contrary, in a case where the examination of a defence witness had been requested in order to establish an issue beyond the scope of a charge or the testimony had been incapable of proving the accused’s innocence, the absence of the witness had not compromised the fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Tymchenko v. Ukraine, no. 47351/06, § 92, 13 October 2016). The Court has also stressed that a domestic court is not required to answer clearly vexatious requests to call defence witnesses (see Dorokhov v. Russia, no. 66802/01, § 72, 14 February 2008).\n144: An applicant satisfies Article 6 § 3 (d) requirements if he or she submits a request which is sufficiently reasoned, relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and can arguably strengthen the position of the defence or lead to his or her acquittal (see Dorokhov, cited above, §§ 67-72, and Polyakov, cited above, § 34). Applicants are required to explain to the domestic courts with sufficient clarity why the examination of a particular witness is necessary (see Miminoshvili v. Russia, no. 20197/03, § 122, 28 June 2011).\n145: The significance of a defence witness’ testimony needs to be weighed against its ability to influence the outcome of a trial. For example, calling a witness who, it is claimed, might have supported an accused’s allegation that he was ill-treated in order to make him confess to an offence, might not be necessary if the impugned confession did not play a crucial role in establishing the applicant’s guilt (see Tarasov v. Ukraine, no. 17416/03, § 105, 31 October 2013). Once the national authorities themselves recognise the relevance of a defence witness’ statement, for example, by referring to his statements in a bill of indictment and repeatedly granting requests to call that witness, then if in the further course of the proceedings that witness is not summoned it might not be necessary for the defence to provide the domestic courts with further detailed reasons for his examination (see Pello v. Estonia, no. 11423/03, § 33, 12 April 2007).\n146: When the defence requests the examination of a witness who could have arguably strengthened the position of the defence or whose testimony could even have given rise to an acquittal, the domestic authorities must provide relevant reasons for dismissing such a request (see Topić v. Croatia, no. 51355/10, § 42, 10 October 2013). In this context a reference by the courts to other facts of the case, which indicate why a witness could not have supplied new or important information, might be sufficient (see Sergey Afanasyev v. Ukraine, no. 48057/06, § 70, 15 November 2012, and Janyr v. the Czech Republic, no. 42937/08, §§ 81-82, 31 October 2013).\n147: The Court has noted that a decision to call a defence witness at a certain point during the investigation or trial and the subsequent absence of that witness from trial is significant, but not in itself conclusive (compare Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, § 188, 13 July 2006, where the absence of the witness led to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention, and Andrey Zakharov v. Ukraine, no. 26581/06, §§ 61-62, 7 January 2016, where it did not). However, once the domestic courts have accepted, at least in principle, that the examination of a witness for the defence was relevant, they have an obligation to take “effective” measures to ensure the witness’ presence at the hearing by way of, at the very least, issuing a summons (see Polufakin and Chernyshev v. Russia, no. 30997/02, § 207, 25 September 2008) or by ordering the police to compel a witness to appear in court (see Pello, cited above, § 34).\n148: It is only in exceptional circumstances that the Court will be led to conclude that the failure to hear a witness was incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention (see Bricmont v. Belgium, 7 July 1989, § 89, Series A no. 158). The dismissal of a request without giving reasons or the “silence” of the domestic courts in respect of a sufficiently reasoned and relevant request to call a defence witness does not necessarily lead to a finding of a violation of Article 6 (see Dorokhov, cited above, §§ 74-75). Since the overall fairness of the proceedings is an overriding criterion under Article 6 an applicant has to demonstrate not only that a particular defence witness was not examined, but also that the examination of that witness was necessary and that the refusal to call the witness prejudiced the rights of the defence (see Guilloury v. France, no. 62236/00, § 55, 22 June 2006, with further reference).\n149: It must be reiterated that it is not the function of this Court to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a domestic court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 162, ECHR 2010). In the determination of whether the proceedings were fair this Court does not act as a court of fourth instance deciding on whether the evidence had been obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law, its admissibility or on the guilt of an applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Gäfgen, cited above, § 162; Tseber v. the Czech Republic, no. 46203/08, § 42, 22 November 2012; and Nikolitsas v. Greece, no. 63117/09, § 30, 3 July 2014). These matters, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, are the province of the domestic courts. It is not appropriate for this Court to rule on whether the available evidence was sufficient for an applicant’s conviction and thus to substitute its own assessment of the facts and the evidence for that of the domestic courts. The Court’s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly and that in a given case they were compatible with the Convention, while also taking into account the specific circumstances, the nature and the complexity of the case (see Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, § 84, ECHR 2010, and Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 118).\n150: Before the Grand Chamber the applicant urged the Court to revise the existing Perna standard since, in her opinion, the existing principles were “mechanical” in their application and devoid of substantive criteria, and placed an unduly high burden on the defence. She argued that the rules of international law concerning the examination of witnesses had evolved considerably beyond the Perna standard in that the burden on the defence to show the need to call a particular witness for questioning had decreased and the trial court’s review of the reasons for the failure to appear and of the consequences of that failure for the overall fairness of the proceedings had assumed greater significance. The applicant referred inter alia to the practice of the ICTY Appeals Chamber and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (see paragraph 104 above).\n151: Having carefully considered the practice of other international tribunals referred to in the submissions, the Court does not discern any elements capable of supporting the applicant’s claim. On the contrary, the case-law of the ICTY Appeals Chamber and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights demonstrates that the general principles employed by these tribunals for the evaluation of the overall fairness of criminal proceedings are comparable, if not identical, to the principles developed by this Court. The Court also observes that the international tribunals mentioned above have extensively referred to this Court’s case-law in formulating their own principles (see paragraphs 75 and 81 above).\n152: That being said, the Court considers it useful in the present case to clarify the general principles concerning the examination of defence witnesses as formulated in its case-law under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.\n153: The applicable Perna test consists of two questions: firstly, whether the applicant has substantiated his or her request to call a particular witness by referring to the relevance of that individual’s testimony for “the establishment of the truth” and, secondly, whether the domestic courts’ refusal to call that witness undermined the overall fairness of the proceedings (see paragraph 141 above).\n154: However, a careful study of the case-law reveals that despite generally following the above approach the Court has also consistently examined the manner in which the domestic courts decided on a request to call a certain witness. The conduct and decision-making of the domestic courts have attracted independent scrutiny and were weighty factors in the Court’s analysis in the great majority of pre- and post-Perna cases (see, among many other examples, Bricmont, cited above, § 89; Destrehem v. France, no. 56651/00, §§ 41-45, 18 May 2004; Asci v. Austria (dec.), no. 4483/02, 19 October 2006; Popov, cited above, § 188; Polyakov, cited above, § 35; Tarău v. Romania, no. 3584/02, §§ 74-76, 24 February 2009; and Topić, cited above, § 42). The Court’s careful and deferential examination of the domestic courts’ reasoning is in line with the established principles that, firstly, those courts are best placed to assess the relevance and admissibility of evidence and, secondly, that only exceptional circumstances will prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to hear a particular person as a witness was incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention.\n155: Therefore the question whether the domestic courts considered the relevance of that individual’s testimony and provided sufficient reasons for their decision not to examine a witness at trial must be recognised as an independent and integral component of the test under Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.\n156: It appears that the judicial assessment of the relevance of a witness’ testimony and the reasoning of the domestic courts in their response to the defence’s request to examine a witness provide the logical link between the two elements of the Perna test and have operated as an implicit substantive element of that test. The Court considers it desirable in the interests of clarity and consistency of practice to make this element explicit (see, similarly, Perez v. France [GC], no. 47287/99, § 54-56, ECHR 2004I).\n157: This development appears to be in line with the recent case-law under Article 6 of the Convention stressing the decisive importance of the domestic courts’ duty to engage in a careful scrutiny of the relevant issues if the defence advances a sufficiently reasoned claim. For example, the Court in the Grand Chamber judgment in the case of Dvorski v. Croatia ([GC], no. 25703/11, § 109, ECHR 2015) maintained that when the domestic authorities are presented with a legal challenge which might influence the overall fairness of the proceedings they must engage in a careful scrutiny of the issues, take steps to establish the relevant circumstances, and provide reasons adequate for their decisions. In a similar way, in agent provocateur cases the Court has stated that when “confronted with a plausible – and even arguable – allegation” of entrapment the courts “should have had regard to whether the results of the test purchases were admissible as evidence, in particular verifying that they were not tainted by incitement” (see Lagutin and Others v. Russia, nos. 6228/09 and 4 others, § 118, 24 April 2014).\n158: Where a request for the examination of a witness on behalf of the accused has been made in accordance with domestic law, the Court, having regard to the above considerations, formulates the following three-pronged test:\n159: The Court considers that the existing case-law already provides a solid basis for the application of all three steps of the test, but finds it appropriate to provide the following guidance for the examination of future cases.\n160: In respect of the first element the Court notes that under the Perna test the issue of whether an accused substantiated his or her request to call a witness on his or her behalf is decided by reference to the relevance of that individual’s testimony for “the establishment of the truth”. While certain post-Perna cases examined whether a witness’ testimony was relevant for the “establishment of the truth”, others relied on its ability to influence the outcome of a trial (see Tarasov, cited above, § 105), reasonably establish an accused’s alibi (see Polyakov, cited above, § 34), arguably lead to an acquittal (see Dorokhov, cited above, § 72) or arguably strengthen the position of the defence or even lead to the applicant’s acquittal (see Topić, cited above, § 42). What appears to unite all of the above standards is the relevance of a witness’s testimony to the subject matter of the accusation and its ability to influence the outcome of the proceedings. In the light of the evolution of its case-law under Article 6 of the Convention the Court considers it necessary to clarify the standard by bringing within its scope not only motions of the defence to call witnesses capable of influencing the outcome of a trial, but also other witnesses who can reasonably be expected to strengthen the position of the defence.\n161: The relevance of testimony is thus also determinative of the assessment of whether an applicant has advanced “sufficient reasons” for his or her request to call a witness, since the strength of reasoning considered “sufficient” depends on the role of that testimony in the circumstances of any given case (see Pello, cited above, § 33, largely reflecting this approach). It is impossible to evaluate in the abstract whether certain reasons for the examination of a witness could be considered sufficient and relevant to the subject matter of the accusation. This assessment necessarily entails consideration of the circumstances of a given case, including the applicable provisions of the domestic law, the stage and progress of the proceedings, the lines of reasoning and strategies pursued by the parties and their procedural conduct. Admittedly, the relevance of a defence witness’ testimony might be so apparent in certain cases that even scant reasoning given by the defence would be sufficient to answer the first question of the test in the affirmative (compare Pello, cited above, § 33).\n162: The second element of the test requires the domestic courts to consider the relevance of the testimony sought by the defence and obliges them to provide sufficient reasons for their decisions. These requirements are well-established in the Court’s case-law (see, for example, Popov, cited above, § 188, and Topić, cited above, § 42).\n163: The Court reiterates that, on the one hand, under Article 6 of the Convention the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and the domestic courts are best placed to decide on the issue and, on the other hand, Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused’s behalf, but aims to ensure equality of arms in the matter. Within this framework it is primarily for the domestic courts to scrutinise carefully the relevant issues if the defence advances a sufficiently reasoned request to examine a certain witness.\n164: Any such assessment would necessarily entail consideration of the circumstances of a given case and the reasoning of the courts must be commensurate, i.e. adequate in terms of scope and level of detail, with the reasons advanced by the defence.\n165: Since the Convention does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on behalf of the accused, the courts cannot be expected to give a detailed answer to every motion of the defence but must provide adequate reasons (for a similar logic in the context of the courts’ obligation to address appeal arguments, see Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands, 19 April 1994, § 61, Series A no. 288, and Boldea v. Romania, no. 19997/02, § 30, 15 February 2007).\n166: Generally the relevance of testimony and the sufficiency of the reasons advanced by the defence in the circumstances of the case will determine the scope and level of detail of the domestic courts’ assessment of the need to ensure a witness’ presence and examination. Accordingly, the stronger and weightier the arguments advanced by the defence, the closer must be the scrutiny and the more convincing must be the reasoning of the domestic courts if they refuse the defence’s request to examine a witness.\n167: The Court considers that the examination of the impact which a decision refusing to examine a defence witness at the trial has on the overall fairness of the proceedings is indispensable in every case (see, in different contexts, Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, §§ 250-52, 13 September 2016; Dvorski, cited above, § 82; and Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 101). Compliance with the requirements of a fair trial must be examined in each case having regard to the development of the proceedings as a whole and not on the basis of an isolated consideration of one particular aspect or one particular incident (see Ibrahim and Others, cited above, § 251).\n168: In the Court’s opinion, the preservation of overall fairness as the final benchmark for the assessment of the proceedings ensures that the above three-pronged test does not become excessively rigid or mechanical in its application. While the conclusions under the first two steps of that test would generally be strongly indicative as to whether the proceedings were fair, it cannot be excluded that in certain, admittedly exceptional, cases considerations of fairness might warrant the opposite conclusion.\n169: As the trial records indicate, the applicant’s lawyers requested the court to summon B. and K. in order to determine the exact circumstances of the search with a view to establishing whether the explosives had been planted on the applicant. The applicant in turn stated that she did “not insist” on their presence, since in her opinion the explosives had been planted by police officers already before she was searched. However, she had supported the motion because her lawyers considered B. and K.’s presence to be necessary (see paragraph 52 above).\n170: It is of significance that during the trial it was the prosecution which extensively questioned the police officers who had been involved in the applicant’s arrest, personal search and fingerprinting (see paragraph 42 above). All of the police officers testified that the applicant had been in possession of her handbag at all times prior to the search and that she had been fingerprinted only once after the search. For its part, the defence remained generally passive during the cross-examination of these witnesses and only put two questions to them aimed at exploring further the details of the above events.\n171: The Court notes that the defence gave little more than a brief indication of the relevance of B. and K.’s potential testimony. However it did not provide any particular factual or legal arguments and did not elaborate in concrete terms on how their testimony could reasonably be expected to strengthen the case for the defence. Nor did the defence elaborate on this in their appeal (see paragraph 63 above). Given that the applicant herself had stated that the explosives were planted prior to the arrival of the attesting witnesses (see paragraph 52 above), further reasons for the examination of these witnesses would have been required.\n172: The Court notes that the trial records do not mention the reasons given by the trial court for dismissing the defence’s motion to summon the attesting witnesses (see paragraph 52 above). However, the Supreme Court, sitting as an appeal court with the competence to review both facts and points of law, reasoned that the personal appearance of B. and K. had not been necessary since the applicant herself had claimed that the explosives had been planted in her bag before she was searched. It further noted that the defence had agreed to proceed to the closing arguments and had not raised any objections nor made any additional requests for the hearing of evidence (see paragraph 67 above).\n173: While the domestic courts did not dismiss the applicant’s motion as unsubstantiated or unreasoned, it is clear that the significance of the attesting witnesses’ possible testimony, as claimed by the defence, and from the perspective of the trial court, was only remotely relevant to the subject matter of the accusation.\n174: Having regard to the general passivity of the defence during the examination of the police officers about the events surrounding the alleged planting of explosives, and the absence of any specific legal or factual arguments as to the necessity of examining the attesting witnesses, the Court concludes that the Supreme Court provided sufficient reasons for the decision not to examine them at the trial. The reasons given were appropriate in the circumstances of the case and were commensurate, namely adequate in terms of their scope and level of detail, with the reasons advanced by the defence.\n175: The Court would stress that the applicant, assisted by two professional lawyers, was able to conduct her defence effectively, confront and examine witnesses testifying against her, comment without hindrance on the incriminating evidence, adduce evidence she considered relevant and to present her account of the events to the domestic courts. Her conviction for preparing an act of terrorism and inciting others to commit such an act was based on a considerable body of evidence against her including the statements of several prosecution witnesses, the material (an extremist note and photographs) seized from the applicant’s flat, forensic examination reports and the transcripts of the police surveillance videotapes.\n176: Having regard to these considerations, the Court concludes that the domestic courts’ decision not to examine B. and K. at trial did not undermine the overall fairness of the proceedings.\n177: Accordingly, the Court, being mindful of its role as explained above (see paragraph 149 above), finds that there has been no violation of the applicant’s rights under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention as regards witnesses B. and K."

(e.g., 001-88482, 001-187932, 001-88482). Valid citation formats: [001-88482] or [001-88482, 001-187932, 001-88482]. \n\n001-88482\n207: The Court observes that, should the trial court have considered it unnecessary to summon Mr I.P. and Mr M.A., it could have dismissed the second applicant’s requests to summon the two witnesses on his behalf. However, the trial court formally granted such requests and thus agreed that the statements of Mr I.P. and Mr M.A. could have been relevant. The Court therefore considers that the trial court was under an obligation to take effective measures to ensure the witnesses’ presence at the hearing by way of, at the very least, issuing summonses. Having failed to do so, the trial court did not comply with its duty to ensure the presence of witnesses on the second applicant’s behalf on the same conditions as that of the prosecution witnesses and thus breached the “equality of arms” principle.\n\n001-187932\n147: The Court has noted that a decision to call a defence witness at a certain point during the investigation or trial and the subsequent absence of that witness from trial is significant, but not in itself conclusive (compare Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, § 188, 13 July 2006, where the absence of the witness led to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention, and Andrey Zakharov v. Ukraine, no. 26581/06, §§ 61-62, 7 January 2016, where it did not). However, once the domestic courts have accepted, at least in principle, that the examination of a witness for the defence was relevant, they have an obligation to take “effective” measures to ensure the witness’ presence at the hearing by way of, at the very least, issuing a summons (see Polufakin and Chernyshev v. Russia, no. 30997/02, § 207, 25 September 2008) or by ordering the police to compel a witness to appear in court (see Pello, cited above, § 34).\n\n001-88482\n182: The applicants’ request to summon employees of the shop and the police officers had been dismissed because the trial court had had no information about those persons or their whereabouts. Moreover, the court had noted that in October 2001 those persons could hardly have remembered the events of 6 December 2000. Mr P. and Mr M.A. had been summoned to the hearing at the second applicant’s request, but failed to attend it. The applicants had complained about the absence of the above-mentioned witnesses in court in their respective appeals. The appeal court had found that the applicants’ guilt had been proven by other evidence and emphasised that the trial court had taken all requisite measures to ensure the victims’ and witnesses’ presence at the hearings.</s><s>[INST] You are an ECHR legal expert tasked to answer a question.\n\nAnswer the following question using the retrieved documents.

                "CASE OF DENISOV v. UKRAINE; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 76639/11) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Anatoliy Oleksiyovych Denisov (“the applicant”), on 8 December 201\n2: The applicant was represented by Ms J. Gavron and Mr A. Halban, lawyers practising in London. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna.\n3: The applicant alleged, in particular, that his dismissal from the position of president of a court of appeal had not been carried out in conformity with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and constituted an unlawful and disproportionate interference with his private life, contrary to Article 8 of the Convention.\n4: On 15 January 2014 the Government were given notice of the application.\n5: On 25 April 2017, after having consulted the parties, a Chamber of the Fifth Section of the Court, composed of Angelika Nußberger, President, Erik Møse, Ganna Yudkivska, André Potocki, Yonko Grozev, Carlo Ranzoni, Mārtiņš Mits, judges, and Milan Blaško, Deputy Section Registrar, decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber in the above case, neither of the parties having objected to such relinquishment (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72 of the Rules of Court).\n6: The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 26 §§ 4 and 5 of the Convention and Rule 24.\n7: The applicant and the Government each filed written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application. In addition, third-party comments were received from the International Commission of Jurists, which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 3).\n8: A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 18 October 2017.\n9: At the Court’s request, the applicant, in a letter of 24 November 2017, amended his claims for costs and expenses to take into account the proceedings before the Grand Chamber. The Government submitted their comments on his revised claims on 11 December 2017.\n10: The applicant was born on 6 July 1948 and lives in Kyiv.\n11: The applicant’s judicial career started in 1976, when he was first elected to the post of judge of a district court. During his judicial career the applicant held the position of president in several courts.\n12: On 22 December 2005 the applicant was elected to the post of judge of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal by the Ukrainian Parliament.\n13: On 10 November 2006 the applicant was appointed, by the President of Ukraine, as acting president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal. On 6 February 2009 he was appointed president of that court by the Council of Judges of Ukraine (a body of judicial self-governance). He was appointed for a five-year term, it being understood that he would reach the retirement age in July 2013, before the end of that term.\n14: In February 2011 the Council of Administrative Court Judges (another body of judicial self-governance) decided, among other issues, to review the functioning of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal. The review was carried out in February and March 2011 and concerned the years 2009 and 2010, as well as the period between January and February 2011.\n15: On 24 May 2011 the Council of Administrative Court Judges, chaired by Judge K., made a submission to the High Council of Justice (“the HCJ”) proposing the applicant’s dismissal from the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal for failure to perform his administrative duties properly. The proposal was based on the results of the aforementioned review.\n16: The HCJ scheduled hearings on 30 and 31 May 2011 and the applicant was invited to attend them. However, in view of information received from the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal on 27 May 2011 that the applicant was on annual leave until 8 July 2011, the HCJ adjourned the examination of the case. It sent the applicant a summons for the next hearing, which was scheduled on 14 June 2011. In reply, the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal informed the HCJ once again that the applicant was on holiday until 8 July 2011.\n17: On 14 June 2011 the HCJ examined the case in the applicant’s absence and decided to dismiss him from the post of president of the court, relying on section 20 of the Judiciary and Status of Judges Act and section 32-1 of the High Council of Justice Act. The HCJ noted that “significant shortcomings, omissions and errors, and grave violations of the foundations of the organisation and administration of justice set forth by law [had] been found in the organisation of the work of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal”. It stated that “the improper organisation of the court’s work was the result of the failure by the president of the court, Mr A. Denisov, to comply with the provisions of the applicable laws concerning the fulfilment of his administrative duties”. It also found that “administrative documents issued by Mr A. Denisov regarding the distribution of duties between the vice-presidents of the court, the setting-up of court chambers and panels and the distribution of cases among judges, as well as personnel-related and other documents in certain cases, [violated] the provisions of [the domestic legislation]”. It lastly stated that the applicant’s failures as president of the court involved a “lack of proper planning, control and effective use of human resources”.\n18: The decision was voted on by the HCJ, whose members present on that occasion included Judge K., the Prosecutor General and other judicial and non-judicial members. Out of the eighteen members present, eight were judges. Fourteen votes were cast in favour of the applicant’s dismissal.\n19: According to the applicant, the composition of the HCJ in his case included two members who on earlier occasions had initiated proceedings for his dismissal from the post of judge for an alleged “breach of oath”. Furthermore, the applicant alleged that the President of the HCJ and another member of the HCJ had previously communicated with him, attempting – albeit without success – to influence him in the course of his professional activities.\n20: On 17 June 2011 the President of the HCJ asked the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal to ensure that the HCJ’s decision on the applicant’s dismissal was executed and that information about its execution was provided to the HCJ immediately. On 23 June 2011 the applicant was dismissed from his administrative position, remaining in office as a judge of the same court.\n21: The applicant challenged the decision of the HCJ before the Higher Administrative Court (“the HAC”), arguing that the decision on his dismissal was unlawful and unfounded. In his claim the applicant submitted that the HCJ had failed to comply with the requirements of an independent and impartial tribunal. He emphasised that those requirements were part of the procedural safeguards provided for by Article 6 of the Convention, which was applicable to his case in its civil limb because the impugned decision had substantially affected his right to work and his professional dignity. The applicant further argued that his right to participate in the hearings had not been secured. He alleged that the decision of the HCJ was worded in general terms and that it did not refer to any specific facts or indicate a specific time when those facts had taken place. The applicant then asked the HAC to take into account the fact that his judicial career had exceeded thirty-five years, that he had held positions of president at several courts for twenty-five years, that he had been given awards for his judicial service and that during the initial period of his presidency of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal that court had moved from a demolished military barracks to premises in the city centre with proper equipment and a sufficient number of hearing rooms.\n22: The applicant also claimed compensation for the pecuniary damage caused by the ensuing reduction in his remuneration, which, at the date of the claim, had amounted to 4,034.33 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH)  in relation to the period which had elapsed in July and August 2011.\n23: On 25 August 2011 the HAC held a hearing in the presence of the applicant and decided to dismiss his claim in respect of pecuniary damage without considering it. The HAC adopted a decision to that effect, stating that it had no jurisdiction to determine that issue.\n24: On 11 October 2011 the HAC rejected the applicant’s claim concerning his dismissal from the administrative position as unsubstantiated. In its decision the HAC specified, in particular, that it had competence to review whether the impugned decision had been taken lawfully, reasonably, proportionately and, among other requirements, impartially. The HAC stated that the applicant had not contested the facts forming the grounds for his dismissal and therefore those facts had been taken as established. The HAC then reiterated the failings attributed to the applicant and concluded that the HCJ’s decision had been lawful and that the applicant’s right to participate in the proceedings in person had not been violated because the HCJ had taken all the necessary measures to inform him about the hearings and the applicant had not had any valid reason for being absent from the hearings. The HAC found that the HCJ had acted in accordance with the Constitution, the Judiciary and Status of Judges Act and the High Council of Justice Act. It had also complied with the Rules of the HCJ, which provided that one of the grounds for the dismissal of a judge from an administrative position was a “breach of official duties”. In conclusion, the HAC stated that the HCJ had not violated the Constitution or the laws of Ukraine.\n25: Following his dismissal from the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal, the applicant continued to work as a regular judge in the same court until 20 June 2013, when Parliament dismissed him from the post of judge after he had tendered a statement of resignation.\n26: The relevant provisions of the Constitution read as follows at the relevant time:\n27: The relevant provisions of the Code read as follows at the relevant time:\n28: Councils for the judiciary should demonstrate the highest degree of transparency towards judges and society by developing pre-established procedures and reasoned decisions.\n33: The relevant extracts from the European Charter on the statute for judges (Department of Legal Affairs of the Council of Europe, 8-10 July 1998, DAJ/DOC (98)23) read:\n34: In the conclusions to its “Report on the Independence of the Judicial System, Part I: The Independence of Judges”, adopted at its 82nd plenary session on 12 and 13 March 2010 (CDL-AD(2010)004), the Venice Commission found as follows:\n35: The relevant parts of Recommendation CM/Rec(2010)12 of the Committee of Ministers to member States on judges: independence, efficiency and responsibilities (adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 17 November 2010 at the 1098th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies) read as follows:\n36: The Consultative Council of European Judges, at its 11th plenary meeting (17-19 November 2010), adopted a Magna Carta of Judges (Fundamental Principles) summarising and codifying the main conclusions of the Opinions it had already adopted. The section entitled “Body in charge of guaranteeing independence” reads as follows:\n37: Further relevant international texts can be found in Baka v. Hungary [GC] (no. 20261/12, §§ 72-73 and 82-86, ECHR 2016).\n38: The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the proceedings before the HCJ and the HAC concerning his removal from the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal had not been compatible with the requirements of independence and impartiality. He complained, in addition, that the HAC had not provided a sufficient review of his case, thereby impairing his right of access to a court.\n39: The relevant part of Article 6 § 1 reads as follows:\n40: Relying on the principles developed in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007II), the applicant submitted that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention applied to his case under the civil limb. The national law did not expressly exclude access to court: his case had been examined by the HCJ performing a judicial function, and had subsequently been reviewed by the HAC, an ordinary court within the domestic judicial system. Therefore, the domestic law did not exclude access to a court for cases of this kind and the first limb of the test set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others was not satisfied. Furthermore, the applicant’s dismissal from his administrative position had caused him pecuniary loss, by way of a reduction in his salary, as well as non-pecuniary loss in view of his demotion in status. In his original application form the applicant submitted that Article 6 was also applicable under the “criminal” limb. However, in his submissions before the Grand Chamber he stated that the applicability of Article 6 was limited to its civil aspect.\n41: The Government submitted that the civil limb of Article 6 was not applicable since there was no “civil” right at issue. The dispute had been entirely within the sphere of public law and the claim submitted by the applicant in respect of pecuniary damage concerned a small amount (see paragraph 22 above), which had not constituted a significant disadvantage for him. On those grounds the Government submitted that the complaint was incompatible ratione materiae with the Convention.\n42: The third party, the International Commission of Jurists, submitted that the principle of independence of the judiciary necessarily implied security of tenure in the office of court president. In order to ensure such security of tenure and to maintain both the independence of individual court presidents and their capacity to uphold the independence of judges in their courts, proceedings for removal from the position of court president had to provide the same guarantees of independence and fairness as those for removal from the office of judge. The third party contended that the applicability of Article 6 in the present case had to be determined on the basis of the Vilho Eskelinen test, which had been applied by the Court in cases concerning judges including Baka (cited above).\n43: It is common ground between the parties that Article 6 § 1 is not applicable under its criminal limb. Indeed, the proceedings at issue did not relate to the determination of a criminal charge, and for this reason the criminal limb does not apply (see, mutatis mutandis, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, §§ 93-95).\n44: For Article 6 § 1 in its “civil” limb to be applicable, there must be a “dispute” regarding a “right” which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law, irrespective of whether it is protected under the Convention. The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, among many other authorities, Boulois v. Luxembourg [GC], no. 37575/04, § 90, ECHR 2012; Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no. 22251/08, § 42, ECHR 2015; Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v. Romania [GC], no. 76943/11, § 71, ECHR 2016; and Regner v. the Czech Republic GC, no. 35289/11, § 99, ECHR 2017).\n45: Article 6 § 1 does not guarantee any particular content for (civil) “rights and obligations” in the substantive law of the Contracting States: the Court may not create by way of interpretation of Article 6 § 1 a substantive right which has no legal basis in the State concerned (see, for example, Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, § 117, ECHR 2005X). The starting-point must be the provisions of the relevant domestic law and their interpretation by the domestic courts (ibid., § 120; see also Károly Nagy v. Hungary [GC], no. 56665/09, § 62, ECHR 2017, and Regner, cited above, § 100). The Court would need strong reasons to differ from the conclusions reached by the superior national courts by finding, contrary to their view, that there was arguably a right recognised by domestic law (see Károly Nagy, cited above, § 62).\n46: The authority taking decisions on the selection and career of judges should be independent of the executive and legislative powers. With a view to guaranteeing its independence, at least half of the members of the authority should be judges chosen by their peers.\n47: However, where the constitutional or other legal provisions prescribe that the head of state, the government or the legislative power take decisions concerning the selection and career of judges, an independent and competent authority drawn in substantial part from the judiciary (without prejudice to the rules applicable to councils for the judiciary contained in Chapter IV) should be authorised to make recommendations or express opinions which the relevant appointing authority follows in practice.\n48: The membership of the independent authorities referred to in paragraphs 46 and 47 should ensure the widest possible representation. Their procedures should be transparent with reasons for decisions being made available to applicants on request. ...\n49: Lastly, the dispute was “directly decisive” for the right at issue because it resulted in the premature termination of the applicant’s exercise of that right.\n50: The Government contested the applicability of Article 6, arguing that the dispute was in the area of public law and that, consequently, there was no “civil” right at issue.\n51: In this connection it has to be noted that the scope of the “civil” concept in Article 6 is not limited by the immediate subject matter of the dispute. Instead, the Court has developed a wider approach, according to which the “civil” limb has covered cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private pecuniary or non-pecuniary right belonging to an individual. Through this approach, the civil limb of Article 6 has been applied to a variety of disputes which may have been classified in domestic law as public-law disputes. These examples include disciplinary proceedings concerning the right to practise a profession (see Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 23 June 1981, §§ 47 and 48, Series A no. 43, and Philis v. Greece (no. 2), 27 June 1997, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV), disputes involving the right to a healthy environment (see Taşkın and Others v. Turkey, no. 46117/99, § 133, ECHR 2004X), prisoners’ detention arrangements (see Ganci v. Italy, no. 41576/98, § 25, ECHR 2003XI, and Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, § 103, ECHR 2009), the right of access to investigation documents (see Savitskyy v. Ukraine, no. 38773/05, §§ 143-45, 26 July 2012), disputes regarding the non-inclusion of a conviction in a criminal record (see Alexandre v. Portugal, no. 33197/09, §§ 54 and 55, 20 November 2012), proceedings for the application of a non-custodial preventive measure (see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, § 154, ECHR 2017 (extracts)), and the revocation of a civil servant’s security clearance within the Ministry of Defence (see Regner, cited above, §§ 113-27).\n52: Besides the above-mentioned development of the case-law, the scope of the “civil” limb has been substantially extended in relation to public-employment disputes, a field which is directly relevant to the present case. In Vilho Eskelinen and Others (cited above) the Court, having regard to the existing state of affairs in the Contracting States and in view of non-discrimination considerations in relation to civil servants as compared to private employees, established a presumption that Article 6 applied to “ordinary labour disputes” between a civil servant and the State and that it would be for the respondent Government to show that a civil servant did not have a right of access to a court under national law and that this exclusion of the rights under Article 6 was justified (ibid., § 62). On the basis of the principles set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, Article 6 has been applied to employment disputes involving judges who were dismissed from judicial office (see, for example, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, §§ 91 and 96; Kulykov and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 5114/09 and 17 others, §§ 118 and 132, 19 January 2017; Sturua v. Georgia, no. 45729/05, § 27, 28 March 2017; and Kamenos v. Cyprus, no. 147/07, § 88, 31 October 2017), removed from an administrative position without the termination of their duties as a judge (see Baka, cited above, §§ 34 and 107-11) or suspended from judicial office (see Paluda v. Slovakia, no. 33392/12, § 34, 23 May 2017). It has also been applied to employment disputes involving civil servants who had lost a remote-area allowance which had been added to their salaries as a bonus (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, §§ 40 and 41) or who had been transferred to another office or post against their will, resulting in a decrease in salary (see Zalli v. Albania, no. 52531/07, 8 February 2011, and Ohneberg v. Austria, no. 10781/08, 18 September 2012). Furthermore, in Bayer v. Germany (no. 8453/04, 16 July 2009), which concerned the removal from office of a State-employed bailiff following disciplinary proceedings, the Court held that disputes about “salaries, allowances or similar entitlements” were only non-exhaustive examples of “ordinary labour disputes” to which Article 6 should in principle apply under the Vilho Eskelinen test (ibid., § 38; see also Regner, cited above, § 108).\n53: In the light of the above principles, the Government’s argument that the civil limb of Article 6 § 1 is not applicable for the sole reason that the applicant’s dispute falls within the field of public law and there is no “civil” right at stake is not convincing. As shown above, a public-law dispute may bring the civil limb into play if the private-law aspects predominate over the public-law ones in view of the direct consequences for a civil pecuniary or non-pecuniary right. Furthermore, the Court follows the criteria set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others and applies a general presumption that such direct consequences for civil rights exist in “ordinary labour disputes” involving members of the public service, including judges (ibid., § 62 and Baka, cited above, § 104).\n54: Indeed, the present case concerned an “ordinary labour dispute” given that it essentially affected (i) the scope of the work which the applicant was required to perform as an employee and (ii) his remuneration as part of his employment relationship (compare Ohneberg, cited above, § 25). Having regard to these two aspects, there is no reason to conclude that there was no “civil” element in the applicant’s dispute or that such an element was insufficiently significant to bring the “civil” limb of Article 6 into play.\n55: Applying the Vilho Eskelinen test further, it is not disputed that domestic law provides for access to a court in the case of claims concerning dismissal from administrative positions in the judiciary. Accordingly, Article 6 applies under its civil head.\n56: It follows that the Government’s preliminary objection as to the applicability of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention must be dismissed.\n57: The Court further notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n58: The applicant submitted that the HCJ did not constitute an “independent and impartial tribunal” owing to the manner of its composition, the subordination of its members to other State bodies and the lack of objective impartiality and the existence of personal bias on the part of some of its members. Furthermore, the obligation to provide an “independent and impartial tribunal” had not been satisfied by the HAC either.\n59: The Government submitted that the requirements of Article 6 § 1 had been met and that there was no indication of bias on the part of the national authorities. They emphasised that the HAC’s judgment had been based on the parties’ submissions and had included sufficient reasons.\n60: In determining whether a body could be considered “independent”in particular, from the executive and the parties to the casethe Court has in previous cases had regard to such factors as the manner of appointment of the body’s members, the duration of their term of office, the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence (see Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 49, ECHR 2013 (extracts), with further references therein).\n61: As a rule, impartiality denotes the absence of prejudice or bias. According to the Court’s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to (i) a subjective test, where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge – that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and (ii) an objective test, that is to say, by ascertaining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of any of its members, the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, among other authorities, Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 93, ECHR 2009, with further references).\n62: However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality, as the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to the tribunal’s impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (the objective test) but may also go to the issue of the judges’ personal conviction (the subjective test) (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge’s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996III).\n63: In this respect, even appearances may be of a certain importance, or in other words, “justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done”. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (see Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 78, ECHR 2015).\n64: Finally, the concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked and, depending on the circumstances, may require joint examination (see, for example, Cooper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48843/99, § 104, ECHR 2003XII).\n65: According to the Court’s case-law, even where an adjudicatory body determining disputes over “civil rights and obligations” does not comply with Article 6 § 1 in some respect, no violation of the Convention can be found if the proceedings before that body are “subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of Article 6 § 1” (see Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium, 10 February 1983, § 29, Series A no. 58, and Tsfayo v. the United Kingdom, no. 60860/00, § 42, 14 November 2006).\n66: The issue of the applicant’s performance in the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal was initially raised by the Council of Administrative Court Judges, which, having conducted its inquiry, decided to submit a proposal to the HCJ for the applicant’s dismissal from his administrative position. The issue was then examined by the HCJ, which was not bound by the initial proposal from the Council of Administrative Court Judges. On the contrary, the HCJ was empowered to carry out its own assessment of the facts, provide its own legal characterisation of the matter and adopt a binding decision after holding a hearing and assessing the evidence. In the present case the examination of the issue by the HCJ ended with a decision to dismiss the applicant and that decision was executed shortly after its adoption (see paragraph 20 above). Subsequently, following its execution, the decision of the HCJ was reviewed by the HAC.\n67: The above-mentioned features of the domestic proceedings suggest that the Council of Administrative Court Judges played a preliminary investigative role in the case. This part of the case is not being challenged by the applicant, who focuses his complaint on the alleged unfairness of the proceedings before the HCJ and the HAC and the lack of a “sufficient review” by the latter. In these circumstances the Court must examine whether the HCJ and the HAC satisfied the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. However, if the HCJ did not meet those requirements, an issue under Article 6 would arise only if the HAC failed to provide a “sufficient review” in compliance with Article 6 (compare Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere, cited above, §§ 51 and 54, and Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, §§ 108, 123 and 130). Accordingly, in the present case the Court is called upon to examine firstly whether the requirements of an “independent and impartial tribunal” were complied with by the HCJ. Secondly, if those requirements were not satisfied at that stage, it is necessary to determine whether the review of the case by the HAC was “sufficient” to remedy the shortcomings identified. Thirdly, it has to be established whether the HAC itself complied with the requirements of independence and impartiality.\n68: In its Oleksandr Volkov judgment (cited above) the Court set out a number of criteria for examining whether the HCJ as a disciplinary body of judges complied with the requirements of independence and impartiality. In doing so, the Court relied on its previous case-law and took into account relevant international texts, notably the opinions and recommendations of other bodies of the Council of Europe. First, it emphasised the need for substantial representation of judges within such a body, specifying that where at least half of the membership of a tribunal was composed of judges, including the chairman with a casting vote, this would be a strong indicator of impartiality (ibid., § 109). Second, in view of the importance of reducing the influence of political organs on the composition of the disciplinary body, it was relevant to assess the manner in which judges were appointed to that body, having regard to the authorities which delegated them and the role of the judicial community in that process (ibid., § 112). Third, it was relevant to establish whether the members of the disciplinary body worked on a full-time basis or continued to work and receive a salary outside; given that the latter case would inevitably involve their material, hierarchical and administrative dependence on their primary employers, this would endanger their independence and impartiality (ibid., § 113). Fourth, attention had to be paid to the participation of representatives of the prosecution authorities in the composition of the disciplinary body for judges; the inclusion of the Prosecutor General ex officio and the other members delegated by the prosecution authorities raised concerns as to the impartiality of the disciplinary body of judges in view of the functional role of prosecutors in domestic judicial proceedings (ibid., § 114). Fifth, where the members of the disciplinary body played a role in the preliminary inquiry in a disciplinary case and subsequently participated in the determination of the same case by the disciplinary body, such a duplication of functions could cast objective doubt on the impartiality of those members (ibid., § 115).\n69: Disciplinary proceedings may follow where judges fail to carry out their duties in an efficient and proper manner. Such proceedings should be conducted by an independent authority or a court with all the guarantees of a fair trial and provide the judge with the right to challenge the decision and sanction. Disciplinary sanctions should be proportionate.”\n70: Those findings are entirely pertinent to the present application. The HCJ was formed and functioned under the same constitutional rules as in Oleksandr Volkov. Therefore, the same concerns arise as regards the compliance of the proceedings before the HCJ with the standards of independence and impartiality. The applicant’s case was heard and determined by eighteen members of the HCJ, of whom only eight were judges. The non-judicial members therefore constituted a majority capable of determining the outcome of the proceedings. Moreover, there remained issues both with the manner in which the judicial members were delegated to the HCJ by the executive and legislative authorities, limiting the number of judges in the HCJ elected by their peers, and also with the fact that the majority of the HCJ’s members were not employed there full time and that the Prosecutor General was a member.\n71: Furthermore, as regards the applicant’s allegations, set out in detail before the Court, that certain members of the HCJ had shown personal bias in his case, it cannot be overlooked that Judge K., who was a member of the HCJ, had initially, in his capacity as chairman of the Council of Administrative Court Judges, played a role in the preliminary inquiry of the applicant’s case and in making the proposal to the HCJ for his dismissal (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above). This preliminary involvement cast objective doubt on Judge K.’s impartiality when he subsequently took part in the decision of the HCJ on the merits of the applicant’s case (compare Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 115; Poposki and Duma v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 69916/10 and 36531/11, § 48, 7 January 2016; and Sturua, cited above, § 35).\n72: The above considerations are sufficient for the Court to conclude that the proceedings before the HCJ lacked the guarantees of independence and impartiality in view of the structural deficiencies and the appearance of personal bias.\n73: In order to determine firstly whether a second-level tribunal had “full jurisdiction”, or provided “sufficiency of review” to remedy a lack of independence and impartiality at first instance, the Court has considered that it is necessary to have regard to such factors as the subject matter of the decision appealed against, the manner in which that decision was arrived at and the content of the dispute, including the desired and actual grounds of appeal (see Bryan v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 44-47, Series A no. 335A, and Tsfayo, cited above, § 43).\n74: In Oleksandr Volkov the Court specifically found that the HAC had not provided a sufficient review of a case concerning a judge’s dismissal from office. Firstly, the Court observed that the HAC had powers to declare the impugned decisions unlawful, but that it was unable to quash them and take any further appropriate steps if deemed necessary. Even though no legal consequences arose from a decision being declared unlawful, the HAC’s inability to quash the impugned decision, together with the absence of rules as to the further progress of the disciplinary proceedings (in particular, the steps that had to be taken by the authorities involved after the impugned decisions had been declared unlawful and the time-limits for those steps to be taken), produced serious uncertainty about the real legal consequences of such judicial declarations. Judicial practice suggested, moreover, that there was no automatic reinstatement in the event of a positive declaration by the HAC, because the judges concerned had to institute new proceedings for reinstatement (ibid., §§ 125 and 126). The Court also examined the manner and the actual scope of the HAC’s review and concluded that these were likewise inappropriate to provide a “sufficient review” (ibid., §§ 127 and 128).\n75: The above considerations are equally pertinent to the present case. In reviewing the HCJ’s decision, which had immediate effect, the HAC was acting within the same legal framework with the same limited powers and uncertainties as to the eventual legal consequences.\n76: Moreover, looking into the content of the dispute at stake in the present case, there are serious mismatches between the advanced and actual grounds of review. Firstly, in its decision the HAC considered that the applicant had not contested the facts forming the grounds for his dismissal and therefore those facts were taken as established. This conclusion is not consistent with the grounds of the applicant’s claim before the HAC, in which he clearly contested those facts. The applicant argued in particular that the findings of the HCJ were too general and that in order to substantiate its conclusions the HCJ should have referred to the specific circumstances and their time frame.\n77: Secondly, the HAC made no genuine attempt to examine another important argument by the applicant alleging a lack of independence and impartiality in the proceedings before the HCJ (see paragraph 21 above). Having mentioned its competence to review whether the impugned decision had been taken in a manner compatible with a number of criteria, notably the requirement of impartiality, the HAC reached a general conclusion that the HCJ had not violated the Constitution or the laws of Ukraine. However, the HAC failed to assess whether the proceedings before the HCJ had complied with the principles of independence and impartiality. It provided no reasons in that regard.\n78: Therefore, the review of the applicant’s case by the HAC was not sufficient. Accordingly, it was unable to remedy the defects regarding procedural fairness resulting from the proceedings before the HCJ.\n79: As to the guarantees of independence and impartiality under Article 6 § 1 to be provided by the reviewing judicial body, such a review was performed in the present case by the judges of the HAC, who were also under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the HCJ. This means that those judges could also be the subject of disciplinary proceedings before the HCJ. The fact that judges of the HAC were subject to disciplinary law and were bound by rules of judicial discipline and ethics is not in itself a reason to put in doubt their independence and impartiality in relation to the authority empowered to implement disciplinary rules. The question of compliance with the fundamental guarantees of independence and impartiality may arise, however, if the structure and functioning of the disciplinary body raises serious issues in this regard. The present case does indeed disclose serious issues of this kind on the part of the HCJ, in particular structural deficiencies and the appearance of personal bias (see paragraphs 70-72 above). Secondly, the HCJ was not merely a disciplinary authority; it was in reality an authority with extensive powers with respect to the careers of judges (appointment, disciplining and dismissal). On the basis of those factors and having regard to the specific context of the Ukrainian system at the time, the Court, in the light of Oleksandr Volkov (cited above, § 130), finds that the judges of the HAC considering the applicant’s case, in which the HCJ participated, were not able to demonstrate the “independence and impartiality” required by Article 6 of the Convention.\n80: It follows that the judicial review by the HAC in the present case did not comply with the requirement of independence and impartiality.\n81: Accordingly, the HCJ failed to ensure an independent and impartial examination of the applicant’s case, and the subsequent review of his case by the HAC did not put those defects right.\n82: There has therefore been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n83: The applicant complained under Article 8 of the Convention that his right to respect for his private life had been violated by his dismissal from the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal.\n84: The relevant parts of Article 8 of the Convention provide as follows:\n85: The applicant submitted that his right to respect for his private life was engaged because his career, reputation and social and professional relationships had been irreparably damaged. Furthermore, his material well-being had been affected given the reduction in his salary and in the prospective pension benefits. In support of his contention, the applicant relied on Erményi v. Hungary (no. 22254/14, §§ 30 and 31, 22 November 2016), in which the termination of the applicant’s mandate as VicePresident of the Supreme Court was found to have interfered with his right to respect for his private life.\n86: As regards reputation, the applicant argued that the position of president of a court of appeal was prestigious and powerful. As he had occupied positions as president of several courts over a period of twenty-five years, the position from which he had been dismissed represented the apex of his legal career and the culmination of decades of personal dedication and professional commitment. His dismissal from that position had damaged his peers’ perceptions of his personal authority and competence. Furthermore, the reason for his dismissal, namely breaches of laws relating to the organisation of the justice process, had affected his professional standing generally and his future career and promotion prospects. This was particularly relevant in view of the fact that the information about his dismissal had been widely disseminated. In the context of his allegation of serious damage to his reputation, the applicant contended that the interests of his children as trained lawyers had been affected by his wrongful dismissal.\n87: The applicant further submitted, as to the merits of his complaint, that the interference with his right to respect for his private life had not been “in accordance with the law” as the applicable law was too vague and did not provide for procedural safeguards to prevent its arbitrary application. He then submitted that his dismissal had been disproportionate in the circumstances as the manner in which he had been dismissed had not given him any opportunity to remedy his alleged managerial failings.\n88: The Government submitted that the right to exercise administrative functions in a court did not fall within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention. In contrast to the cases of Oleksandr Volkov (cited above) and Özpınar v. Turkey (no. 20999/04, 19 October 2010), the applicant in the present case had not been removed from judicial office. Given this important distinction, the complaint was incompatible ratione materiae with the Convention.\n89: The Government further contended that even assuming that Article 8 was applicable, the applicant’s removal from his administrative position had had very little impact on his private life. The applicant had probably changed office in the same court building and had received a slightly lower salary. Therefore, he had not suffered a “significant disadvantage” and the complaint had to be declared inadmissible under Article 35 §§ 3 (b) and 4 of the Convention.\n90: As to the merits, the Government submitted that, unlike in the case of Oleksandr Volkov, the applicable domestic law had been sufficiently clear and foreseeable as to its application; the interference had pursued the legitimate aims of public safety, the economic well-being of the country, the prevention of disorder or crime and the protection of the rights of others. They submitted that the applicant’s operational failings had threatened the proper administration of justice in the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal, which covered several regions of the country. The interference had been necessary in the circumstances in order to achieve the above-mentioned legitimate aims.\n91: The third party submitted that the issue of the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention had to be determined with regard to the fact that the position of court president always implied a leadership role in the judiciary and that removal from that position engaged the individual’s private life. In particular, such removal affected the professional relationships of the individual concerned, as well as his reputation and standing.\n92: The Court notes that the present case concerns an employment-related dispute between an individual and a State. The decision to dismiss the applicant was taken by a State authority. In the assessment of whether or not a private-life issue under Article 8 of the Convention is raised in such a case, there is a strong tie between the questions of applicability and the merits. Once a measure is found to have seriously affected the applicant’s private life, that conclusion means that the complaint is compatible ratione materiae with the Convention and, at the same time, that the measure constituted an “interference” with the “right to respect for private life” for the purpose of the three-limb merits test under Article 8 (assessment of the lawfulness, the legitimate aim and the necessity of such “interference”). Therefore, the questions of applicability and the existence of “interference” are inextricably linked in these categories of complaints.\n93: In previous cases the Court has taken up this matter either at the stage of admissibility (see, for example, Bigaeva v. Greece, no. 26713/05, §§ 22-25, 28 May 2009; Gillberg v. Sweden [GC], no. 41723/06, §§ 64-74, 3 April 2012; and Fernández Martínez v. Spain [GC], no. 56030/07, §§ 10913, ECHR 2014 (extracts)) or at the stage of the merits (see Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, §§ 42-50, ECHR 2004VIII; Campagnano v. Italy, no. 77955/01, §§ 53 and 54, ECHR 2006IV; Özpınar, cited above, §§ 43-48; Sodan v. Turkey, no. 18650/05, §§ 43-50, 2 February 2016; and Şahin Kuş v. Turkey, no. 33160/04, §§ 3437, 7 June 2016). This divergent practice cannot be justified in terms of consistency. As the question of applicability is an issue of the Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae, the general rule of dealing with applications should be respected and the relevant analysis should be carried out at the admissibility stage unless there is a particular reason to join this question to the merits. No such particular reason exists in the present case and the issue of the applicability of Article 8 falls to be examined at the admissibility stage.\n94: The Court therefore has to examine whether Article 8 of the Convention is applicable to the present case, and accordingly whether it has jurisdiction ratione materiae to examine the relevant complaint on the merits.\n95: The concept of “private life” is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person. It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person’s physical and social identity. Article 8 protects in addition a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 66, ECHR 2008; Gillberg, cited above, § 66; and Bărbulescu v. Romania [GC], no. 61496/08, § 70, ECHR 2017 (extracts), with further references therein).\n96: Therefore, it would be too restrictive to limit the notion of “private life” to an “inner circle” in which the individual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle (see Fernández Martínez, cited above, § 109).\n97: Alongside this development in the case-law, the Court has been called upon to determine whether the notion of “private life” should cover a right to respect for reputation, which is not expressly mentioned in Article 8. In Pfeifer v. Austria (no. 12556/03, § 35, 15 November 2007) the Court, having regard to its case-law, found that a person’s reputation, even if that person was criticised in the context of a public debate, formed part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore also fell within the scope of his or her “private life”.\n98: However, it is important to stress that Article 8 cannot be relied on in order to complain of a loss of reputation which is the foreseeable consequence of one’s own actions, such as, for example, the commission of a criminal offence (see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, § 49, and Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, § 83, 7 February 2012). In Gillberg (cited above) the Grand Chamber did not limit this rule to reputational damage and expanded it to a wider principle that any personal, social, psychological and economic suffering could be foreseeable consequences of the commission of a criminal offence and could not therefore be relied on in order to complain that a criminal conviction in itself amounted to an interference with the right to respect for “private life” (ibid., § 68). This extended principle should cover not only criminal offences but also other misconduct entailing a measure of legal responsibility with foreseeable negative effects on “private life”.\n99: On the basis of this case-law, the Court has applied Article 8 to the exercise of professional functions in a number of cases.\n100: Whereas no general right to employment, nor a right of access to the civil service or a right to choose a particular profession, can be derived from Article 8, the notion of “private life”, as a broad term, does not exclude in principle activities of a professional or business nature. It is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant opportunity to develop relationships with the outside world (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, § 29, Series A no. 251B; Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 165; and Bărbulescu, cited above, § 71). Professional life is therefore part of the zone of interaction between a person and others which, even in a public context, may, under certain circumstances, fall within the scope of “private life” (see Fernández Martínez, cited above, § 110).\n101: Within the employment-related scenarios involving Article 8, the Court has dealt with different types of cases. In particular, it has dealt with discharge from military service (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, ECHR 1999VI), dismissal from judicial office (see Özpınar, cited above; Oleksandr Volkov, cited above; and Kulykov and Others, cited above), removal from administrative functions in the judiciary (see Erményi, cited above), and transfers between posts in the public service (see Sodan, cited above). Other types of cases have concerned restrictions on access to employment in the public service (see Naidin v. Romania, no. 38162/07, 21 October 2014), loss of employment outside the public service (see Obst v. Germany, no. 425/03, 23 September 2010; Schüth v. Germany, no. 1620/03, ECHR 2010; Fernández Martínez, cited above; Şahin Kuş, cited above; and Bărbulescu, cited above), and restrictions on access to a profession in the private sector (see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above; Campagnano, cited above; and Bigaeva, cited above).\n102: In the cases falling into the above-mentioned category, the Court applies the concept of “private life” on the basis of two different approaches: (α) identification of the “private life” issue as the reason for the dispute (reason-based approach) and (β) deriving the “private life” issue from the consequences of the impugned measure (consequence-based approach).\n103: Complaints concerning the exercise of professional functions have been found to fall within the ambit of “private life” when factors relating to private life were regarded as qualifying criteria for the function in question and when the impugned measure was based on reasons encroaching upon the individual’s freedom of choice in the sphere of private life.\n104: Thus, in the area of public service, where measures taken by State authorities were contested, the Court has found, for example, that investigations by the military police into the applicants’ homosexuality and their consequent administrative discharge on the sole ground of their sexual orientation directly interfered with their right to respect for private life (see Smith and Grady, cited above, § 71). In Özpınar (cited above), proceedings for the applicant’s dismissal as a judge fell under Article 8 of the Convention because they concerned not only her professional performance but also targeted aspects of her private life, in particular her close private relationships, the clothes and make-up she wore and the fact that she lived separately from her mother (ibid., §§ 43 and 47). In another case the applicant’s transfer to a less important post within the public service raised an issue under “private life” given that such a measure amounted to a disguised penalty and had been prompted by reasons relating to the applicant’s beliefs and his wife’s clothing (see Sodan, cited above, §§ 47-49).\n105: The Court has applied similar logic from the standpoint of the positive obligations to carry out a careful balancing exercise between the private interests of employees and those of a non-governmental employer when the reasons for the dismissal related directly to the applicants’ conduct in their private life, such as an extramarital relationship (see Obst, cited above, §§ 43 et seq.) or living with a new partner after separation (see Schüth, cited above, §§ 57 et seq.). Where a private company dismissed an employee on the basis of monitoring of his correspondence by his employer in the workplace, such a measure fell within the ambit of Article 8 in so far as it concerned the “correspondence” and because it encroached upon the reasonable possibility of enjoying any “private life” in the workplace (see Bărbulescu, cited above, §§ 81 and 127).\n106: As can be seen from these examples, the underlying reasons for the impugned measure affecting professional life may be linked to the individual’s private life and these reasons themselves may render Article 8 applicable.\n107: When the reasons for imposing a measure affecting an individual’s professional life are not linked to the individual’s private life, an issue under Article 8 may still arise in so far as the impugned measure has or may have serious negative effects on the individual’s private life. In this connection the Court has taken into account negative consequences as regards (i) impact on the individual’s “inner circle”, in particular where there are serious material consequences, (ii) the individual’s opportunities “to establish and develop relationships with others”, and (iii) the impact on the individual’s reputation.\n108: On the basis of that approach, the Court has found that the dismissal of a judge on the grounds of a violation of his professional duties amounting to a breach of the judicial oath affected a wide range of his professional and other relationships. The dismissal also had a negative impact on the applicant’s “inner circle” in view of his loss of earnings, and it also affected his reputation (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 166). The refusal to allow an applicant who was a foreigner to sit for the Bar examinations in Greece fell within the scope of Article 8 because it affected her personal choice as to the way she wished to pursue her professional and private life (see Bigaeva, cited above, §§ 24 and 25). The entry of an applicant’s name in the bankruptcy register entailed a series of legal restrictions on the exercise of her professional activities and civil rights. It therefore affected the applicant’s opportunities to develop relationships with the outside world and fell within the sphere of her private life (see Campagnano, cited above, § 54). A far-reaching ban on taking up private-sector employment has also been found to affect “private life” (see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, § 47).\n109: Where no reason-based approach justifies the applicability of Article 8, an analysis of the effects of the impugned measure on the above-mentioned aspects of private life is necessary to conclude that the complaint falls within the scope of “private life”. Nevertheless, this division does not preclude cases in which the Court may find it appropriate to employ both approaches in combination, examining whether there is a private-life issue in the underpinning reasons for the impugned measure and, in addition, analysing the consequences of the measure (see Fernández Martínez, cited above, §§ 110-12).\n110: In cases where the Court employs the consequence-based approach, the analysis of the seriousness of the impugned measure’s effects occupies an important place. The Court has addressed the issue of the seriousness or severity of the alleged violation in several contexts. Notably, it has done so when assessing the “significant disadvantage” under Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention as an explicit admissibility requirement for the whole system of the Convention rights (see, for example, Giusti v. Italy, no. 13175/03, § 34, 18 October 2011; Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy, no. 23563/07, § 56, ECHR 2012 (extracts); and El Kaada v. Germany, no. 2130/10, § 41, 12 November 2015). The Court has also consistently applied a threshold of severity in cases concerning Article 3 of the Convention (see, for example, Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, § 67, ECHR 2006IX; Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 88, ECHR 2010; and Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, § 86, ECHR 2015).\n111: The concept of threshold of severity has been specifically examined under Article 8. In environmental cases, in particular, an arguable claim under Article 8 may arise where an environmental hazard attains a level of severity resulting in significant impairment of the applicant’s ability to enjoy his or her home or private or family life. The Court has ruled that the assessment of this minimum level in such cases is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance and its physical or mental effects on the individual’s health or quality of life (see Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, §§ 68 and 69, ECHR 2005IV; Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine, no. 30499/03, § 105, 10 February 2011; and Grimkovskaya v. Ukraine, no. 38182/03, § 58, 21 July 2011). This approach has also been applied in nuisance cases under Article 8 with close similarities to the environmental cases mentioned above (see Borysiewicz v. Poland, no. 71146/01, § 51, 1 July 2008, and Udovičić v. Croatia, no. 27310/09, § 137, 24 April 2014).\n112: In addition, the Court has ruled that an attack on a person’s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see A. v. Norway, no. 28070/06, §§ 63-64, 9 April 2009; Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain, no. 34147/06, §§ 40 and 44, 21 September 2010; Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 83; Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 137, ECHR 2015; and Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 72, ECHR 2016). This requirement covers social reputation in general as well as professional reputation in particular (for the latter, see Medžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 17224/11, §§ 76 and 105-06, ECHR 2017).\n113: In the recent case of Erményi the Court found that the applicant’s dismissal from the administrative position of Vice-President of the Supreme Court constituted an interference with his right to respect for private life (see Erményi, cited above, § 31). Even though the Court did not elaborate on this point, in the absence of the parties’ submissions in that regard, it implied that the impugned measure had seriously affected the applicant’s private life. That finding cannot be read as presuming that the applicant’s dismissal had “automatically” generated an issue in the sphere of private life. In that regard the Court reiterates that the threshold of severity occupies an important place in cases where the existence of a private-life issue is examined according to the consequence-based approach.\n114: It is thus an intrinsic feature of the consequence-based approach within Article 8 that convincing evidence showing that the threshold of severity was attained has to be submitted by the applicant. As the Grand Chamber has held, applicants are obliged to identify and explain the concrete repercussions on their private life and the nature and extent of their suffering, and to substantiate such allegations in a proper way (see Gillberg, cited above, §§ 70-73). According to the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies, such allegations have to be sufficiently raised at the domestic level.\n115: The Court concludes from the above case-law that employment-related disputes are not per se excluded from the scope of “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. There are some typical aspects of private life which may be affected in such disputes by dismissal, demotion, non-admission to a profession or other similarly unfavourable measures. These aspects include (i) the applicant’s “inner circle”, (ii) the applicant’s opportunity to establish and develop relationships with others, and (iii) the applicant’s social and professional reputation. There are two ways in which a private-life issue would usually arise in such a dispute: either because of the underlying reasons for the impugned measure (in that event the Court employs the reason-based approach) or – in certain cases – because of the consequences for private life (in that event the Court employs the consequence-based approach).\n116: If the consequence-based approach is at stake, the threshold of severity with respect to all the above-mentioned aspects assumes crucial importance. It is for the applicant to show convincingly that the threshold was attained in his or her case. The applicant has to present evidence substantiating consequences of the impugned measure. The Court will only accept that Article 8 is applicable where these consequences are very serious and affect his or her private life to a very significant degree.\n117: The Court has established criteria for assessing the severity or seriousness of alleged violations in different regulatory contexts. An applicant’s suffering is to be assessed by comparing his or her life before and after the measure in question. The Court further considers that in determining the seriousness of the consequences in employment-related cases it is appropriate to assess the subjective perceptions claimed by the applicant against the background of the objective circumstances existing in the particular case. This analysis would have to cover both the material and the non-material impact of the alleged measure. However, it remains for the applicant to define and substantiate the nature and extent of his or her suffering, which should have a causal connection with the impugned measure. Having regard to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, the essential elements of such allegations must be sufficiently raised before the domestic authorities dealing with the matter.\n118: In the present case the Court is required to answer the question whether the applicant’s dismissal from the position of president of a court of appeal, without his removal from the post of judge, affected his private life, thus rendering Article 8 applicable.\n119: The Court will first examine the way in which a private-life issue could arise in the present employment dispute: whether because of the underlying reasons for the applicant’s dismissal or because of the consequences for his private life.\n120: The explicit reasons for the applicant’s dismissal from the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal were strictly limited to his performance in the public arena, namely his alleged managerial failings, which were said to undermine the proper functioning of the court. Those reasons related only to the applicant’s administrative tasks in the workplace and had no connection to his private life. In the absence of any such issues in the reasons given for his dismissal, it has to be determined whether, according to the evidence and the substantiated allegations put forward by the applicant, the measure had serious negative consequences for the aspects constituting his “private life”, namely (i) his “inner circle”, (ii) his opportunities to establish and develop relationships with others, or (iii) his reputation.\n121: When it comes to the consequences of the applicant’s dismissal, the first question which arises is whether there can be any scope for an issue under Article 8 in the light of the Gillberg exclusionary principle (see paragraph 98 above). According to that principle, where the negative effects complained of are limited to the consequences of the unlawful conduct which were foreseeable by the applicant, Article 8 cannot be relied upon to allege that such negative effects encroach upon private life. It has to be noted that in Gillberg the fact of the applicant’s unlawful conduct was largely undisputed (see Gillberg, cited above, § 71), whereas in the present case the applicant contested the very existence of any misconduct, thus implying that the measure involving his legal liability – his dismissal – could not have been a foreseeable consequence of his conduct in the position of president of a court of appeal. In these circumstances the present case is distinguishable from Gillberg and the Court cannot follow this approach.\n122: As to the consequences of the applicant’s dismissal for his “inner circle”, he contended that his removal had resulted in a reduction in his salary and in his prospective pension benefits. This argument has to be viewed as relating to the worsening of the material well-being of the applicant and his family. Even though the pecuniary element of the dispute has been considered significant for the purpose of the applicability of Article 6 under its civil head, this conclusion does not automatically bring the issue within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention. In the present case the applicant has not provided any evidence to suggest that the ensuing reduction in his monthly remuneration (see paragraph 22 above) seriously affected the “inner circle” of his private life. In the absence of such evidence, it would be speculative to assume the contrary. There are no other indications that the “inner circle” of the applicant’s private life was affected by the impugned measure.\n123: As to establishing and maintaining relationships with others, the applicant’s dismissal from the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal did not result in his removal from his profession. He continued to work as an ordinary judge and he remained at the same court alongside his colleagues. The applicant did not put forward any other allegations in this respect. It follows that, even if his opportunities to establish and maintain relationships, including those of a professional nature, might have been affected, there are no factual grounds for concluding that such effects were substantial. After all, it appears inappropriate to measure the extent and quality of relationships in private life in terms of administrative positions and roles.\n124: The question remains whether or not the impugned measure encroached upon the applicant’s reputation in such a way that it seriously affected his esteem among others, with the result that it has a serious impact on his interaction with society. The Court will look at this issue in terms of professional and social reputation.\n125: As regards the applicant’s professional reputation, the Court notes that his principal professional function was that of a judge. The profession of judge required him to possess specific knowledge, educational qualifications, skills and experience. In recompense for his service in this capacity, the applicant was paid the predominant part of his salary. At the same time, the successful performance of a presidential or administrative function in a court is not, strictly speaking, a characteristic of the judicial profession. Therefore, in objective terms, the judicial function constituted the applicant’s fundamental professional role. His position as president of a court, however important and prestigious it might be in the judicial sphere and however it might have been subjectively perceived and valued by the applicant, did not relate to the principal sphere of his professional activity.\n126: In the proceedings at issue, at no point did the domestic authorities examine the applicant’s performance as a judge or express any opinion as to his judicial competence and professionalism. The decisions in the applicant’s case concerned only his managerial skills, while his professional role as a judge was not touched upon. This limited area of scrutiny and criticism cannot be regarded as relating to the core of the applicant’s professional reputation. In that regard the present case differs in substance from Oleksandr Volkov (cited above), in which the applicant was criticised and received a disciplinary sanction for his performance as a judge.\n127: Next, the Court takes note of the applicant’s argument that, after he had occupied positions as president of a court over a period of twentyfive years, the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal had represented the apex of his legal career and his dismissal had undermined his peers’ opinion of his competence. However, the applicant did not specify how this alleged loss of esteem, even assuming that it affected the core of his professional reputation, had caused him serious prejudice in his professional environment. In any event, the Court does not have sufficient material to conclude that the alleged loss of esteem reached the high degree of seriousness required by Article 8 of the Convention, as discussed in paragraphs 116 and 117 above.\n128: In particular, the applicant did not substantiate how his dismissal from his position had affected his further career as a judge. The Court notes that the applicant’s dismissal did not preclude his reappointment, even though this latter consideration may have been purely theoretical, because of his advanced age. In any event, the measure did not have a significant effect as to its duration because it was limited by the applicant’s remaining period of service in the judiciary before he was due to reach the retirement age, about two years later (see Article 125 of the Constitution cited in paragraph 26 above).\n129: As regards social reputation in general, the criticism by the authorities did not affect a wider ethical aspect of the applicant’s personality and character. Even though the applicant’s dismissal was based on the findings of breaches of official duties in the administration of justice, it did not contain any accusation of intentional misconduct or criminal behaviour. The applicant’s moral values were not called into question and no reproaches of this nature can be identified in the impugned decisions (contrast Lekavičienė v. Lithuania, no. 48427/09, 27 June 2017, and Jankauskas v. Lithuania (no. 2), no. 50446/09, 27 June 2017).\n130: The applicant’s contention that the decision on his dismissal had been disseminated in the mass media and had become known to an unidentified number of persons cannot, as such, demonstrate substantial damage to his professional and social reputation. Moreover, the applicant failed to substantiate this allegation by providing specific details concerning the persons responsible for publishing such information, the coverage it received and its impact.\n131: Finally, there is no support in the file for the applicant’s allegation that the damage to his reputation was serious in view of the harm caused to the interests of his children and that this harm negatively affected his private life. This allegation has not been raised at domestic level and it has not been substantiated in the proceedings before the Court.\n132: The applicant did not put forward, either before the Court or in the domestic proceedings, any other specific personal circumstances indicating that the measure had had a serious impact on his private life.\n133: Accordingly, measuring the applicant’s subjective perceptions against the objective background and assessing the material and nonmaterial impact of his dismissal on the basis of the evidence presented before the Court, it has to be concluded that the dismissal had limited negative effects on the applicant’s private life and did not cross the threshold of seriousness for an issue to be raised under Article 8 of the Convention.\n134: Given that neither the reasons for the applicant’s dismissal were linked to nor that the consequences of that measure affected his “private life” within the meaning of Article 8, the Court finds that this Article is not applicable. The Government’s objection in this respect should therefore be upheld and the complaint must be dismissed as incompatible ratione materiae with the Convention pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4. In the light of this conclusion, it is not necessary to rule on the Government’s second objection, based on Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention.\n135: The applicant asserted before the Grand Chamber that his dismissal from the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal had pursued ulterior political purposes, in breach of Article 18 of the Convention. He further complained of a violation of his pecuniary rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 because he had been precluded from receiving a higher salary and higher retirement benefits. Those Articles provide:\n136: The Court notes that the applicant’s complaint under Article 18 of the Convention was raised for the first time in 2017, in the applicant’s submissions to the Grand Chamber. The complaint was therefore lodged outside the six-month time-limit and must be declared inadmissible in accordance with Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n137: As to the applicant’s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, this Article applies only to a person’s existing possessions and does not create a right to acquire property (see Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 82, ECHR 2011). Future income cannot be considered to constitute “possessions” unless it has already been earned or is definitely payable (see Erkan v. Turkey (dec.), no. 29840/03, 24 March 2005, and Anheuser-Busch Inc. v. Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, § 64, ECHR 2007I). The applicant’s dismissal from the post of court president precluded him from receiving a higher salary in that position and applying for higher retirement benefits at a later stage. However, this additional income has not actually been earned. Neither can it be argued that it was definitely payable. In these circumstances, this complaint is incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4.\n138: The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the principles of equality of arms, legal certainty and a “tribunal established by law” had been breached and that the requirement for decisions to contain proper reasons had not been complied with. Relying on Article 13 of the Convention, the applicant alleged that there had been no effective remedy in his case.\n139: Having regard to the facts of the case and the above findings under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention as regards the principles of an independent and impartial tribunal, the Court considers that the main legal questions under the Convention have been determined. It follows that there is no need to give a separate ruling on the admissibility and merits of the remaining complaints (see, among other authorities, Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, §§ 210-11, ECHR 2009, and Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, § 156, ECHR 2014, with further references).\n140: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n141: The applicant initially submitted a claim in respect of pecuniary damage, which he subsequently withdrew in a letter of 24 November 2017. The applicant also claimed 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n142: The Government submitted that the claim for non-pecuniary damage was unfounded.\n143: The Court considers that the applicant must have sustained non-pecuniary damage which the finding of a violation of the Convention in this judgment does not suffice to remedy. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant EUR 3,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n144: In the Chamber proceedings, Mr Denisov and eleven other applicants claimed jointly 15,691.97 pounds sterling (GBP) in respect of costs and expenses. Subsequently, the application by Mr Denisov was dealt with separately, following relinquishment of jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber. Before the Grand Chamber, Mr Denisov, who was represented by two lawyers, claimed GBP 33,600 in respect of legal fees, GBP 1,418.98 and EUR 2,499.79 in respect of administrative and translation costs and other disbursements, and GBP 712, EUR 630.20 and UAH 8,867 in respect of travel expenses, including the applicant’s personal appearance at the hearing before the Court. The applicant asked for the award for costs and expenses to be paid into the UK bank account designated by his representatives.\n145: The Government submitted that the claims were excessive and not sufficiently substantiated. They argued in particular that the claims for legal fees had been exaggerated and the translation costs had not been necessarily incurred. Accordingly, the award under this head had to be decreased substantially if a violation of the Convention were found.\n146: According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. Furthermore, costs and expenses are only recoverable to the extent that they relate to the violation found (see Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 10511/10, § 134, ECHR 2016). In this regard the Court notes that the applicant’s complaints were only partially successful and that a substantial portion of his pleadings concerned an inadmissible part of the application. In such circumstances the Court may find it appropriate to reduce the award in respect of costs and expenses (see, for example, Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, § 114, 10 March 2009, and Bayatyan v. Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 135, ECHR 2011).\n147: The Court further notes that the personal appearance of the applicant before the Grand Chamber was not required and it could be doubted if the costs and expenses in this regard were incurred necessarily (compare Martinie v. France [GC], no. 58675/00, § 62, ECHR 2006-VI). Nevertheless, taking into account the previous case-law (see, in particular, Folgerø and Others v. Norway [GC], no. 15472/02, § 112, ECHR 2007III, Söderman v. Sweden [GC], no. 5786/08, § 126, ECHR 2013, and Jeunesse v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 12738/10, § 135, 3 October 2014), the Court accepts that the costs and expenses connected with the applicant’s participation in the hearing before the Grand Chamber may be granted inasmuch as they are reasonable and properly substantiated.\n148: In the light of the above considerations, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 3,000 covering costs under all heads. As requested, the amount awarded is to be paid directly into the bank account designated by the applicant’s representatives (see, for example, Hristovi v. Bulgaria, no. 42697/05, § 109, 11 October 2011, and Singartiyski and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 48284/07, § 54, 18 October 2011).\n149: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

                "CASE OF YILMAZ v. TURKEY; § 1: . The case originated in an application (no. 36607/06) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Abdullah Yılmaz (“the applicant”), on 3 August 2006.\n2: . The applicant was represented by Mr V. Ata, a lawyer practising in Eskişehir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) was represented by its agent.\n3: . On 19 January 2010 the complaints concerning Article 6 § 1 (length of proceedings, alleged unfairness of the proceedings in breach of the principles of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings, and conflicting court decisions) and Article 8 of the Convention (right to respect for private life) were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\n4: . Neither the applicant nor the Government submitted observations on the merits. THE FACTS\n5: . The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Eskisehir.\n6: . At the material time he was a religious culture teacher and had passed a competitive examination organised by the Ministry of Education (“the Ministry”) giving access to teaching posts abroad.\n7: . On completion of the competitive examination, a document dated 4 August 2000 marked “secret” was drawn up. The document contained the following passages: “Abdullah Yılmaz ... – was taken into police custody on 19.06.1987 for damaging a bust of Atatürk in Kayseri [and was] then released on 22.06.1987 by the trial court; – practices separation [between men and women] (‘haremlik-selamlik’) in his household; – [his] wife, A.Y., conforms to the Islamic dress code in everyday life, but wears a wig in the school in which she works...” The document also states the following: “This document is intended for information only and cannot be used in evidence in court. [If the said information] is to be used ... the facts mentioned ... must be documented by the bodies and institutions in question, and the origin [of the information] must not be disclosed.”\n8: . On 21 August 2000 a Ministry assessment board drew up a list of fourteen teachers who had passed the competitive examination for access to posts abroad but who, consequently upon assessment of their situation pursuant to Article 15 of the Security and Archives Directive (“the Directive”), were refused access to such posts. The applicant’s name appeared on that list.\n9: . On 1 November 2000 the applicant sent the competent administrative authorities a request for information inviting them to explain why, given that he had come second in the competitive examination, he had not yet been given a post abroad. He pointed out that the person who had come third in the examination had already been appointed to such a post.\n10: . On 17 November 2000 the Ministry wrote to the provincial education authorities to inform them that the assessment of the applicant’s situation in the light of the criteria to be met by candidates in the competitive competition for an appointment abroad, as laid down in Article 5 of Section A of Circular 938 (2000/11) of 4 February 2000 (“the Circular”) had precluded the applicant’s appointment.\n11: . That information was transmitted to the applicant.\n12: . On 5 January 2001 the applicant lodged with the Eskişehir Administrative Court an application to stay the execution of and set aside the decision to refuse the appointment (“the impugned decision”) as groundless. He also claimed damages in respect of the non-pecuniary damage which he had suffered. In support of his appeal he argued, in particular, that the assessment board had given a decision which had relied on no practical grounds, and that therefore it had used its powers under Article 5 of Section A of the Circular in an arbitrary manner.\n13: . On 9 February 2001 the Ministry submitted pleadings in reply based on the criteria set out in Article 5 of Section A of the Circular, including “absence of impediment to discharge of functions (to be determined by the Ministry assessment board in the light of the findings of the staff security inquiry and archive search)”, as well as Articles 8, 12 and 15 of the Directive. It asked that the information concerning the applicant had been assessed by a board composed in conformity with Article 15 of the Directive and, in order to justify the impugned decision, referred to the public-interest principle and the needs and specific features of the educational and teaching services.\n14: . On 27 February 2001 the administrative court dismissed the application for a stay of execution lodged by the applicant.\n15: . On 13 April 2001 the applicant filed a memorial on the merits arguing that Article 8 of the Directive restricted the obligation to carry out a security inquiry to persons finally appointed to a post abroad, and that he therefore should not have been subjected to such an inquiry. He also pointed out that he had been working as a teacher for many years without the least problem, that he had come second in the competitive examination and that he had never engaged in blameworthy conduct – as witness his lack of a police record. He explained that his arrest in 1987, when he had been a student, had been the result of a misunderstanding and that the case had been dropped at the time. In that regard, he submitted that any security enquiry reaching a negative finding solely on that account would have been unlawful. He added that his conduct of his private life had no effect on the efficiency of his work. Furthermore, the authorities in question should have supported its allegations with proper evidence and explained how they considered that his private life constituted an obstacle to his professional duties. He considered that that was not the case.\n16: . On 13 September 2001 the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s action to set aside the impugned decision. In so doing it had regard to the provisions of Article 5 of Section A of the Circular and Articles 2 and 15 of the Directive, ruling as follows: “... Under the terms of Article 5 of Section A of the 04.02.2000 Circular ... ‘the absence of an impediment to discharging duties abroad (according to the findings of the staff security enquiry and archive search) must be established by the Ministry’s assessment board’; Article 2 of the Directive ... provides: ‘The present Directive ... sets out the principles and procedures relating to the security enquiries and archive searches to which all staff [wishing] to be permanently appointed abroad are subject ...’ Article 15 headed ‘assessment’ provides as follows: ‘... an assessment board shall be set up... if the information obtained as a result of the security enquiry and archive search is unfavourable ....’ ....” The court also noted that the applicant had passed the impugned competitive examination and had attended a retraining seminar organised in that context, but that the assessment board which had been set up following the security enquiry and archive search had decided that he could not be appointed to a post abroad. In the light of those circumstances, the evidence on file, the importance and the specific requirements of the posts abroad, the administrative court found that the impugned decision fell within the discretionary powers of the authority in question.\n17: . On 2 October 2001 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Council of State.\n18: . On 23 January 2002 the Council of State dismissed the application for a stay of execution of the administrative court’s decision.\n19: . On 13 May 2005 the Council of State dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law on the grounds that the decision at first instance had been given in accordance with the relevant legal and procedural rules. That judgment indicated that the reporting judge had issued an opinion in favour of confirming the first-instance decision. The Attorney General, for his part, held that the impugned refusal to make an appointment had been based solely on the findings of the security enquiry conducted by the intelligence services, which could not, by their very nature, be used in evidence. He added that “... the allegations had been the subject of a discontinuance decision given in 1987”. Moreover, no pleas had been advanced capable of justifying the impugned refusal to make an appointment, apart from information stemming from an intelligence-gathering exercise. He considered that the decision had been unlawful, that it should be set aside and that the applicant’s appeal should be allowed.\n20: . On 5 July 2005 the applicant lodged an application for rectification of that judgment. In his pleadings, he submitted, in particular, that the impugned administrative decision had not been based on objective criteria and was arbitrary. He added that the Attorney General had noted those facts in his opinion.\n21: . By judgment of 19 December 2005, notified on 7 February 2006, the Council of State dismissed the applicant’s appeal. That judgment stated that the reporting judge had issued an opinion in favour of dismissing the appeal. The Attorney General, on the other hand, held that the fact of using information stemming from intelligence-gathering was contrary to the rule-of-law principle, inasmuch as it had been obtained by an unidentified institution and, moreover, had not been confirmed by any other legally valid information or document. He therefore sought the annulment of the first-instance decision, on the further grounds that in the light of the relevant case-law that decision had been contrary to the equality principle. THE LAW ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n22: . The applicant submitted that the length of the proceedings before the national authorities had been incompatible with the “reasonable length” requirement. He also considered the failure to communicate the opinions of the reporting judge and the Attorney General to the Council of State as a breach of the equality of arms and the adversarial principles, and thus complained that the proceedings had been unfair on that account. Lastly, he complained of conflicting court decisions, and presented in support of that allegation two administrative court rulings in favour of teachers who had applied for posts abroad and had allegedly been turned down on the basis of the findings of security enquiries. He relied on Article 6 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which provide: Article 6 § 1 “In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by a ... tribunal ...”\n23: . The Government did not express a view. A. Applicability of Article 6 of the Convention\n24: . In the light of the principles set out in its case-law (see, among other authorities, Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, §§ 40-64, ECHR 2007 ‑ II, and Emel Boyraz v. Turkey , no. 61960/08, § 62, 2 December 2014), the Court considers that Article 6 of the Convention is applicable in the present case. B. Admissibility 1. As regards the failure to communicate the reporting judge’s opinion to the Council of State\n25: . The Court reiterates that it has already determined a similar issue in the framework of the case of Meral v. Turkey (no. 33446/02, §§ 40-43, 27 November 2007), where it found that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on that count. It considers that none of the circumstances of the present case warrant departing from that finding. Consequently, it holds that that complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention. 2. As regards the failure to communicate the Attorney General’s opinion to the Council of State\n26: . The Court reiterates that it has already considered a similar issue in Kılıç and Others v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 33162/10, §§ 19-32, 3 December 2013). In the latter case it found that the applicants had sustained no “major damage” in the exercise of their right to participate appropriately in the impugned proceedings, and it therefore declared their complaint inadmissible under Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention.\n27: . In the instant case, the Court notes that the Attorney General’s opinion was favourable to the applicant, and moreover that the latter had referred to that fact in his application for rectification of the judgment (see paragraphs 19-20 above). It can discern no particular reason to depart from its conclusions in the case of Kılıç and Others cited above.\n28: . The Court therefore considers that this complaint must be declared inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention. 3. As regards the allegation of conflicting court decisions\n29: . In the light of its case-law (see Nejdet Şahin and Perihan Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, §§ 49-58 and 94-95, 20 October 2011), the Court considers that it does not have sufficient information to conclude that the present case involved a situation of case-law uncertainty capable of infringing the principle of legal certainty. It considers therefore that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention. 4. As regards the length of proceedings\n30: . The Court emphasises that the Government submitted no observations in the present case. In the light of its case-law on the compensation remedy established in Turkey following the applica tion of the pilot judgment procedure in the case of Ümmühan Kaplan v. Turkey (no. 24240/07, 20 March 2012), the Court considers that since the Government raised no objection regarding such remedy, it should proceed to examine the applicant’s complaint concerning the length of proceedings (see Sodan v. Turkey , no. 18650/05, §§ 63-65, 2 February 2016).\n31: . The Court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention. It must therefore be declared admissible. C. Merits\n32: . In the instant case, the Court notes that the impugned proceedings lasted some four years and eleven months before the administrative courts, including three years and seven months before the Council of State, pending its decision on the merits of the dispute. In that connection, it reiterates that the “reasonableness” of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, § 43, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII, and Rodoplu v. Turkey , no. 41665/02, § 31, 23 January 2007).\n33: . The Court has examined cases raising similar issues to that in the instant case on numerous occasions and has found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Frydlender, cited above, § 46, and Rodoplu , cited above, § 32).\n34: . Having examined all the evidence presented to it, the Court cannot discern any fact or argument capable of persuading the Court to reach a different conclusion as regards the merits of the complaint in question. Having regard to its relevant case-law, it considers that in the present case the length of the impugned proceedings was excessive, in breach of the “reasonable length” requirement. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n35: . The applicant complained of an infringement of his right to respect for his private life. He alleged that the domestic authorities had unduly subjected him and his family to a security enquiry and had refused, relying on information concerning his private life obtained by means of that enquiry, to appoint him to one of the posts to which the fact of passing the competitive examination should have given him access. He relied on Article 8 of the Convention, which provides: “1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life .... 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” A. Applicability of Article 8 of the Convention\n36: . The Court first of all notes that the present case concerns an employment-related dispute between an individual and a State. It then reiterates that has on many occasions examined cases raising the issue of the applicability of the concept of “private life”, within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention, to employment-related complaints.\n37: . In its recent Denisov v. Ukraine judgment ([GC], no. 76639/11, 25 September 2018), the Court drew up an evolutive typology of cases of employment-related disputes which it has dealt with. Acknowledging that such disputes are not per se excluded from the scope of “private life”, it determined the criteria for the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention in such situations. It thus established that generally speaking, there are two ways in which a private-life issue would usually arise in such a dispute: either because of the underlying reasons for the impugned measure (in that event the Court employs the reason-based approach) or because of the consequences for private life (in that event the Court employs the consequence-based approach) (ibid., § 115).\n38: . The Court will examine the present case in the light of the approaches defined above. That means determining how a private-life issue can arise in the situation in question, whether from the underlying reasons for the applicant’s non-appointment, or from the consequences of the latter for his private life.\n39: . The applicant submitted that his appointment abroad had been turned down for reasons linked to his and his wife’s private life. In that connection it should be remembered that the applicant – who was a religious culture teacher at the time – passed a competitive examination which should have enabled him to be appointed to a post abroad. Having passed the examination, he also attended a seminar geared to adapting his competences (see paragraph 16 above). However, a Ministry assessment board decided that the applicant’s situation was such that he could not be appointed to a post abroad. Having regard to the evidence on file and, in particular, the decisions of the administrative courts, the Court observes that the refusal to appoint the applicant was based on the findings of a security enquiry which had disclosed information on the applicant’s private life, such as his lifestyle and his wife’s mode of attire. Reference was also made to an arrest which had occurred a long time before and which had been the subject of a discontinuance decision.\n40: . The Court also notes that apart from the information obtained from the security enquiry, the competent administrative authorities provided no employment-related and/or administrative reasons to explain why the applicant could not be appointed to a post abroad (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). Moreover, the Attorney General with the Council of State twice criticised this failure to give reasons (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above). The Court further notes that the administrative authorities also failed to explain how the information obtained by means of the security enquiry was such as to debar per se the applicant from discharging his duties abroad.\n41: . In the light of all these considerations, the Court agrees with the applicant that the underlying reasons for refusing to appoint him were based solely on the information on his private life. Indeed, the underlying reasons for a measure affecting professional life may be linked to the individual’s private life and these reasons themselves may render Article 8 applicable (see Denisov, cited above, § 103; Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom , nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 71, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI; Obst v. Germany , no. 425/03, §§ 43 et seq., 23 September 2010; and Özpınar v. Turkey , no. 20999/04, §§ 47-48, 19 October 2010). The Court therefore holds that Article 8 of the Convention is applicable in the present case. B. Admissibility\n42: . The Court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention. It must therefore be declared admissible. C. Merits\n43: . In the instant case the Court considers that the refusal to appoint the applicant amounted to an interference with the exercise of his right to respect for his private life. Such interference will contravene Article 8 unless it is “in accordance with the law”, pursues one or more legitimate aims and is “necessary in a democratic society” in order to achieve them.\n44: . The Court observes that the Government failed to specify the legal basis for the interference, the legitimate aim pursued and the reasons why that interference might be deemed necessary in a democratic society.\n45: . In that regard, the Court deems it useful to reiterate that with reference to the provisions of a circular and a directive, the national authorities considered that the applicant was debarred from taking up a post abroad (see paragraphs 8, 10 and 13 above). The Ministry of Education mentioned the “public interest” principle and overriding needs in order to justify that decision, albeit without providing any explanations as to the public-interest reasons at issue or the necessities and peculiarities of the education and teaching services which might have explained why a teacher employed by the Ministry could not hold a post abroad (see paragraph 13 above).\n46: . On reading the assessment board’s decision (see paragraph 8 above), the Court also observes that that board had not given its view on the applicant’s competences or capacities in terms of discharging the duties in question, but confined itself to the findings of the security enquiry. However, those findings had attached primary importance to aspects of the applicant’s and his wife’s private life, especially the fact that she wore an Islamic headscarf (see paragraph 7 above).\n47: . In that connection the Court reiterates that it has previously held that the aim of protecting civil service neutrality could not justify having regard, in a decision to transfer a civil servant, to the fact that his wife wore an Islamic headscarf, which fell within the ambit of the couple’s private life (see Sodan , § 57, cited above). Of course, the Court does not rule out the possibility that under certain circumstances specific civil-service requirements necessitate taking into account the findings of security enquiries. Nevertheless, it is difficult to understand how, in the present case, the applicant’s mode of conduct at home and the fact of his wife wearing a headscarf (see paragraph 7 above) – which matters fall within the ambit of private life – could possibly interfere with public-interest requirements or the needs of the educational services. It further notes that the applicant’s previous arrest had not led to any criminal prosecution, nor had it impeded his access to the teaching profession.\n48: . In concluding this assessment of the circumstances of the present case, the Court regards it as established that the decision not to appoint the applicant to a post abroad had been motivated by factors falling within the ambit of his private life. Even supposing that this interference was prescribed by law and pursued one of the legitimate aims set out in Article 8 § 2, the Court considers that in any case the interference was not necessary in a democratic society.\n49: . There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n50: . Article 41 of the Convention provides: “If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”\n51: The applicant did not submit a claim for just satisfaction. The Court considers therefore that no award should be made under this head.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,\nDeclares\n the application admissible as regards the complaints concerning Article 6 § 1 (on account of the length of proceedings) and Article 8 of the Convention, and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\nHolds \nthat there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 on account of the excessive length of proceedings;\nHolds \nthat there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\nDone in French, and"

            "001-193746\n37. In its recent Denisov v. Ukraine judgment ([GC], no. 76639/11, 25 September 2018), the Court drew up an evolutive typology of cases of employment-related disputes which it has dealt with. Acknowledging that such disputes are not per se excluded from the scope of “private life”, it determined the criteria for the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention in such situations. It thus established that generally speaking, there are two ways in which a private-life issue would usually arise in such a dispute: either because of the underlying reasons for the impugned measure (in that event the Court employs the reason-based approach) or because of the consequences for private life (in that event the Court employs the consequence-based approach) (ibid., § 115).",
            "001-186216\n102: In the cases falling into the above-mentioned category, the Court applies the concept of “private life” on the basis of two different approaches: (α) identification of the “private life” issue as the reason for the dispute (reason-based approach) and (β) deriving the “private life” issue from the consequences of the impugned measure (consequence-based approach).",
            "001-186216\n115: The Court concludes from the above case-law that employment-related disputes are not per se excluded from the scope of “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. There are some typical aspects of private life which may be affected in such disputes by dismissal, demotion, non-admission to a profession or other similarly unfavourable measures. These aspects include (i) the applicant’s “inner circle”, (ii) the applicant’s opportunity to establish and develop relationships with others, and (iii) the applicant’s social and professional reputation. There are two ways in which a private-life issue would usually arise in such a dispute: either because of the underlying reasons for the impugned measure (in that event the Court employs the reason-based approach) or – in certain cases – because of the consequences for private life (in that event the Court employs the consequence-based approach).",
            "001-186216\n109: Where no reason-based approach justifies the applicability of Article 8, an analysis of the effects of the impugned measure on the above-mentioned aspects of private life is necessary to conclude that the complaint falls within the scope of “private life”. Nevertheless, this division does not preclude cases in which the Court may find it appropriate to employ both approaches in combination, examining whether there is a private-life issue in the underpinning reasons for the impugned measure and, in addition, analysing the consequences of the measure (see Fernández Martínez, cited above, §§ 110-12).",
            "001-193746\n38. The Court will examine the present case in the light of the approaches defined above. That means determining how a private-life issue can arise in the situation in question, whether from the underlying reasons for the applicant’s non-appointment, or from the consequences of the latter for his private life.",
            "001-186216\n116: If the consequence-based approach is at stake, the threshold of severity with respect to all the above-mentioned aspects assumes crucial importance. It is for the applicant to show convincingly that the threshold was attained in his or her case. The applicant has to present evidence substantiating consequences of the impugned measure. The Court will only accept that Article 8 is applicable where these consequences are very serious and affect his or her private life to a very significant degree.",
            "001-186216\n43: It is common ground between the parties that Article 6 § 1 is not applicable under its criminal limb. Indeed, the proceedings at issue did not relate to the determination of a criminal charge, and for this reason the criminal limb does not apply (see, mutatis mutandis, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, §§ 93-95).",
            "001-186216\n114: It is thus an intrinsic feature of the consequence-based approach within Article 8 that convincing evidence showing that the threshold of severity was attained has to be submitted by the applicant. As the Grand Chamber has held, applicants are obliged to identify and explain the concrete repercussions on their private life and the nature and extent of their suffering, and to substantiate such allegations in a proper way (see Gillberg, cited above, §§ 70-73). According to the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies, such allegations have to be sufficiently raised at the domestic level.",
            "001-193746\n36. The Court first of all notes that the present case concerns an employment-related dispute between an individual and a State. It then reiterates that has on many occasions examined cases raising the issue of the applicability of the concept of “private life”, within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention, to employment-related complaints.",
            "001-186216\n113: In the recent case of Erményi the Court found that the applicant’s dismissal from the administrative position of Vice-President of the Supreme Court constituted an interference with his right to respect for private life (see Erményi, cited above, § 31). Even though the Court did not elaborate on this point, in the absence of the parties’ submissions in that regard, it implied that the impugned measure had seriously affected the applicant’s private life. That finding cannot be read as presuming that the applicant’s dismissal had “automatically” generated an issue in the sphere of private life. In that regard the Court reiterates that the threshold of severity occupies an important place in cases where the existence of a private-life issue is examined according to the consequence-based approach."
