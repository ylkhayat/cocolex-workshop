The FSRA has engaged in extensive discussions with local and international banks for the purposes of providing an overview of the Virtual Asset Framework and the stringent authorisation requirements imposed on Applicants when applying to become an Authorised Person.  It is intended that those banks with a risk appetite to bank Virtual Asset players will glean comfort from the regulatory oversight of the FSRA and the issuance of an IPA to entities demonstrating that they have a clear roadmap of development of their business towards final approval and issuance of an FSP.  The process for approval for the opening of a bank account with local or international banks will typically include a full explanation and review of an Applicant’s AML and Client on-boarding processes and procedures, as well as its ability to monitor the source and destination of funds, amongst other areas of its Virtual Asset activities.\n\n\n179) FEES\nAuthorisation and supervision fees\nThe Fees applicable to Authorised Persons conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets have been established in consideration of the risks involved in relation to Virtual Asset activities and the supervisory requirements placed on the FSRA to suitably regulate these Authorised Persons and Virtual Asset activities in ADGM.\n\n180) FEES\nAuthorisation and supervision fees\nPursuant to FEES Rule 13.17.1, an Applicant for an FSP to conduct a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets must pay, at the time of submission of its Application, an initial authorisation fee of (as applicable):\n\na)\t$20,000; or\n\nb)\t$125,000 if\n\n19\napplicable to Authorised Persons conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets have been established in consideration of the risks involved in relation to Virtual Asset activities and the supervisory requirements placed on the FSRA to suitably regulate these Authorised Persons and Virtual Asset activities in ADGM.\n\n180) FEES\nAuthorisation and supervision fees\nPursuant to FEES Rule 13.17.1, an Applicant for an FSP to conduct a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets must pay, at the time of submission of its Application, an initial authorisation fee of (as applicable):\n\na)\t$20,000; or\n\nb)\t$125,000 if the Applicant is seeking to operate an MTF (in relation to Virtual Assets).\n\n181) FEES\nAuthorisation and supervision fees\nAs set out earlier in paragraph 173, the FSRA will only consider an Application as having been formally submitted, and commence its formal review of the Application, upon receipt of both the completed Application and the associated fees.\n\n182) FEES\nAuthorisation and supervision fees\nPursuant to FEES Rule 3.17.2, annual supervision fees for an Authorised Person conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets, payable in accordance with paragraph 1 of the FEES Rulebook, are set as follows:\n\na)\t$15,000; or\n\nb)\t$60,000 if the Applicant is seeking to operate an MTF (in relation to Virtual Assets).\n\n183) FEES\nCumulative application of Fees\nSubject to paragraph 185 below, if an Applicant/Authorised Person will be conducting multiple Regulated Activities in relation to Virtual Assets as part of its FSP, the fees (authorisation and supervision) payable by that Authorised Person will be cumulative, and considered across the following:\n\na)\tAuthorised Person intermediary-type activities (being “Non-Custody Intermediary Activities”);\n\nb)\tactivities as a Virtual Asset Custodian (Providing Custody); and\n\nc)\tactivities as an MTF.\n\n184) FEES\nCumulative application of Fees\nIn practice, and to further clarify, this results in several scenarios for FEES in relation to Virtual Asset activities, being:\n\na)\tNon-Custody Intermediary Activities only = Application Fee of $20,000 and annual supervision fee of $15,000 (irrespective of\n\n19\npublic, regardless of whether they are Clients), and allowing trades to automatically be matched using an exchange-type matching engine as characteristic of an MTF using Virtual Assets, and not activities acceptable for an intermediary-type Authorised Person to undertake.\n\n108) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nVirtual Asset Brokers or Dealers\nAn Authorised Person (conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets) that only has an FSP to operate as a broker / dealer and not as an MTF is required to design and structure its operations, user interface, website, marketing materials and any public or client-facing information such that it does not create the impression that it is running an MTF.  In practice, this may include not displaying any publicly-accessible information that may appear like a trading order book, not providing for any price discovery, and not giving actual or potential Clients the impression that they are interacting with an MTF.\n\n109) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nVirtual Asset Brokers or Dealers\nVirtual Asset brokers / dealers are required to comply with the best execution requirements in COBS Rule 6.5 at all times.\n\n110) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nVirtual Asset Brokers or Dealers\nVirtual Asset brokers / dealers are required to disclose the following information to Clients:\n\na)\thow they execute and route Client’s orders and source liquidity (e.g., whether they pass or route orders to other brokers, dealers or exchanges to execute). Where a broker / dealer routes Client orders to a single liquidity source such as an MTF for execution, it must also disclose this to all Clients;\n\nb)\twhether it may carry out proprietary trading on its own account, and if so, whether it may trade against Clients’ positions;\n\nc)\tthe fees it charges Clients; and\n\nd)\thow it determines the prices of the Accepted Virtual Assets it quotes to Clients.\n\n111) SPECIFIC FSRA\n\n19\nand controls):  MIR Rule 2.6.1 requires an MTF to ‘establish a robust operational risk management framework with appropriate systems and controls to identify, monitor and manage operational risks that key participants, other [MTFs], service providers (including outsourcees) and utility providers might pose to itself.’\n\ni.\tIn relation to systems and controls, the FSRA has provided guidance on what it expects in relation to technology governance controls in paragraphs 47 to 92 of this Guidance.  The FSRA therefore requires an MTF to undertake its ‘MTF’ activities in compliance with these operational system and control requirements, in combination with the technology governance controls outlined earlier in this Guidance.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA expects an MTF to undertake extensive due diligence and testing of its operational systems and controls, with the relevant reports of such testing capable of being provided to the FSRA for review.  Such testing should be undertaken by an officer of the MTF possessing appropriate skills and experience.  The testing reports need to confirm the robustness of the MTF’s systems and address any potential areas of failure.  Testing should include the settlement processes for the movement of Virtual Assets between wallets, and the general connectivity of the MTF’s systems with other parties.  Testing should be ongoing, building in processes for the introduction of new Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\niii.\tAn MTF will need to provide policies and procedures that clearly evidence how it will effectively address a failure of its systems.  Failures must be rectified as soon as practicable, with an MTF’s business continuity plan including detailed and realistic response timeframes for failures or disruptions.\n\nb)\tMIR Rules 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 (Transaction recording):  FSRA expects that the primary ledger technology systems and controls of an MTF (whether they be DLT or multiple-ledger technologies) will be such that transaction recording and reporting is\n\n19\nof the requirements across these Rules - for example, MIR Rule 2.8.5 contains substantive provisions that should apply, regardless of what model of ‘access’ an MTF (using Virtual Assets) utilises.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA recognises, however, that MTFs (using Virtual Assets) generally operate an ‘access’ model that does not include Members  (e.g., access is granted directly to (retail and institutional) Clients of the MTF).  An MTF operating in this manner will, therefore, need to ensure that it has appropriate processes, controls and rules to ‘protect the orderly functioning’ of its market, its facilities and the interests of its investors.\n\niii.\tBy not adopting a ‘Member-access’ model and allowing direct ‘Client-access’, MTFs lose one layer of regulatory/supervisory defense that Recognised Investment Exchanges and Member-access MTFs have, in that they do not have Members assisting them in the undertaking of the necessary due diligence and compliance reviews of investors being on-boarded into their market.  The FSRA, in these circumstances, requires MTFs to undertake their own CDD reviews for every client accessing (trading on) their market (something which traditionally a Recognised Investment Exchange or Member-access MTF can rely on its Members to do). Resultant AML/CFT obligations therefore fall more directly on a Client-access MTF as well.\n\niv.\tThe FSRA expects that the controls (and resultant resourcing needs) of an MTF be appropriately budgeted and accounted for, including specific controls for when it has Clients that are institutional Clients (as the current conventional Member/institutional client global regulatory model may not properly account for, and mitigate, the risks relevant to operating such model within the Virtual Asset space).  For example, where an MTF has institutional Clients that are regulated as Authorised Persons (for example, an Authorised Person that is a broker / dealer) within ADGM, the MTF may take comfort from the fact that its Clients are appropriately\n\n19\nthat a number of meetings will need to be held between an Applicant and the FSRA before the Applicant will be in a position to submit a draft, then formal, application.\n\n173) APPLICATION PROCESS\nSubmission of Formal Application\nFollowing discussions with the FSRA, and upon the FSRA having reasonable comfort that the Applicant’s proposed business processes, technologies and capabilities are at a sufficiently advanced stage, the Applicant will be required to submit a completed Virtual Asset Application Form, and supporting documents, to the FSRA .  The Applicant’s supporting documents include the submission of a detailed launch plan reflecting each of the steps (referencing the full set of operational and regulatory requirements) that the Applicant will take to progress from Application phase, through IPA and FSP to launch. Payment of the fees applicable to the Application, as set out in paragraphs 179 - 187, must also be made at the time of submission.  The FSRA will only consider an Application as having been formally submitted, and commence its formal review of the Application, upon receipt of both the completed Application, detailed launch plan and the associated fees.\n\n174) APPLICATION PROCESS\nGranting of In Principle Approval (IPA)\nThe FSRA will undertake an in depth review of the Application, and supporting documents, submitted by an Applicant.  The FSRA will only consider granting an IPA for a FSP to those Applicants that are considered able to adequately meet all applicable Rules and requirements.  An Applicant will be required to meet all conditions applicable to the IPA prior to being granted with final approval and an FSP for the relevant Regulated Activity.\n\n175) APPLICATION PROCESS\nGranting of Final Approval (Financial Services Permission)\nSubject to being satisfied that the Applicant has met all conditions applicable to the IPA, the FSRA will grant the Applicant with final approval for an FSP for\n\n19\nbe conducting multiple Regulated Activities in relation to Virtual Assets as part of its FSP, the fees (authorisation and supervision) payable by that Authorised Person will be cumulative, and considered across the following:\n\na)\tAuthorised Person intermediary-type activities (being “Non-Custody Intermediary Activities”);\n\nb)\tactivities as a Virtual Asset Custodian (Providing Custody); and\n\nc)\tactivities as an MTF.\n\n184) FEES\nCumulative application of Fees\nIn practice, and to further clarify, this results in several scenarios for FEES in relation to Virtual Asset activities, being:\n\na)\tNon-Custody Intermediary Activities only = Application Fee of $20,000 and annual supervision fee of $15,000 (irrespective of the number of Non-Custody Intermediary Activities proposed to be undertaken).\n\nb)\tVirtual Asset Custodian and Non-Custody Intermediary Activities = Application fee of $40,000 and annual supervision fee of $30,000.\n\nc)\tMTF = Application fee of $125,000 and annual supervision fee of $60,000.\n\nd)\tMTF and Virtual Asset Custodian = Application fee of $145,000 and annual supervision fee of $75,000.\n\n185) FEES\nCumulative application of Fees\nNoting the above paragraph, if an Applicant/Authorised Person will be undertaking a Regulated Activity involving conventional assets (e.g. securities or derivatives) in addition to Virtual Assets, as noted in paragraphs 20 to 21, it will need to seek approval from the FSRA to carry out its Regulated Activity in relation to both asset types (conventional and Virtual Asset).  The fees attributable to that Authorised Person for its Regulated Activities (conventional and Virtual Asset-related), may not be cumulative should the FSRA apply its discretion to reduce or waive a fee, under FEES 1.2.8 subject to the considerations set out in paragraph 187 below).  The FSRA recommends that Applicants discuss any questions relating to FEES with the FSRA as early as practicable.\n\n186) FEES\nCumulative application of Fees\nPursuant to FEES Rule 3.15.1, an MTF using Virtual Assets must pay to the FSRA a trading levy on a sliding scale basis (as set out in the table\n\n19\nENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nTechnology Governance and Controls\nWhile the FSRA adopts a technology-neutral approach to the regulation of Authorised Persons, Virtual Asset technology is widely considered to be in its early years of development and usage at scale. While it does not seek to regulate Virtual Asset technologies directly, the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to meet particular requirements in terms of their technology systems, governance and controls.\n\n48) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nTechnology Governance and Controls\nHistorically, Virtual Asset business failures have often arisen as a result of the lack of adequate technology-related procedures, including, for example, lack of security measures, systems development methodologies, limited system penetration testing for operating a robust business and lack of technical leadership and management.  The FSRA has therefore included specific Guidance regarding expected controls and processes to help mitigate these issues.\n\n49) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nTechnology Governance and Controls\nGEN Rule 3.3 requires an Authorised Person to establish systems and controls to ensure its affairs are managed effectively and responsibly, and to ensure such systems and controls are subject to continuous monitoring and review. COBS Rule 17.5 sets out additional requirements for appropriate technology governance and controls specific to Authorised Persons, with a focus on:\n\na)\tVirtual Asset Wallets;\n\nb)\tPrivate and Public Keys;\n\nc)\tOrigin and destination of Virtual Asset funds;\n\nd)\tSecurity; and\n\ne)\tRisk Management.\n\n50) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nTechnology Governance and Controls\nWhen complying with GEN Rule 3.3 and COBS Rule 17.5, Authorised Persons should have due regard to the following key areas from a technology perspective:\n\na)\tCareful maintenance and development of systems and architecture (e.g., code version control, implementation of updates, issue resolution, and regular internal and third party testing);\n\nb)\tSecurity measures and\n\n19\na Regulated Activity that incidentally involves the use of Virtual Assets may still be subject to relevant Rules in Chapter 17 of COBS (e.g., in relation to Accepted Virtual Assets, technology governance, disclosure requirements) to ensure that appropriate activity is undertaken as part of their Regulated Activities.\n\n\n23) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nConducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets\nChapter 17 of COBS applies to all Authorised Persons conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets, requiring compliance with all requirements set out in COBS Rules 17.1 – 17.6. Authorised Persons that are Operating a Multilateral Trading Facility or Providing Custody in relation to Virtual Assets are also required to comply with the additional requirements set out in COBS Rules 17.7 or 17.8 respectively.\n\n24) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nAccepted Virtual Assets\nCOBS Rule 17.2.1 permits an Authorised Person to conduct a Regulated Activity in relation to Accepted Virtual Assets only.  The FSRA has a general power to determine each Accepted Virtual Asset that will be permitted to be used by an Authorised Person within ADGM, in order to prevent potential higher-risk activities relating to illiquid or ‘immature’ Virtual Assets.\n\n25) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nAccepted Virtual Assets\nA Virtual Asset that meets the FSRA’s requirements, as demonstrated by an individual Authorised Person, will constitute an Accepted Virtual Asset for that individual Authorised Person only. COBS Rule 17.2.2 states that for the purpose of determining whether, in its opinion, a Virtual Asset meets the requirements of being an Accepted Virtual Asset, the FSRA will consider those factors it considers relevant, which at the date of this Guidance include seven key factors as set out below:\n\na)\tMaturity:\n\n19\nrelevant compliance activities internally (and not be able to rely on their ‘members’ for such purposes).\n\nvi.\tDepending on the model, controls and criteria to be adopted by an MTF, the class order modification or waiver relief granted by the FSRA to Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities using Virtual Assets as referred to in paragraph 112 of the Guidance may apply.\n\nRulebook(s)\n\nvii.\tFurther to MIR Rule 2.8, the FSRA expects an MTF to have a rulebook(s) in place.  This rulebook should be clearly labelled as such and be publicly available on the website of the MTF.\n\nviii.\tSupporting documents such as participation agreements, terms of business, product lists, user guides and technical specifications are also a key part of the operation of an MTF, and should be consistent with its rulebook.  The FSRA does not consider that the existence of these documents alone meet the requirement of having a transparent and effective rulebook.  The FSRA considers it good practice that these supporting documents are available and transparent, alongside the published rulebook, to the extent possible.\n\nix.\tThe content of a rulebook  should enable an MTF to demonstrate how it is complying with MIR Rule 2.8, be supported by procedures that are complete and clear, and all in support of an MTF seeking to ensure that behaviour within its market is fair and orderly.\n\nx.\tThe FSRA expects MTFs to require explicit acknowledgement via a user agreement, that participants have read, understood and will abide by the rulebook at all times.\n\nxi.\tThe FSRA expects an MTF to undertake regular reviews of its rulebook to ensure it is consistent with relevant regulatory and legislative requirements.  Best practice may see such activity undertaken no less than every twelve-months.\n\nd)\tMIR Rule 2.9 (Financial crime and market abuse):  MTFs are required to operate an effective market surveillance program to identify, monitor,\u003C/s\u003E\u003Cs\u003E[INST] You are a regulatory compliance and legal expert reviewing regulatory documents.

Application to Branches and Groups: As part of the flexible and proportionate application of corporate governance standards to Authorised Persons, whether an Authorised Person is a Branch or a Subsidiary within a Group is also taken into account. An Authorised Person which is a member of a Group may, instead of developing its own corporate governance policies, adopt Group wide corporate governance standards. However, the Governing Body of the Authorised Person should consider whether those standards are appropriate for the Authorised Person, and to the extent possible, make any changes as necessary.\n\n3.3.41.(3).Guidance.9. Application to Branches and Groups: In the case of a Branch, corporate governance practices adopted at the head office would generally apply to the Branch and are expected to be adequate. The Regulator considers, as part of its authorisation of a Branch and on going supervision, the adequacy of regulatory and supervisory arrangements applicable in the home jurisdiction, including a corporate governance framework adopted and implemented by the head office (see the GPM).\n\n3.3.41.(3).Guidance.10. Best practice relating to corporate governance: In addition to the considerations noted above, best practice that an Authorised Person may adopt to achieve compliance with the applicable corporate governance standards is set out in Guidance at Appendix ‎1.1. An Authorised Person may, where the best practice set out in Appendix ‎1.1 is not suited to its particular business or structure, deviate from such best practice or any aspects thereof.

Rules in other areas of the Rulebook build upon these fundamental principles. Consequently the Rules and Guidance elsewhere in the Rulebook should not be seen as exhausting the implications of the Principles.\n\n2.1.3.Guidance.2 Breaching a Principle for Authorised Persons makes an Authorised Person liable to disciplinary action, and may indicate that it is no longer fit and proper to carry on a Regulated Activity or to hold a Financial Services Permission and the Regulator may consider withdrawing authorisation or the Financial Services Permission on that basis.\n\n2.1.3.Guidance.3 The onus will be on the Regulator to show that the Authorised Person has been at fault in some way, taking into account the standard of conduct required under the Principle in question.\n\n2.2 The Principles for Authorised Persons\n\n2.2.1 Principle 1   Integrity: An Authorised Person must observe high standards of integrity and fair dealing.\n\n2.2.2 Principle 2   Due skill, care and diligence: In conducting its business activities, an Authorised Person must act with due skill, care and diligence.\n\n2.2.3 Principle 3   Management, systems and controls: An Authorised Person\n\n7\nstandard of conduct required under the Principle in question.\n\n9.6 Principles for Representative Offices\n\n9.6.1 Principle 1 - Integrity.

A Representative Office must deal with Regulators in an open and cooperative manner and keep the Regulator promptly informed of significant events or anything else relating to the Representative Office of which the Regulator would reasonably expect to be notified.\n\n9.7 General provisions\n9.7.1 A Representative Office must have a place of business within the geographical boundaries of the ADGM.\n9.7.2 A Representative Office must not:\n(1)\t share an office with another Authorised Person;\n(2)\trepresent anyone other than itself or a member of its Group; or\n(3)\tpermit any staff member to be an Employee of another Authorised Person or Recognised Body.\n9.7.2.Guidance The Regulator would generally not consider a Representative Office to be sharing an office with an Authorised Person if that Representative Office were located in serviced offices which were also the place of business of an Authorised Person.\n9.8 Fitness and Propriety\n9.8.1 A Representative Office must at all times be fit and proper to hold a Financial Services Permission.\n9.8.2\n9.8.2.(1) A Representative Office must at all times have a Principal Representative who is \tresident in the U.A.E. and who has satisfied the Regulator as to fitness and \tpropriety.\n9.8.2.(2) If the Principal Representative leaves the employment of a Representative Office, the Representative Office must designate a successor as soon as possible, and in any event within 28 days.\n9.8.2.(3) If the Regulator considers that a\n\n7\nfor six years from the date on which it was established or superseded by a more up to date record.\n\n3.3 Systems and controls\n\n3.3.1.(1) General requirement: An Authorised Person must establish and maintain systems and controls, including but not limited to financial and risk systems and controls, that ensure that its affairs are managed effectively and responsibly by its senior management.\n\n3.3.1.(2) General requirement: An Authorised Person must undertake regular reviews of its systems and controls.\n\n3.3.1.(2).Guidance \n\n3.3.1.(2).Guidance.1. The nature and extent of the systems and controls of an Authorised Person will depend upon a variety of factors including the nature, scale and complexity of its business. While all Authorised Persons, irrespective of the nature, scale, and complexity of their business and legal structure or organisation need to comply with this Chapter, the Regulator will take into account these factors and the differences that exist between Authorised Person when assessing the adequacy of an Authorised Person’s systems and controls. Nevertheless, neither these factors nor the differences relieve an Authorised Person from compliance with its regulatory obligations.\n\n\n3.3.2.(1) Organisation: An Authorised Person must establish and implement, taking due account of the nature, scale and complexity of its business and structure, adequate measures to ensure that:\n(a)\tthe roles and responsibilities assigned to its Governing Body and the members of that body, senior management and Persons Undertaking Key Control Functions are clearly defined;\n(b)\tthere are clear reporting lines applicable to the individuals undertaking those functions; and\n(c)\tthe roles, responsibilities and reporting lines referred to in ‎(a) and ‎(b) are documented and communicated to all relevant Employees.\n\n3.3.2.(2) Organisation: An Authorised Person must ensure that any Employee who will be delivering Regulated Activities to its Customers is clearly identified, together with his respective lines of accountability and supervision.\n\n3.3.2.(3) Organisation: An Authorised Person which is conducting Investment Business or the Regulated Activities of\n\n7\nconditions subject to which a Person is approved as a Controller, that Person must comply with those conditions.\n8.8.13.(5) Where the Regulator has issued a final notice declaring a Person to be an unacceptable Controller, that Person must dispose of the relevant Holdings within such period as specified in the final notice.\n8.8.13.(6) The Regulator may apply to the Court for the order of the sale or disposition of shares held in Contravention to a final notice, in accordance with ‎(5).\n8.8.13.(7) The Regulator must also notify the Authorised Person of any decision it has made pursuant to ‎(3).\n8.8.13.(8) The Regulator may give a restriction notice directing that, Shares or voting power Held by a Controller in respect of which a final notice has been given, are subject to one or more of the following restrictions:\n(a)\tany agreement to transfer or a transfer of any such Shares or voting power is void;\n(b)\tno voting power is to be exercisable;\n(c)\tno further Shares are to be issued in pursuance of any right of the Holder of any such Shares or voting power or in pursuance of any offer made to their Holder; and\n(d)\tsave for in instances of liquidation, no payment is to be made of any sums due in respect of any such Shares.\n8.8.13.(9) If the Regulator decides to exercise its power under this Rule to object to a Person as a Controller, to impose conditions or restrictions on an approval or to require a Person to dispose of their Holdings, the Person may refer the matter to the Appeals Panel for review.\n8.8.13.(9).Guidance The GPM sets out the matters which the Regulator takes into consideration when exercising its powers under Rule ‎8.8.13.\n\n8.8.14 Contraventions of the Rules under this Chapter\n8.8.14.(1) A Person commits a Contravention of the Rules under this Chapter where it:\n(a)\tfails to comply with any obligation\n\n7\nRegulator may act on its own initiative to withdraw a Representative Office’s Financial Services Permission.\n\n9.5 Application of core principles\n9.5.1\n9.5.1.(1) The four Principles for Representative Offices set out in ‎9.6 apply to every \tRepresentative Office in accordance with Rule ‎9.1.1.\n9.5.1.(1).Guidance\n9.5.1.(1).Guidance.1. Under Rule ‎9.1.1(2), the principles apply, unless otherwise stated, only to the Representative Office in the ADGM and not to the institution as a whole.\n9.5.1.(1).Guidance.2. The Principles for Representative Offices have the status of Rules and are a general statement of fundamental regulatory requirements which apply alongside the other Rules including in relation to new or unforeseen situations which may not be covered elsewhere by a specific Rule. Rules in other areas of this Rulebook build upon these fundamental principles. Consequently the Rules and Guidance elsewhere should not be seen as exhausting the implications of the Principles.\n9.5.1.(1).Guidance.3. Breaching a Principle for Representative Offices makes a Representative Office liable to disciplinary action, and may indicate that it is no longer fit and proper to carry on a Regulated Activity or to hold a Financial Services Permission. The Regulator may consider withdrawing the Financial Services Permission on that basis.\n9.5.1.(1).Guidance.4. The onus will be on the Regulator to show that the Representative Office has been at fault in some way, taking into account the standard of conduct required under the Principle in question.\n\n9.6 Principles for Representative Offices\n\n9.6.1 Principle 1 - Integrity. A Representative Office must observe high standards of integrity and fair dealing.\n\n9.6.2 Principle 2 – Due skill, care and diligence. In conducting its business activities a Representative Office must act with due skill, care and diligence.\n\n9.6.3 Principle 3 – Resources. A Representative Office must maintain and be able to demonstrate the existence of adequate resources to conduct and manage its affairs.\n\n9.6.4 Principle 4 – Relations with Regulators. A Representative Office must deal with\n\n7\nstandards of corporate governance: An Authorised Person must have a corporate governance framework as appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its business and structure, which is adequate to promote the sound and prudent management and oversight of the Authorised Person's business and to protect the interests of its Customers and stakeholders.\n\n2.2.11.Guidance\n2.2.11.Guidance.1 Corporate governance framework encompasses structural and procedural arrangements such as systems, policies and practices that are put in place to promote good governance and include the specific measures required under Rule ‎3.3.41.\n\n2.2.12 Principle 12 – Remuneration practices: An Authorised Person must have a Remuneration structure and strategies which are well aligned with the long term interests of the Authorised Person, and are appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its business.\n\n2.3 Principles for Approved Persons– application\n2.3.1 The six Principles for Approved Persons set out in Rule ‎2.4 apply to every Approved Person and in respect of every Controlled Function.\n\n2.3.1.Guidance\n2.3.1.Guidance.1. The Principles for Approved Persons do not apply to an Approved Person in respect of any other functions they may carry out, although their conduct in those functions may be relevant to their fitness and propriety.\n\n2.3.1.Guidance.2. Breaching a Principle for Approved Persons makes an Approved Person liable to disciplinary action and may indicate that they are no longer fit and proper to perform a Controlled Function, and the Regulator, may consider suspending or withdrawing Approved Person status on that basis.\n\n2.3.1.Guidance.3. In those circumstances, the onus is on the Regulator to show that the Approved Person is culpable, taking into account the standard of conduct required under the Principle in question. In determining whether or not the particular conduct of an Approved Person complies with the Principles for Approved Persons, the Regulator will take account of whether that conduct is consistent with the requirements and standards relevant to\n\n7\nlaws and apply to Authorised Persons. Additional disclosure requirements also apply if they are listed companies. The requirements in this Rulebook are tailored to Authorised Persons and are designed to augment and not to exclude the application of those requirements.\n\n3.3.41.(3).Guidance.3. Whilst Rule ‎3.3.41 deals with two aspects of corporate governance, the requirements included in other provisions under Rules ‎3.2 and ‎3.3 also go to the heart of sound corporate governance by promoting prudent and sound management of the Authorised Person’s business in the interest of its Customers and stakeholders. These requirements together are designed to promote sound corporate governance practices in Authorised Persons whilst also providing a greater degree of flexibility for Authorised Persons in establishing and implementing a corporate governance framework that are both appropriate and practicable to suit their operations.\n\n3.3.41.(3).Guidance.4. Stakeholder groups of an Authorised Person, who would benefit from the sound and prudent management of Authorised Persons, can be varied but generally encompass its owners (e.g. its shareholders), Customers, creditors, Counterparties and Employees, whose interests may not necessarily be mutually coextensive. A key objective in enhancing corporate governance standards applicable to Authorised Persons is to ensure that they are soundly and prudently managed, with the primary regard being had to its Customers.\n\n3.3.41.(3).Guidance.5. Proportionate application to Authorised Persons depending on the nature of their business: One of the key considerations that underpins how the corporate governance requirements set out in Rule ‎3.3.41 apply to an Authorised Person is the nature, scale and complexity of the Authorised Person's business, and its organisational structure.\n\n3.3.41.(3).Guidance.6. While requiring Banks, Insurers and dealers to have more detailed and complex corporate governance systems and controls, simpler systems and procedures could be required for other Authorised Persons, depending on the nature and scale of their Regulated Activities.

Adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital purposes. Bearing in mind that the assumptions made in relation to calculating VaR may not be consistent with the Authorised Person's ability to sell or hedge out less liquid positions, where appropriate, Authorised Persons should take an adjustment to the current valuation of these positions, and review their continued appropriateness on an on going basis.

Independent price verification. Independent price verification entails a higher standard of accuracy in that the market prices or model inputs are used to determine profit and loss figures, whereas daily marks are used primarily for management reporting in between reporting dates. For independent price verification, where pricing sources are more subjective, e.g. only one available broker quote, prudent measures such as valuation adjustments may be appropriate.\n\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.8. Valuation adjustments. As part of their procedures for marking to market, Authorised Persons should establish and maintain procedures for considering valuation adjustments. The Regulator expects Authorised Persons using third party valuations to consider whether valuation adjustments are necessary. Such considerations are also necessary when marking to model.\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.9. Valuation adjustments. The Regulator expects the following valuation adjustments to be formally considered at a minimum: unearned credit spreads, close out costs, Operational Risks, early termination, investing and funding costs, and future administrative costs and, where appropriate, model risk.\n\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.10.

These factors may include, but are not limited to, the amount of time it would take to hedge out the position/risks within the position, the average volatility of bid/offer spreads, the availability of independent market quotes (number and identity of market makers), the average and volatility of trading volumes (including trading volumes during periods of market stress), market concentrations, the aging of positions, the extent to which valuation relies on marking to model, and the impact of other model risks not included in Guidance note 10.\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.13. Adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital purposes. For complex products including, but not limited to, securitisation Exposures and nth to default Credit Derivatives, Authorised Persons which are approved to use models to calculate Market Risk should explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments to reflect two forms of model risk: the model risk associated with using a possibly incorrect valuation methodology; and the risk associated with using unobservable (and possibly incorrect) calibration parameters in the valuation model.\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.14. Adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital purposes.

This includes clearly defined responsibilities of the various areas involved in the determination of the valuation, sources of market information and review of their appropriateness, guidelines for the use of unobservable inputs reflecting the Authorised Person's assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the position, frequency of independent valuation, timing of closing prices, procedures for adjusting valuations, end of the month and ad hoc verification procedures; and\nb.\tclear and independent (i.e. independent of front office) reporting lines for the department accountable for the valuation process. The reporting line should ultimately be to a main board executive Director or equivalent.\nValuation methodologies\n\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.3. Marking to market. Marking to market is at least the daily valuation of positions at readily available close out prices in orderly transactions that are sourced independently. Examples of readily available close out prices include exchange prices, screen prices, or quotes from several independent reputable brokers.\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.4. Marking to market. Authorised Persons should mark to market as much as possible. The more prudent side of bid/offer should be used unless the institution is a significant market maker in a particular position type and it can close out at mid market. Authorised Persons should maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs when estimating fair value using a valuation technique. However, observable inputs or transactions may not be relevant, such as in a forced liquidation or distressed sale, or transactions may not be observable, such as when markets are inactive. In such cases, the observable data should be considered, but may not be determinative.\n\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.5. Marking to Model. Only where marking to market is not possible should Authorised Persons mark to model, but in such cases, the Authorised Person should be able to demonstrate to the Regulator that the approach is prudent. Marking to model\n\n13\navailable, generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular products should be used as far as possible;\nd.\twhere the model is developed by the Authorised Person itself, it should be based on appropriate assumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process. The model should be developed or approved independently of the front office. It should be independently tested. This includes validating the mathematics, the assumptions and the software implementation;\ne.\tthere should be formal change control procedures in place and a secure copy of the model should be held and periodically used to check valuations;\nf.\trisk management should be aware of the weaknesses of the models used and how best to reflect those in the valuation output;\ng.\tthe model should be subject to periodic review to determine the accuracy of its performance (e.g. assessing continued appropriateness of the assumptions, analysis of profit and loss versus risk factors, comparison of actual close out values to model outputs); and\nh.\tvaluation adjustments should be made as appropriate, for example, to cover the uncertainty of the model valuation (see also valuation adjustments in Guidance notes 6 to 14.)\n\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.6. Independent price verification. Independent price verification is distinct from daily mark to market. It is the process by which market prices or model inputs are regularly verified for accuracy. While daily marking to market may be performed by dealers, verification of market prices or model inputs should be performed by a unit independent of the dealing room, at least monthly (or, depending on the nature of the market/trading activity, more frequently). It need not be performed as frequently as daily mark to market, since the objective, i.e. independent, marking of positions should reveal any error or bias in pricing, which should result in the elimination of inaccurate daily marks.\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.7. Independent price verification. Independent price verification entails\n\n13\nfair value using a valuation technique. However, observable inputs or transactions may not be relevant, such as in a forced liquidation or distressed sale, or transactions may not be observable, such as when markets are inactive. In such cases, the observable data should be considered, but may not be determinative.\n\nAPP2.A2.5.Guidance.5. Marking to Model. Only where marking to market is not possible should Authorised Persons mark to model, but in such cases, the Authorised Person should be able to demonstrate to the Regulator that the approach is prudent. Marking to model is defined as any valuation which has to be benchmarked, extrapolated or otherwise calculated from a market input. When marking to model, an extra degree of conservatism is appropriate. The Regulator will consider the following in assessing whether a mark to model valuation is prudent:\na.\tsenior management should be aware of the elements of the Trading Book or of other fair valued positions which are subject to mark to model and should understand the materiality of the uncertainty this creates in the reporting of the risk/performance of the business;\nb.\tmarket inputs should be sourced, to the extent possible, in line with market prices (as discussed above). The appropriateness of the market inputs for the particular position being valued should be reviewed regularly;\nc.\twhere available, generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular products should be used as far as possible;\nd.\twhere the model is developed by the Authorised Person itself, it should be based on appropriate assumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process.

A set of well-defined and documented access management procedures should be in place. All service level agreements should be reviewed annually for serviceability and security of the systems and related operations as per the IT policies of the Authorised Person. A ‘clear roles and responsibilities matrix’ should be in place to delineate operations of a service provider from those of an Authorised Person. Physical access to systems should be limited to the relevant personnel and access should be monitored by the Authorised Person on an ongoing basis.\n\n86) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nThird party outsourcing\nAuthorised Persons are required to retain and be in the position to retrieve the data held on a cloud platform for such duration as they are required to under ADGM/FSRA record keeping purposes, and submit the data held on a cloud platform to the FSRA, as and when directed to do so, with immediate effect.\n\n87) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nThird party outsourcing\nAuthorised Persons who employ cloud based data\n\n1\nbe in place to verify the authenticity of any official government identification document and the actual customer. A Relevant Person should also apply guidance on technical standards for biometric authentication issued by the Regulator or a competent authority of the U.A.E., as applicable.\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.9. When employing an eKYC System to assist with CDD, a Relevant Person should:\na.\tensure that it has a thorough understanding of the eKYC System itself and the risks of eKYC, including those outlined by relevant guidance from FATF and other international standard setting bodies;\nb.\tcomply with all the Rules of the Regulator relevant to eKYC including, but not limited to, applicable requirements regarding the business risk assessment, as per Rule ‎6.1, and outsourcing, as per Rule ‎9.3;\nc.\tcombine eKYC with transaction monitoring, anti-fraud and cyber-security measures to support a wider framework preventing applicable Financial Crime; and\nd.\ttake appropriate steps to identify, assess and mitigate the risk of the eKYC system being misused for the purposes of Financial Crime.\n8.3.2.Guidance on CDD.10. In undertaking CDD, a Relevant Person that is a Recognised Body should have regard to the provisions of the Market Infrastructure Rulebook (“MIR”) requiring appropriate measures be taken to prevent money laundering, Market Abuse and Financial Crime, including those set out at MIR 2.8.5(c) and MIR 2.9.\n8.3.3\n8.3.3.(1) For the purposes of Rule ‎8.3.1(1)(b), and subject to (4), a Relevant Person must identify the Beneficial Owners of a Body Corporate in accordance with this Rule.\n8.3.3.(2) The Relevant Person must identify any Natural Person who:\n(a)\towns or controls (in each case whether directly or indirectly) 25% or more of the shares or voting rights in the Body Corporate;\n(b)\tcontrols the Body Corporate; or\n(c)\texercises ultimate control over the management of the Body Corporate.\n8.3.3.(3) For the purposes of (2)(b), a Natural Person controls a Body Corporate if such person:\n(a)\tholds, directly or indirectly:\n(i)\t25% or more of\n\n19\nrelevant compliance activities internally (and not be able to rely on their ‘members’ for such purposes).\n\nvi.\tDepending on the model, controls and criteria to be adopted by an MTF, the class order modification or waiver relief granted by the FSRA to Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities using Virtual Assets as referred to in paragraph 112 of the Guidance may apply.\n\nRulebook(s)\n\nvii.\tFurther to MIR Rule 2.8, the FSRA expects an MTF to have a rulebook(s) in place.  This rulebook should be clearly labelled as such and be publicly available on the website of the MTF.\n\nviii.\tSupporting documents such as participation agreements, terms of business, product lists, user guides and technical specifications are also a key part of the operation of an MTF, and should be consistent with its rulebook.  The FSRA does not consider that the existence of these documents alone meet the requirement of having a transparent and effective rulebook.  The FSRA considers it good practice that these supporting documents are available and transparent, alongside the published rulebook, to the extent possible.\n\nix.\tThe content of a rulebook  should enable an MTF to demonstrate how it is complying with MIR Rule 2.8, be supported by procedures that are complete and clear, and all in support of an MTF seeking to ensure that behaviour within its market is fair and orderly.\n\nx.\tThe FSRA expects MTFs to require explicit acknowledgement via a user agreement, that participants have read, understood and will abide by the rulebook at all times.\n\nxi.\tThe FSRA expects an MTF to undertake regular reviews of its rulebook to ensure it is consistent with relevant regulatory and legislative requirements.  Best practice may see such activity undertaken no less than every twelve-months.\n\nd)\tMIR Rule 2.9 (Financial crime and market abuse):  MTFs are required to operate an effective market surveillance program to identify, monitor,\n\n19\nof an MTF be appropriately budgeted and accounted for, including specific controls for when it has Clients that are institutional Clients (as the current conventional Member/institutional client global regulatory model may not properly account for, and mitigate, the risks relevant to operating such model within the Virtual Asset space).  For example, where an MTF has institutional Clients that are regulated as Authorised Persons (for example, an Authorised Person that is a broker / dealer) within ADGM, the MTF may take comfort from the fact that its Clients are appropriately regulated (including for AML purposes).  An MTF may not, however, take such comfort when its institutional Clients may come from unregulated/less regulated jurisdictions. MTFs with an institutional Client base will therefore need to demonstrate how the MTF will adequately comply with the requirements of the AML Rulebook where its institutional Clients are trading on behalf of further clients.\n\nv.\tGiven the current lack of global regulation of Virtual Asset intermediaries, those MTFs operating a ‘membership model’ will need to assess whether their members are adequately regulated in their home jurisdiction, such that the MTF can suitably rely on their Members, for example, to undertake CDD/AML checks.  Where members are not properly regulated, the FSRA expects that MTFs will centralise the relevant compliance activities internally (and not be able to rely on their ‘members’ for such purposes).\n\nvi.\tDepending on the model, controls and criteria to be adopted by an MTF, the class order modification or waiver relief granted by the FSRA to Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities using Virtual Assets as referred to in paragraph 112 of the Guidance may apply.\n\nRulebook(s)\n\nvii.\tFurther to MIR Rule 2.8, the FSRA expects an MTF to have a rulebook(s) in place.  This rulebook should be clearly labelled as such and be publicly available on the website\n\n19\nbut if not the MTF/Virtual Asset Custodian would need to satisfy the FSRA that it has proper systems and controls in place.  An MTF/Virtual Asset Custodian would therefore need to allow/onboard only suitable third-party NFT registries and relevant auction houses, outside of themselves.\n\n171) APPLICATION PROCESS\nApplicants seeking to become an Authorised Person conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets must be prepared to engage heavily with the FSRA throughout the application process.  The Application process is broadly broken down into five stages, as follows:\n\na)\tDue Diligence & Discussions with FSRA team(s);\n\nb)\tSubmission of Formal Application;\n\nc)\tGranting of In Principle Approval;\n\nd)\tGranting of Final Approval; and\n\ne)\t‘Operational Launch’ Testing.\n\n172) APPLICATION PROCESS\nDue diligence and Discussions with FSRA team(s)\nPrior to the submission of an Application, all Applicants are expected to provide the FSRA with a clear explanation of their proposed business model and to demonstrate how the Applicant will meet all applicable FSRA Rules and requirements. These sessions will also involve the Applicants providing a number of in-depth technology demonstrations, across all aspects of its proposed Virtual Asset activities.  The FSRA generally expects these meetings, where possible, to take place between the Applicant and the FSRA in person.  Given the complexity of the activities associated with the Virtual Asset Framework, it is likely that a number of meetings will need to be held between an Applicant and the FSRA before the Applicant will be in a position to submit a draft, then formal, application.\n\n173) APPLICATION PROCESS\nSubmission of Formal Application\nFollowing discussions with the FSRA, and upon the FSRA having reasonable comfort that the Applicant’s proposed business processes, technologies and capabilities are at a sufficiently advanced stage, the Applicant will be required to submit a completed Virtual Asset Application Form, and supporting documents, to the FSRA .  The Applicant’s supporting documents include the submission\n\n19\nand controls):  MIR Rule 2.6.1 requires an MTF to ‘establish a robust operational risk management framework with appropriate systems and controls to identify, monitor and manage operational risks that key participants, other [MTFs], service providers (including outsourcees) and utility providers might pose to itself.’\n\ni.\tIn relation to systems and controls, the FSRA has provided guidance on what it expects in relation to technology governance controls in paragraphs 47 to 92 of this Guidance.  The FSRA therefore requires an MTF to undertake its ‘MTF’ activities in compliance with these operational system and control requirements, in combination with the technology governance controls outlined earlier in this Guidance.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA expects an MTF to undertake extensive due diligence and testing of its operational systems and controls, with the relevant reports of such testing capable of being provided to the FSRA for review.  Such testing should be undertaken by an officer of the MTF possessing appropriate skills and experience.  The testing reports need to confirm the robustness of the MTF’s systems and address any potential areas of failure.  Testing should include the settlement processes for the movement of Virtual Assets between wallets, and the general connectivity of the MTF’s systems with other parties.  Testing should be ongoing, building in processes for the introduction of new Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\niii.\tAn MTF will need to provide policies and procedures that clearly evidence how it will effectively address a failure of its systems.  Failures must be rectified as soon as practicable, with an MTF’s business continuity plan including detailed and realistic response timeframes for failures or disruptions.\n\nb)\tMIR Rules 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 (Transaction recording):  FSRA expects that the primary ledger technology systems and controls of an MTF (whether they be DLT or multiple-ledger technologies) will be such that transaction recording and reporting is\n\n19\nprohibitions on the receipt of cash other than from bank accounts, and prohibitions on receiving funds from third parties. In all cases, Authorised Persons will need to clearly demonstrate to the FSRA how their controls suitably mitigate the risks of cash transactions within their operations. Considering the wider consumer protection implications, the FSRA also considers it unlikely to be appropriate for Authorised Persons to accept deposits by way of credit card or credit facilities/credit lines.\n\nbb)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nFSRA expects all Authorised Persons to exercise due care, to the utmost extent possible, in their day-to-day operations and when dealing with Clients or potential Clients.  An Authorised Person’s activities are expected to be in compliance with the AML Rules, ensuring that their activities do not pose a regulatory risk or reputational damage to the ADGM Financial System.\n\n46) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nInternational Tax Reporting Obligations\nCOBS Rule 17.4 requires Authorised Persons to consider and, if applicable, adhere to their tax reporting obligations including, as applicable, under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) and the ADGM Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017.\n\n47) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nTechnology Governance and Controls\nWhile the FSRA adopts a technology-neutral approach to the regulation of Authorised Persons, Virtual Asset technology is widely considered to be in its early years of development and usage at scale. While it does not seek to regulate Virtual Asset technologies directly, the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to meet particular requirements in terms of their technology systems, governance and controls.\n\n48) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nTechnology Governance and Controls\nHistorically, Virtual Asset\n\n1\nwould reasonably be expected to be notified.\n12.1.6.Guidance\n12.1.6.Guidance.1. The individual appointed as the deputy MLRO need not apply for the Regulator’s approval.\n12.1.6.Guidance.2. A Relevant Person should make adequate arrangements to ensure that it remains in compliance with the AML Rulebook in the event that its MLRO is absent. Adequate arrangements would include appointing a temporary MLRO for the period of the MLRO's absence or making sure that the Relevant Person's AML/TFS systems and controls allow it to continue to comply with these Rules when the MLRO is absent.\n12.1.7 A Relevant Person may outsource the role of MLRO to an individual outside the Relevant Person provided that the individual under the outsourcing agreement is and remains suitable to perform the MLRO role.\n12.1.7.Guidance \nWhere a Relevant Person outsources specific AML/TFS tasks of its MLRO to another individual or a third-party provider, including the case where they are within its corporate Group, the Relevant Person remains responsible for ensuring that the duties undertaken by the MLRO ensure its compliance with the requirements in the AML Rulebook. The Relevant Person should satisfy itself of the suitability of anyone who acts for it in the role of MLRO.\n12.2 Qualities of an MLRO\n12.2.1 A Relevant Person must ensure that its MLRO has:\n(a)\tdirect access to the Governing Body and its Senior Management;\n(b)\tsufficient and up-to-date qualifications and experience to fulfil the role;\n(c)\tsufficient resources including, if necessary, an appropriate number of appropriately trained Employees to assist in the performance of his duties in an effective, objective and independent manner;\n(d)\ta level of seniority and independence within the Relevant Person to enable him to act on his own authority;\n(e)\ttimely and unrestricted access to information the Relevant Person has about the financial and business circumstances of a customer or any Person on whose behalf the customer is or has been acting sufficient to\u003C/s\u003E\u003Cs\u003E[INST] You are a regulatory compliance and legal expert reviewing regulatory documents.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 General\n1.1.1 This document is called the Guidance and Policies Manual (“GPM”). The GPM is for information purposes only and explains how we may regulate and supervise financial services firms and markets that operate in ADGM. The GPM has purposely been written in plain English. The GPM contains guidance on:\n(a)\tour regulatory policies;\n(b)\tour risk-based approach to authorisation, supervision and enforcement; and\n(c)\twhat we consider and take into account when exercising our powers.\n1.1.2 The GPM is meant to assist persons operating or intending to operate financial services or a market in the ADGM and should be read in conjunction with FSMR and the associated Rulebooks.\n1.1.3 The GPM is not meant to be all of our guidance and policies on how we will operate and exercise our powers and we are not bound to follow it on all occasions. It is merely an informative document, which sets how we may act when exercising our powers.\n1.2 Defined terms\n1.2.1 Where we have used a defined term in the GPM, these are identified by the capitalisation of the word or a phrase capitalised. You can find the meanings of these defined terms in the Glossary module of the Rulebooks (GLO). There are also defined terms in FSMR. If there is no capitalisation of the initial letter, the word or phrase has its normal everyday meaning.\n1.2.2 When we refer to ‘legislation’ in GPM, unless the context requires otherwise, we mean laws, regulations and rules or equivalent legislative and regulatory instruments. References to a ‘person’ can mean a natural or legal person or both, depending on the context.\n1.3 Updating the GPM\n1.3.1 We will make amendments to the GPM when we make changes in our policies or processes to ensure it remains current.\n1.4 Our mandate\n1.4.1 We are committed to fostering, promoting and maintaining a fair, efficient and responsive regulatory\n\n27\ntaking into account the parent's activities.\n\n3.2.9 Branch of a non-ADGM firm . A firm carrying on Regulated Activities through a Branch will be subject to supervision by both us and the regulator in its head office jurisdiction.\n3.2.10 Branch of a non-ADGM firm . We will have regard to any lead or consolidated prudential supervision arrangements to which a firm is subject. We may place appropriate reliance on a firm's lead regulator in another jurisdiction and, where appropriate, its consolidated prudential regulator if we are satisfied that it meets appropriate regulatory criteria and standards. Where a firm is subject to lead regulation arrangements with a foreign regulator, we will usually not seek to impose consolidated prudential supervision on the firm's Group.\n3.2.11 Branch of a non-ADGM firm . In determining the level of regulatory and supervisory oversight required for a specific firm, we will consider:\n(a)\tthe degree of home country regulation and supervision by the home regulator;\n(b)\tthe fitness and propriety of the head office and its Controllers;\n(c)\tthe strength of support, both financial and managerial, which the head office is capable of providing to the branch, taking into account the branch's activities and the adequacy of, among other things, the corporate governance framework and practices at the head office; and\n(d)\tthe risk and control mechanisms within the Branch itself.\n3.2.12 Branch of a non-ADGM firm . Based on this assessment, we may consider granting a waiver or modification notice in respect of specific prudential or other regulatory requirements relating to a Branch.\n\n3.2.13 Periodic returns for Firms. A firm is required to submit periodic returns. In addition, a firm may be required to submit copies of its Group's annual interim and audited accounts. We may also require a firm to provide copies of Group returns which are sent to any other regulator.\n3.2.14 Periodic returns for Firms.

Comprehensively addressing these areas and detailing how the key risks will be identified, monitored and controlled will significantly assist us in determining applications from a start-up.\n\n2.6 Application for carrying out a Regulated Activity with or for a Retail Client\n2.6.1 GEN 5.2.3 outlines the requirements to be met by an applicant intending to carry on a Regulated Activity where the client is a Retail Client.\n2.6.2 When assessing an application of this type we will consider the following:\n(a)\tthe adequacy of an applicant's systems and controls for carrying on Regulated Activities with a Retail Client;\n(b)\twhether the applicant is able to demonstrate that its systems and controls (including policies and procedures) adequately provide for, among other things, compliance with the requirements specifically dealing with Retail Clients under the Conduct of Business Rulebook (COBS), in particular:\n(i)\tmarketing materials;\n(ii)\tthe content requirements for Client Agreements;\n(iii)\tthe suitability assessment for recommending\n\n27\nin applying for a Financial Services Permission to conduct Regulated Activities in the ADGM. It sets out the information required to support an application and what criteria we may consider in the authorisation process. Start-ups, as with any applicants, will be required to satisfy all of our requirements prior to being granted a Financial Services Permission.\n2.5.2 What are \"start-up” entities? A start-up entity is:\n(a)\tany newly set up business entity that is not part of a group that is subject to financial services regulation; or\n(b)\tpart of an existing business entity that it, or whose group, is not subject to financial services regulation.\n2.5.3 What are \"start-up” entities? As a general position, we will not usually accept applications for start-up banks or insurers however each application will be considered on its merits. We will take into account such factors as the applicant’s financial position, systems and controls and whether the start-up entity is managed by persons who have the necessary expertise and knowledge to conduct such activities.\n\n\n2.5.4 Our risk-based approach to start-ups. Any consideration of an application for the granting of a Financial Services Permission to carry on a Regulated Activity is likely to involve an assessment of the risks posed to our objectives by the proposed Regulated Activity. Whilst the broad categories of risks for all applicants will be the same, the nature of those risks within start-ups can be amplified, as a start-up does not have a regulatory track record to deal with risks upon which we may place reliance. In the case of a new business, even where senior management has substantial experience and relevant competence in the business sector, this does not necessarily imply an ability to create and sustain an adequate management control environment and compliance culture, particularly when faced with all the other issues of establishing a\n\n27\nwhere we consider that the Authorised Person has committed a contravention of FSMR.\n7.4.2 The power to suspend, limit or restrict an Authorised Person’s Financial Services Permission is a disciplinary measure that we may use (in addition to, or as an alternative to, other disciplinary or regulatory actions) for the purpose of promoting high standards of regulatory and market conduct in the ADGM through specific and generic deterrence, and by demonstrating the benefits of compliant behaviour to the financial services industry.  It may also be used for protective purposes if we consider an Authorised Person presents a risk to the ADGM financial services industry.\n7.5 Power to suspend Approval of an Approved Person\n7.5.1 In addition to the power to withdraw or vary an Approved Person’s Approval (see paragraph 5.6), under section 233(2) of FSMR, we may suspend, for such period as we consider appropriate, an Approval given in relation to the performance of a Controlled Function. The Regulator may exercise this power in circumstances where it considers that the Approved Person has committed a contravention of FSMR.\n7.5.2 The power to suspend an Approved Person’s Approval concerning the performance of a Controlled Function is a disciplinary measure which we may use (in addition to, or as an alternative to, other disciplinary or regulatory actions) for the purpose of promoting high standards of regulatory and market conduct in the ADGM through specific and generic deterrence, and by demonstrating the benefits of compliant behaviour to the financial services industry. It may also be used for protective purposes if we consider an Approved Person presents a risk to the ADGM financial services industry.\n7.6 Prohibition Orders\n7.6.1 We may make a Prohibition Order if it appears to us that an individual is not a fit and proper person to perform any function in relation to a Regulated\n\n27\nbranch into the ADGM, we will take into account where the applicant’s head office is located.\n\n2.2.8 Ownership and Group. In relation to the ownership and Group structure of an applicant, we may have regard to:\n(a)\tthe applicant’s position within its group, including any other relationships that may exist between the applicant, controllers, associates and other persons that may be considered a close link;\n(b)\tthe financial strength of the Group and its implications for the applicant;\n(c)\twhether the Group has a structure which makes it possible to:\n(i)\texercise effective supervision;\n(ii)\texchange information among regulators who supervise group members; and\n(iii)\tdetermine the allocation of responsibility among the relevant regulators;\n(d)\tany information provided by other regulators or third parties in relation to the applicant or any entity within its Group; and\n(e)\twhether the applicant or its group is subject to any adverse effect or considerations arising from a country or countries of incorporation, establishment and operations of any member of its group. In considering these matters, we may also have regard to the type and level of regulatory oversight in the relevant country or countries of the group members and the regulatory infrastructure and adherence to internationally held conventions.\n\n2.2.9 Controllers. In relation to the controllers of an applicant, we may, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of the firm's business and organisation, have regard to:\n(a)\tthe background, history and principal activities of the applicant’s controllers, including that of the controller's directors, partners or other officers associated with the applicant, and the degree of influence that they are, or may be, able to exert over the applicant and/or its activities;\n(b)\twhere the Controller will exert significant management influence over the applicant, the reputation and experience of the controller or any individual within the controller;\n(c)\tthe financial strength of a controller and its implications for the applicant’s ability to ensure the sound and prudent\n\n27\nparticular attention may be given to the clarity and the verifiable source of the initial capital funding.\n\n2.5.8 Governance risk. All applicants are required to demonstrate robust governance arrangements together with the fitness and integrity of all controllers, directors and senior management. We are aware that management control, in smaller start-ups especially, may lie with one or two dominant individuals who may also be amongst the owners of the firm. In such circumstances, we would expect the key business and control functions (i.e., risk management, compliance and internal audit) to be subject to appropriate oversight arrangements which reflect the size and complexity of the business. Applicants can assist us by describing in detail the ownership structure, high-level controls and clear reporting lines which demonstrate adequate segregation of duties.\n2.5.9 Governance risk. We may request details of the background, history and ownership of the start-up and, where applicable, its Group. Similar details relating to the background, history and other interests of the directors of the start-up may also be required. Where it considers it necessary to do so, we may undertake independent background checks on such material. A higher degree of due diligence will apply to individuals involved in a start-up and there would be an expectation that the start-up itself will have conducted detailed background checks, which may then be verified by us.\n\n\n2.5.10 Business/operational risk. All applicants are required to establish appropriate systems and controls to demonstrate that the affairs of the firm are managed and controlled effectively. The nature of the systems and controls may depend on the nature, size and complexity of the business. A start-up may wish to consider which additional systems and controls may be appropriate in the initial period of operation following launch, such as increased risk or compliance monitoring. Due to the unproven track record of\n\n27\nto be agreed upon by us, the Recognised Body itself and other relevant regulators.\n3.4.4 Group supervision. Effective co-operation with regulators will provide for prompt exchange of information and co-operation in relation to supervision and enforcement between jurisdictions. This may include exchanges of information and co-operation in respect of activities conducted by a Recognised Body. Usually, co-operation arrangements will be in the form of memoranda of understanding. The information exchange will enhance our understanding of the operations of the Group and the impact (if any) on the Recognised Body.\n\n3.4.5 Application for a change in control. GEN 8.8 sets out the requirements relating to a change in control. See also paragraphs 3.2.21 to 3.2.25.\n\n3.5 Confidentiality\n3.5.1 When carrying out our regulatory functions, we must maintain confidentiality of information, unless disclosure is permitted by section 199 of FSMR.  We have issued a separate policy statement on Confidentiality and it is available on our website under the guidance and policy statements section:  https://www.adgm.com/legal-framework/guidance-and-policy-statements?tab=2.\n3.5.2 For our general approach to publicity in certain circumstances, see Chapter 10.\n\n\n\n4. WAIVERS AND MODIFICATIONS\n4.1 Introduction\n4.1.1 Chapter 2 of FSMR provides for the modification or waiver of Rules by us.\n4.1.2 This Chapter outlines our approach to evaluating applications to grant relief from the requirements imposed by the Rules, by either waiving or modifying the application of one or more Rules. Our powers to waive or modify the requirements imposed by legislation do not extend to regulations such as FSMR.\n4.1.3 To waive the application of a Rule is to give relief to a person from the entire obligation contained in that Rule. A modification can either modify the way in which a person can comply with an obligation in a Rule or can give relief from part of the obligation in a Rule. A detailed description of the process to seek\n\n27\nother regulatory authorities.\n6.3.7 Complaints. All complaints submitted to us are held in confidence in accordance with the confidentiality requirements of FSMR as set out in section 3.5 of this manual. However, in order to assess a complaint properly, we may need to speak to third parties including other regulatory authorities or the subject of the complaint. Where it is the subject of the complaint, we will endeavour to notify the complainant of this or (if appropriate) seek their consent for us to do so.\n6.3.8 Complaints. We endeavour to complete assessments within 28 days of receipt of a complaint. However, some assessments may take longer, depending on the nature and complexity of the complaint.\n6.3.9 Complaints. We will provide each complainant with a final response when the assessment of the complaint has been completed. If, during the assessment of a regulatory complaint, we identify suspected contraventions or misconduct within our jurisdiction, we will consider whether to proceed with an investigation or take some form of regulatory action.\n\n6.3.10 Referrals. There are two types of referrals - internal and external.\nInternal referrals\n(a)\tInternal referrals usually originate from our supervisory activities. Our supervisory framework is designed to detect and mitigate risks to the ADGM and the financial services industry in the ADGM.\n(b)\tAn internal referral usually occurs where our supervision function identifies possible contraventions of our legislation and considers that the matter warrants referral to our enforcement department for further review.\n(c)\tWhen the enforcement function receives an internal referral, the referring function will continue to be responsible during the course of the investigation for the ongoing supervision of the firm that is the subject of the referral.\nExternal referrals\n(d)\tWe may also receive allegations of misconduct through an external referral from other regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies or any other person.\n(e)\tSuch allegations may be received pursuant to the IOSCO or\n\n27\nRemote Recognition Requirements as being fundamental requirements for Recognised Bodies and Remote Bodies operating under a Recognition Order.\n\n6.2.9 Decision to investigate. We will assess on a case-by-case basis whether to carry out a formal investigation pursuant to section 205 of FSMR, having considered all the available information including those factors set out in section 6.4 below.\n\n6.2.10 Enforcement process. When taking enforcement action, we will generally adopt the following process:\n(a)\tStep 1 - Assessment of complaints and referrals (section 6.3);\n(b)\tStep 2 - Commencement of an investigation (section ‎6.4);\n(c)\tStep 3 - Information gathering (section 6.5);\n(d)\tStep 4 - Analysis of information provided (section 6.7);\n(e)\tStep 5 - Assessment of remedies (section 6.8); and\n(f)\tStep 6 - Conclusion of the investigation (section 6.9).\n\n6.3 Step 1 - Assessment of complaints and referrals\n6.3.1 Assessment of complaints and referrals concerning suspected misconduct or suspected contraventions is a key function of our regulatory remit and enforcement framework. Every complaint and referral, regardless of source, is assessed to determine whether an investigation or other action ought to take place.\n\n6.3.2 Sources of complaints and referrals. We may become aware of suspected misconduct or suspected contraventions from a variety of sources, including:\n(a)\tmembers of the public;\n(b)\tour supervisory activities; and\n(c)\tother external regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies.\n\n6.3.3 Complaints. Complaints received by us from members of the public that relate to:\n(a)\tany conduct of, or dissatisfaction with, any person regulated by us;\n(b)\ta potential contravention of FSMR or Rules; or\n(c)\tany conduct that causes, or may cause, damage to the reputation of the ADGM or the financial services industry in the ADGM;\nare classified as regulatory complaints and are assessed through our complaints management function.\n6.3.4 Complaints. A person wishing to lodge a regulatory complaint with us should, where possible, do so in writing. A complaint can be lodged by:\n(a)\tusing our online complaints form that can be found at https://www.adgm.com/operating-in-adgm/additional-obligations-of-financial-services-entities/enforcement/complaints/submit-a-complaint;\n(b)\temail to: FSRA.Complaints@adgm.com;\n(c)\tsending\u003C/s\u003E\u003Cs\u003E[INST] You are a regulatory compliance and legal expert reviewing regulatory documents.

In addition to the substantial commitment of resources required, this also means that the FSRA’s regulatory oversight extends to its order book, matching engine, rulebook(s), ensuring fair and orderly markets, settlement, and for the purposes of preventing/monitoring for Market Abuse, amongst the relevant requirements set out in the Market Infrastructure Rules (“MIR”) and Chapter 8 of COBS.\n\n69) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nRIEs, MTFs and OTFs\nIn practical terms, this means that for start-up MTFs or OTFs, its entire order book and the functionality of its matching\n\n34\npowers to resolve any breach in a timely fashion, such as taking emergency action itself or by compelling the delivery and/or storage facility to take appropriate action.  The FSRA expects this to include the Authorised Person having the ability to sanction a Member, market participant or the delivery and/or storage facility for acts or omissions that compromise compliance with applicable sanctions.\n\n66) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSanctions\nPursuant to AML Rule 11.1.1(2), an Authorised Person must have arrangements in place to notify the Regulator, as soon as practicable, of any breaches, or potential breaches of applicable sanctions, as well as the actions it has taken to correct.

In June 2018, the FSRA formally implemented its Virtual Asset Regulatory Framework, which specifically included the Rules and requirements (including the Virtual Assets Guidance) applicable to Authorised Persons conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets.  The FSRA released its first update to the Virtual Assets Guidance in May 2019.\n\n10) BACKGROUND\nOn the back of the publication of these regulatory frameworks/positions, the FSRA continues to see substantial interest across the digital assets space, including the related use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms.  This interest is spread across a wide spectrum of digital asset based financial services activities, including exchanges, custody, dealing, advising, fund management, payment and other-banking related services.\n\n11) BACKGROUND\nEqually, in addition to there being interest across various digital asset-based financial services activities, there is also extensive interest spread across the various types of digital asset-related instruments (including Digital Securities, Virtual Assets, fiat tokens, Derivatives and Funds).\n\n12) BACKGROUND\nThis Guidance is intended to provide clarity to those seeking to undertake ‘Digital Securities’-related financial services activities within ADGM, including Issuers wanting to make an Offer of Digital Securities and to assist Authorised Persons conducting a a Regulated Activity\n\n33\nactivities, including exchanges, custody, dealing, advising, fund management, payment and other-banking related services.\n\n11) BACKGROUND\nEqually, in addition to there being interest across various digital asset-based financial services activities, there is also extensive interest spread across the various types of digital asset-related instruments (including Digital Securities, Virtual Assets, fiat tokens, Derivatives and Funds).\n\n12) BACKGROUND\nThis Guidance is intended to provide clarity to those seeking to undertake ‘Digital Securities’-related financial services activities within ADGM, including Issuers wanting to make an Offer of Digital Securities and to assist Authorised Persons conducting a a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets wanting to extend their digital assets/financial services activities beyond Accepted Virtual Assets. It is also intended to assist entities seeking to utilise new technologies (such as DLT) for the purposes of expanding their activities from the more ‘conventional’ Securities space into Digital Securities.\n\n13) BACKGROUND\nIn terms of Virtual Assets, the Virtual Asset Framework (including the Virtual Assets Guidance) provides clarity in relation to what is needed to undertake Virtual Asset-based financial services activity within ADGM. For readers interested in the Virtual Asset Framework, the FSRA suggests you read the Virtual Assets Guidance in the first instance.\n\n14) BACKGROUND\nThe diagram and table on the following pages set out the FSRA’s regulatory approach in relation to the different types of digital asset activities within ADGM.\n/Figure Start\nThis figure presents a classification of Digital Assets as defined and regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA), organized into four distinct categories: Other Digital Tokens, Virtual Assets, Digital Securities, and Fiat Tokens, with Derivatives/Funds being mentioned as an associated category. Below are the detailed descriptions of each:\n\nOther Digital Tokens: These are utility tokens which do not exhibit the features and characteristics of a regulated investment/instrument under FSRA.\n\nVirtual Assets: This category includes non-fiat virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, Ether, etc. The figure notes\n\n33\nObligations\nAll entities seeking to engage in Digital Securities-based financial services activities must consider and, if applicable, adhere to their tax reporting obligations including, as applicable, under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) and the ADGM Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017.\n\n\n114) DIGITAL SECURITIES – SPECIFIC REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS\nData protection obligations for Issuers\nIssuers, and other holders of client data, should familiarise themselves with the data protection obligations applying within ADGM.  Further information regarding the ADGM’s data protection requirements is addressed at paragraphs 113 - 118 of the Virtual Assets Guidance.\n\n115) DIGITAL SECURITIES – SPECIFIC REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS\nMargin trading\nEntities wishing to provide margin trading to its Clients will need to submit for approval details of the terms upon which it proposes to do so (for an Applicant, in its Application; for an Authorised Person or Recognition Order holder, as part of ongoing supervisory arrangements).  As a general position, the FSRA would only consider allowing entities with a relevant proven track record to provide margin trading.  Particular focus will be placed on the proposed leverage ratio.\n\n116) DIGITAL SECURITIES – SPECIFIC REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS\nMargin trading\nEntities that are not proposing, or permitted, to carry out margin trading will likely have a restriction from doing so placed on their FSP or Recognition Order.\n\n117) DIGITAL SECURITIES – SPECIFIC REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS\nIslamic Finance Rules\nFSRA’s Islamic Finance Rules (IFR) apply to a number of entities that can operate within ADGM, including Authorised Persons and a Person making an Offer of Securities.  As IFR is linked to the use of ‘Specified Investments’, including (Digital) Securities, IFR can apply to Authorised Persons Conducting Islamic Financial Business or offering/distributing Shari’a-compliant Securities.\n\n\n118) STABLECOINS\nThe FSRA recognises that the use of Digital Securities in ADGM may likely coincide with the use of fiat tokens.  Further clarity on FSRA’s regulatory position in relation to stablecoins\n\n33\nadvisor, fund manager or asset manager, seeking to provide its services in relation to Digital Securities (refer to paragraphs 87-92); or\n\ng)\tan Operator of a PFP seeking to market Digital Securities on its electronic platform (refer to paragraphs 93 - 96).\n\n5) INTRODUCTION\nExcept as otherwise set out, when interpreting (and demonstrating compliance with) the Rules discussed in this Guidance, readers are to interpret the Rules referenced in this Guidance (for example, in relation to the MIR, MKT, COBS, GEN and AML Rulebooks) in the way those Rules are written.  Where this Guidance cross refers to the Virtual Assets Guidance, it is the FSRA’S general expectation that readers apply those relevant aspects of the Virtual Assets Guidance in the context of Digital Securities, with such changes in terminology being read (and understood) as required.\n\n6) INTRODUCTION\nThis Guidance is not an exhaustive source of the FSRA’s policy on the exercise of its regulatory functions and powers.  The FSRA is not bound by the requirements set out in this Guidance and may:\n\na)\timpose additional requirements to address any specific risks posed by Digital Securities; and/or\n\nb)\twaive or modify any of the Rules relevant to Digital Securities, at its discretion, where appropriate.\n\n7) INTRODUCTION\nUnless otherwise defined or the context otherwise requires, the terms contained in this Guidance have the same meaning as defined in FSMR and the FSRA Glossary Rulebook (“GLO”).\n\n8) INTRODUCTION\nFor more details on the process for:\n\na)\tconducting Offers of Securities, in or from ADGM, please contact the FSRA at MIP@adgm.com;\n\nb)\trecognition as a RIE and/or Recognised Clearing House (RCH), authorisation as an MTF or authorisation as an Authorised Person Providing Custody for services as a Digital Settlement Facility  (“DSF”), please contact the FSRA at MIP@adgm.com; or\n\nc)\tauthorisation as an intermediary conducting other Digital Securities-based activities, please contact the FSRA at authorisation@adgm.com.\n\n\n9) BACKGROUND\nIn October 2017, the FSRA published its\n\n33\nto the FSRA for additional approval to trade Digital Securities.  The MTF would therefore be able to have Digital Securities admitted to trading, where such Digital Securities were directly offered/issued based on an Exempt Offer, or have already been admitted to a RIE (as the primary venue for trading - refer to paragraph 42).\n\n64) AUTHORISED PERSONS CONDUCTING A REGULATED ACTIVITY IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS – EXTENSION INTO TO DIGITAL SECURITIES ACTIVITIES\nMTFs using Virtual Assets – Extension into trading of Digital Securities\nVirtual Asset MTFs seeking to extend their operations to include Digital Securities will be required to demonstrate that they can comply with those requirements applicable to operating a MTF (e.g., COBS, MIR, GEN, AML) in the context of undertaking new Digital Securities-related financial services.  While the FSRA anticipates that the technology utilised by an MTF for the purposes of trading of Virtual Assets may be the same, or substantially similar, as that required for the purposes of trading Digital Securities, the MTF will still be required to demonstrate to the FSRA how each of the applicable Authorised Person/MTF requirements are to be met taking into account Digital Securities requirements.\n\n65) AUTHORISED PERSONS CONDUCTING A REGULATED ACTIVITY IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS – EXTENSION INTO TO DIGITAL SECURITIES ACTIVITIES\nMTFs using Virtual Assets – Extension into trading of Digital Securities\nFor the purposes of MIR Rule 3.8 (settlement), Virtual Asset MTFs seeking to extend their operations to include Digital Securities will not be permitted to clear and settle transactions within the same legal entity that is conducting MTF-trading activities.  In such circumstances, the MTF will be required to separately establish, or make arrangements to use, a separate clearing and settlement entity (refer to the sections above in relation to RCHs or DSFs, in paragraphs 53 or 59 respectively).\n\n66) AUTHORISED PERSONS\n\n33\nseeking to do so will need to demonstrate to the FSRA how they will meet the Rules applicable to Digital Securities and how either its existing technology infrastructure will be able to meet these requirements or new technology will be implemented.\n\n77) CONVENTIONAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES & DIGITAL SECURITIES\nGiven the nature of digital markets, entities can expect particular FSRA focus to be placed on their use of technology and technology governance.  Entities should familiarise themselves with the FSRA’s technology governance guidance as set out in paragraphs 51-66, 69-70 and 77-87 of the Virtual Assets Guidance (where Virtual Assets should be read as Digital Securities) which will form part of the basis for FSRA review.\n\n78) CONVENTIONAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES & DIGITAL SECURITIES\nRIEs & Digital Securities\nA RIE should engage with the FSRA at an early stage and be in a position to outline how they intend to continue to meet their obligations as an RIE in the context of Digital Securities (treated similarly to the introduction of a new asset class).  Formal approval from the FSRA will be required before an RIE can facilitate offers of, issuances in and the trading of Digital Securities.\n\n79) CONVENTIONAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES & DIGITAL SECURITIES\nRIEs & Digital Securities\nIn addition to what is separately set out in this Guidance, an RIE operating within the conventional Securities space seeking to facilitate Digital Securities offers and trading, and proposing to use new technologies such as DLT, should review and consider a number of areas of the Virtual Assets Guidance (as applicable), including the following:\n\na)\tTechnology Governance and Controls (paragraphs 47-92);\nb)\tAccepted Virtual Assets (paragraph 25, including for Security (b) and Type of DLT(e));\nc)\tCapital requirements (paragraphs 31-36);\nd)\tMargin Trading (paragraph 121); and\ne)\tSubstance requirements (paragraphs 126-128).\n\n80) CONVENTIONAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES & DIGITAL SECURITIES\nRIEs & Digital Securities\nA particular area of focus for the FSRA will be the Applicant’s\n\n33\nfactors considered to be of the greatest or most-immediate significance should be disclosed prominently at the beginning of the risk factors section.\n\nc)\tResponsibility: As per MKT Rule 4.10, an Issuer or the Person making a Prospectus Offer remains responsible for all disclosures within a Prospectus and ensuring that the disclosures within a Prospectus are clear and not misleading.\n\nd)\tGeneral Information: As set out in MKT Appendix 1.1.1-1.1, the country of incorporation of the Issuer and its incorporation number should be clearly disclosed within the Prospectus. A statement should be included on whether the Issuer has been established as a special purpose vehicle or entity for the purpose of issuing asset backed Securities.  In the context of Digital Securities, the FSRA would generally view digital representations (such as tokens) of Debentures or notes backed by financial assets to be considered asset backed for the purpose of this disclosure requirement. Please note that the disclosure requirement in Securities Note – 7.1 also applies.\n\ne)\tActual and proposed business activities: As set out in MKT Appendix 1.1.1-2.1, a description of the history of the Issuer is to be included, and where an Issuer is newly incorporated, information should be disclosed regarding any preceding entity which conducted similar operations or was controlled by the same parties.\n\nf)\tHistorical financial information: As set out in MKT Appendix 1.1.1-7.1, where an Issuer has begun operations, its relevant financial information is to be included in the Prospectus, and be appropriately audited.  An Issuer’s financial statements are to be prepared in compliance with IFRS. As set out in MKT Appendix 1.1.1-9.4, please also note that the requirement for an expert report applies to special categories of Companies.\n\ng)\tSecurities Note: For the purposes of MKT Appendix 1.2.1 – Section 2 (General information relating to the Securities (b)&(d)), in the case of Digital Securities, the\n\n33\n1) INTRODUCTION\nThis Guidance is issued under section 15(2) of the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 (“FSMR”).  It should be read in conjunction with FSMR, the relevant Rulebooks of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (“FSRA”), the FSRA’s Guidance & Policies Manual, its ‘Guidance – Regulation of Digital Security Offerings (ICOs) and Virtual Assets under the FSMR’ (“ICO Guidance”),  its ‘Guidance – Regulation of Virtual Asset Activities in ADGM’ (“Virtual Asset Guidance”) , and its ‘Guidance – Regulatory Framework for Private Financing Platforms’.\n\n2) INTRODUCTION\nThis Guidance is applicable to entities considering the use of, or using, ‘Digital Securities’ within ADGM, including activities undertaken by Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs), Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs), Issuers, Reporting Entities, Authorised Persons conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets, and Authorised Persons Providing Custody or Operating a Private Financing Platform (‘PFP’), amongst others.  The Guidance clarifies the use of Digital Securities within ADGM for both primary market and secondary market contexts.  Readers seeking clarity on the licensing requirements for activities in relation to Virtual Assets should refer to the Virtual Asset Guidance.\n\n3) INTRODUCTION\nFor the purposes of this Guidance, ‘Digital Securities’ are defined are types of digital assets that possess the features and characteristics of a Security (as defined in Schedule 1 – Part 3 of Specified Investments of FSMR).  Digital Securities also include ‘tokenised’ offerings of Securities.\n\n4) INTRODUCTION\nThis Guidance is separated into distinct chapters and is not necessarily best read from front to back.  This Guidance may be most useful to a reader who needs to understand a specific aspect of FSRA policy in relation to Digital Securities, and who may therefore wish to better understand FSRA’s regulatory treatment in the context of the reader’s individual circumstances. Examples of such specific aspects could include (but are not limited to):\n\na)\ta\u003C/s\u003E\u003Cs\u003E[INST] You are a regulatory compliance and legal expert reviewing regulatory documents.

Depending on the relevant Regulated Activities being undertaken, the FSRA expects to see substantive resources committed within ADGM across all lines of the Authorised Person’s activity, including, but not limited to, commercial, governance, compliance/surveillance, operations, technical, IT and HR functions. The FSRA expects the ‘mind and management’ of an Authorised Person to be located within ADGM.  Further discussion on substance in relation to MTFs using Virtual Assets is set out at paragraph 126.\n\n107) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nVirtual Asset Brokers or Dealers\nAuthorised Persons intending to operate solely as a broker or dealer for Clients (including the operation of an OTC broking or dealing desk) are not permitted to structure their broking / dealing service or platform in such a way that would have it be considered as operating a market / MTF using Virtual Assets. The FSRA would consider features such as allowing for price discovery, displaying a public trading order book (accessible to any member of the public, regardless of whether they are Clients), and allowing trades to automatically be matched using an exchange-type matching engine as characteristic of an MTF using Virtual Assets, and not activities acceptable for an intermediary-type Authorised Person to undertake.\n\n108) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nVirtual Asset Brokers or Dealers\nAn Authorised Person (conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets) that only has an FSP to operate as a broker / dealer and not as an MTF is required to design and structure its operations, user interface, website, marketing\n\n19\nof an MTF be appropriately budgeted and accounted for, including specific controls for when it has Clients that are institutional Clients (as the current conventional Member/institutional client global regulatory model may not properly account for, and mitigate, the risks relevant to operating such model within the Virtual Asset space).  For example, where an MTF has institutional Clients that are regulated as Authorised Persons (for example, an Authorised Person that is a broker / dealer) within ADGM, the MTF may take comfort from the fact that its Clients are appropriately regulated (including for AML purposes).  An MTF may not, however, take such comfort when its institutional Clients may come from unregulated/less regulated jurisdictions. MTFs with an institutional Client base will therefore need to demonstrate how the MTF will adequately comply with the requirements of the AML Rulebook where its institutional Clients are trading on behalf of further clients.\n\nv.\tGiven the current lack of global regulation of Virtual Asset intermediaries, those MTFs operating a ‘membership model’ will need to assess whether their members are adequately regulated in their home jurisdiction, such that the MTF can suitably rely on their Members, for example, to undertake CDD/AML checks.  Where members are not properly regulated, the FSRA expects that MTFs will centralise the relevant compliance activities internally (and not be able to rely on their ‘members’ for such purposes).\n\nvi.\tDepending on the model, controls and criteria to be adopted by an MTF, the class order modification or waiver relief granted by the FSRA to Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities using Virtual Assets as referred to in paragraph 112 of the Guidance may apply.\n\nRulebook(s)\n\nvii.\tFurther to MIR Rule 2.8, the FSRA expects an MTF to have a rulebook(s) in place.  This rulebook should be clearly labelled as such and be publicly available on the website\n\n19\nexecute and route Client’s orders and source liquidity (e.g., whether they pass or route orders to other brokers, dealers or exchanges to execute). Where a broker / dealer routes Client orders to a single liquidity source such as an MTF for execution, it must also disclose this to all Clients;\n\nb)\twhether it may carry out proprietary trading on its own account, and if so, whether it may trade against Clients’ positions;\n\nc)\tthe fees it charges Clients; and\n\nd)\thow it determines the prices of the Accepted Virtual Assets it quotes to Clients.\n\n111) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nAppointment of advisers\nApplicants should consider the appointment of compliance advisers, with the appropriate skills, knowledge and experience (taking into account the activities that the Applicant is proposing to undertake), to provide the requisite assistance to the Applicant throughout the Application process.  The FSRA expects that Applicants should engage its compliance advisers by no later than when it begins to prepare its Application, and should retain them up until the date of operational launch.\n\n112) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nCertain class order modifications / waivers\nThe FSRA appreciates that some Rules, in particular within MIR and parts of COBS, may not apply to certain Authorised Persons and the FSRA may grant class order modification and waiver relief in relation to these Rules.   To the extent that an Applicant or Authorised Person considers that any other Rules do not apply to it by virtue of its business model or otherwise, the FSRA expects that an application for modification or relief be submitted either as part of its Application or at such later date as the relief may be required.\n\n113) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nData protection obligations for Authorised Persons\nADGM’s data protection regime protects individuals’ right to privacy by controlling how\n\n19\nunless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.  The Registration Authority has designated certain jurisdictions as providing an adequate level of protection; a current list is maintained by the Registration Authority upon its website, which may be updated from time to time.\n\n118) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nData protection obligations for Authorised Persons\nIf an Authorised Person intends to transfer personal data to a recipient, including by way of storage of personal information upon a cloud based service or remote server, located in a jurisdiction other than those considered by the Registration Authority to be possessing adequate safeguards, such transfer is only possible under certain conditions, including, but not limited to, circumstances where the:\n\na)\tindividual has consented to the proposed transfer;\n\nb)\tproposed transfer is necessary for the performance of the service for which the data controller was engaged by the individual; and\n\nc)\tdata controller and data processor have entered into an approved form of agreement concerning the protection of personal data, or the Registration Authority has granted a permit consenting to the proposed transfer.\n\n119) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nTransactions with unknown counterparties\nAuthorised Persons should avoid a transactional interaction with any infrastructure or services where a counterparty is unknown or anonymous (e.g., via certain peer to peer or decentralised exchanges) at any stage of the process within and outside of the Authorised Persons’ core operations.  This is to ensure that Authorised Persons remain compliant with FSRA Rules at all times and do not unnecessarily expose their activities to risks emanating from tainted sources / destination of funds.\n\n120) SPECIFIC FSRA GUIDANCE ON THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nTransactions with unknown counterparties\nAuthorised Persons should also avoid inclusion of liquidity, pricing and settlement data\n\n19\nof the requirements across these Rules - for example, MIR Rule 2.8.5 contains substantive provisions that should apply, regardless of what model of ‘access’ an MTF (using Virtual Assets) utilises.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA recognises, however, that MTFs (using Virtual Assets) generally operate an ‘access’ model that does not include Members  (e.g., access is granted directly to (retail and institutional) Clients of the MTF).  An MTF operating in this manner will, therefore, need to ensure that it has appropriate processes, controls and rules to ‘protect the orderly functioning’ of its market, its facilities and the interests of its investors.\n\niii.\tBy not adopting a ‘Member-access’ model and allowing direct ‘Client-access’, MTFs lose one layer of regulatory/supervisory defense that Recognised Investment Exchanges and Member-access MTFs have, in that they do not have Members assisting them in the undertaking of the necessary due diligence and compliance reviews of investors being on-boarded into their market.  The FSRA, in these circumstances, requires MTFs to undertake their own CDD reviews for every client accessing (trading on) their market (something which traditionally a Recognised Investment Exchange or Member-access MTF can rely on its Members to do). Resultant AML/CFT obligations therefore fall more directly on a Client-access MTF as well.\n\niv.\tThe FSRA expects that the controls (and resultant resourcing needs) of an MTF be appropriately budgeted and accounted for, including specific controls for when it has Clients that are institutional Clients (as the current conventional Member/institutional client global regulatory model may not properly account for, and mitigate, the risks relevant to operating such model within the Virtual Asset space).  For example, where an MTF has institutional Clients that are regulated as Authorised Persons (for example, an Authorised Person that is a broker / dealer) within ADGM, the MTF may take comfort from the fact that its Clients are appropriately\n\n19\nrelevant compliance activities internally (and not be able to rely on their ‘members’ for such purposes).\n\nvi.\tDepending on the model, controls and criteria to be adopted by an MTF, the class order modification or waiver relief granted by the FSRA to Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities using Virtual Assets as referred to in paragraph 112 of the Guidance may apply.\n\nRulebook(s)\n\nvii.\tFurther to MIR Rule 2.8, the FSRA expects an MTF to have a rulebook(s) in place.  This rulebook should be clearly labelled as such and be publicly available on the website of the MTF.\n\nviii.\tSupporting documents such as participation agreements, terms of business, product lists, user guides and technical specifications are also a key part of the operation of an MTF, and should be consistent with its rulebook.  The FSRA does not consider that the existence of these documents alone meet the requirement of having a transparent and effective rulebook.  The FSRA considers it good practice that these supporting documents are available and transparent, alongside the published rulebook, to the extent possible.\n\nix.\tThe content of a rulebook  should enable an MTF to demonstrate how it is complying with MIR Rule 2.8, be supported by procedures that are complete and clear, and all in support of an MTF seeking to ensure that behaviour within its market is fair and orderly.\n\nx.\tThe FSRA expects MTFs to require explicit acknowledgement via a user agreement, that participants have read, understood and will abide by the rulebook at all times.\n\nxi.\tThe FSRA expects an MTF to undertake regular reviews of its rulebook to ensure it is consistent with relevant regulatory and legislative requirements.  Best practice may see such activity undertaken no less than every twelve-months.\n\nd)\tMIR Rule 2.9 (Financial crime and market abuse):  MTFs are required to operate an effective market surveillance program to identify, monitor,\n\n19\nonly MTFs can operate markets within ADGM that allow for the matching of orders, or for the purposes of price discovery, of Accepted Virtual Assets. For this reason, and the reasons set out above, the application of FSRA’s regulatory oversight may, therefore, be distinctly different from other regulators globally.\n\n129) MULTILATERAL TRADING FACILITIES AND VIRTUAL ASSETS\nTrading Pairs\nThe FSRA’s expectation is that an MTF’s trading pairs can only comprise of the following:\n\na)\tFiat Currency (or other value) into Accepted Virtual Assets;\n\nb)\tAccepted Virtual Assets into Fiat Currency (or other value); or\n\nc)\tOne Accepted Virtual Asset into another Accepted Virtual Asset.\n\n\n130) MULTILATERAL TRADING FACILITIES AND VIRTUAL ASSETS\nGuidance in relation to Applicable Rules\nIn addition to the MTF Rules set out in COBS Chapter 8, MTFs are also required to meet the requirements set out in COBS Rules 17.1 to 17.6, and the additional Rules set out in COBS 17.7.\n\n131) MULTILATERAL TRADING FACILITIES AND VIRTUAL ASSETS\nGuidance in relation to Applicable Rules\nChapter 8 of COBS incorporates Rules from various other FSRA Rulebooks that must be complied with, including certain sections of MIR. COBS Rule 8.2.1 sets out various Rules in MIR that MTFs (using Virtual Assets) are required to comply with to the satisfaction of the FSRA, with the applicable Rules set out as follows:\n\na)\tMIR Rule 2.6 (Operational systems and controls):  MIR Rule 2.6.1 requires an MTF to ‘establish a robust operational risk management framework with appropriate systems and controls to identify, monitor and manage operational risks that key participants, other [MTFs], service providers (including outsourcees) and utility providers might pose to itself.’\n\ni.\tIn relation to systems and controls, the FSRA has provided guidance on what it expects in relation to technology governance controls in paragraphs 47 to 92 of this Guidance.  The FSRA therefore requires an MTF to undertake its ‘MTF’ activities in compliance with these operational\n\n19\nand controls):  MIR Rule 2.6.1 requires an MTF to ‘establish a robust operational risk management framework with appropriate systems and controls to identify, monitor and manage operational risks that key participants, other [MTFs], service providers (including outsourcees) and utility providers might pose to itself.’\n\ni.\tIn relation to systems and controls, the FSRA has provided guidance on what it expects in relation to technology governance controls in paragraphs 47 to 92 of this Guidance.  The FSRA therefore requires an MTF to undertake its ‘MTF’ activities in compliance with these operational system and control requirements, in combination with the technology governance controls outlined earlier in this Guidance.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA expects an MTF to undertake extensive due diligence and testing of its operational systems and controls, with the relevant reports of such testing capable of being provided to the FSRA for review.  Such testing should be undertaken by an officer of the MTF possessing appropriate skills and experience.  The testing reports need to confirm the robustness of the MTF’s systems and address any potential areas of failure.  Testing should include the settlement processes for the movement of Virtual Assets between wallets, and the general connectivity of the MTF’s systems with other parties.  Testing should be ongoing, building in processes for the introduction of new Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\niii.\tAn MTF will need to provide policies and procedures that clearly evidence how it will effectively address a failure of its systems.  Failures must be rectified as soon as practicable, with an MTF’s business continuity plan including detailed and realistic response timeframes for failures or disruptions.\n\nb)\tMIR Rules 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 (Transaction recording):  FSRA expects that the primary ledger technology systems and controls of an MTF (whether they be DLT or multiple-ledger technologies) will be such that transaction recording and reporting is\n\n19\nRegulated Activities\nApplicants approved by the FSRA as an Authorised Person and permitted to conduct a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets will be granted an FSP for the relevant Regulated Activity being conducted by that Authorised Person. The activities of the Authorised Person when conducting its Regulated Activity will be limited such that it is only permitted to the engage in activities in relation to the use of Virtual Assets, unless it has been otherwise authorised by the FSRA. An Applicant seeking to be permitted to conduct activities in relation to Specified Investments / Financial Instruments, in addition to Virtual Assets, will need to apply to the FSRA to be able to do so, and will need to comply with the requirements of the FSRA in relation to those Specified Investments / Financial Instruments (including in relation to fees).\n\n21) FEATURES OF THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nCombination of Regulated Activities\nFor example, a person wishing to operate as a broker, dealer or custodian in the conventional space will need to apply for and receive FSRA approvals applicable to those conventional Specified Investments / Financial Instruments, in addition to seeking approval to conduct a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets.\n\n22) FEATURES OF THE VIRTUAL ASSET FRAMEWORK\nCombination of Regulated Activities\nFSP holders carrying on a Regulated Activity that incidentally involves the use of Virtual Assets may still be subject to relevant Rules in Chapter 17 of COBS (e.g., in relation to Accepted Virtual Assets, technology governance, disclosure requirements) to ensure that appropriate activity is undertaken as part of their Regulated Activities.\n\n\n23) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nConducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets\nChapter 17 of COBS applies to all Authorised Persons conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets, requiring compliance with all\u003C/s\u003E\u003Cs\u003E[INST] You are a regulatory compliance and legal expert reviewing regulatory documents.

For example, if the report/rumour simply refers to a Listed Entity being about to enter into a particular transaction with another party, without including any of the specific transaction details, the Listing Authority will generally only require the Listed Entity/Reporting Entity to Disclose the fact that it is in negotiations with that party, without the Disclosure needing to include any of the details being negotiated.\n\n92) CONFIDENTIALITY (RULE 7.2.2(2))\nOn the other hand, if the report/rumour includes specific and accurate transaction details, the Listing Authority will generally expect the Reporting Entity to Disclose those details.  If the report/rumour includes inaccurate transaction details, the Disclosure required will depend on the circumstances; in some circumstances, it may be appropriate to correct those details, while in other circumstances it may be appropriate to simply indicate that the details are inaccurate or still being negotiated.\n\n93) CONFIDENTIALITY (RULE 7.2.2(2))\nIn relation to the circumstances of paragraph 90c) above, there may be occasions where a Reporting Entity (or its advisors) wish to debate with the Listing Authority whether a sudden and significant movement in the market price and/or traded volume of a Listed Entity’s Securities can be appropriately attributed to Inside Information ceasing to be confidential.  In these circumstances, if a Reporting Entity advises the Listing Authority that there is Inside Information that has not yet been Disclosed due to reliance on Rule 7.2.2(2),  and it is not able to evidence any other event, circumstance or information which could explain the movement in the market price and/or traded volumes of the Listed Entity’s Securities, the Listing Authority will have no option but to assume that Inside Information in question has become known to some participants in\n\n28\nit provides context and will help the market in the Listed Entity’s Securities to understand the basis for, and price in, the forward looking statements.\n\n123) DISCLOSURES – SYSTEMS, CONTROLS & CONTENT\nThe contents of a Disclosure\nA Disclosure must be presented in language that is appropriate for publication.  It should be factual, relevant and expressed in a clear and objective manner.  Emotive, intemperate and defamatory language is not to be used, nor should vague or imprecise terms.\n\n124) DISCLOSURES – SYSTEMS, CONTROLS & CONTENT\nThe contents of a Disclosure\nWhere possible, a Disclosure of Inside Information under Rule 7.2.1 should contain sufficient detail for investors (or their professional advisers) to understand the ramifications of the Disclosed Inside Information, and to assess its impact on the price, or value, of the Listed Entity’s Securities.   For example, depending on the specific circumstances, a Disclosure that relates to the signing of a contract for a significant acquisition would likely include:\n\na)\tdetails of the assets proposed to be acquired;\n\nb)\tdetails of any material conditions that are required to be satisfied before the agreement becomes legally binding or proceeds to completion;\n\nc)\tinformation about the likely effect of the acquisition on the Listed Entity’s financial position including, but not limited to, total assets, total equity interests, annual revenue, annual expenditure/costs, and annual profit;\n\nd)\tif the Listed Entity is proposing to issue Securities as part of, or in conjunction with, the transaction, detailed information about the issue (including its effect on the total issued capital of the Listed Entity, and the (full) purposes for which the funds raised will be used);\n\ne)\tif any changes to the Listed Entity’s Board, or senior management, are proposed as a result of the transaction, details of those changes; and\n\nf)\tthe timetable for implementing the transaction.\n\n125) DISCLOSURES – SYSTEMS, CONTROLS & CONTENT\nThe contents of a Disclosure\nIt is open to\n\n1\nwhose Securities are listed by the Regulator, another Financial Services Regulator or a Regulated Exchange, which is subject to disclosure obligations broadly equivalent to those set out in the Market Rules;\n(vii)\ta law firm, notary firm or other legal business that carries on its business in the ADGM;\n(viii)\tan accounting firm, insolvency firm, auditor or other audit firm that carries on its business in the ADGM;\n(b)\tproduct, service, transaction or delivery channel risk factors, including whether the product or service is:\n(i)\ta Contract of Insurance which is non-life insurance;\n(ii)\ta Contract of Insurance which is a life insurance product with no investment return or redemption or surrender value;\n(iii)\tan insurance policy for a pension scheme that does not provide for an early surrender option, and cannot be used as collateral;\n(iv)\ta pension, superannuation or similar scheme that satisfies the following conditions:\n(A)\tthe scheme provides retirement benefits to employees;\n(B)\tcontributions to the scheme are made by way of deductions from wages; and\n(C)\tthe scheme rules do not permit the assignment of a member’s interest under the scheme;\n(v)\ta product where the risks of money laundering are adequately managed by other factors such as transaction limits or transparency of ownership; and\n(c)\tgeographical and jurisdictional risk factors, including whether a country or countries:\n(i)\tare identified by credible sources as having effective systems to counter money laundering;\n(ii)\tare identified by credible sources as having a low level of corruption or other criminal activity, such as terrorism, money laundering, or the production and supply of illicit drugs;\n(iii)\thave been assessed by credible sources, as having:\n(A)\trequirements to counter money laundering that are consistent with the FATF Recommendations; and\n(B)\teffectively implement FATF Recommendations.\n7.1.3.(2) For the purposes of ‎7.1.3(1)(c), a credible source includes, but is not limited to, mutual evaluations, detailed assessment reports or follow-up reports issued by FATF, the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD and other International Organisations.\n7.1.3.Guidance on the customer risk\u003C/s\u003E\u003Cs\u003E[INST] You are a regulatory compliance and legal expert reviewing regulatory documents.

See also the best practice standards in APP 4 which apply to Directors of Listed Entities who are subject to the Corporate Governance Principles.\n\n9.3.3 Equality of treatment. Subject to Rules 9.3.14 to 9.3.17, the Board of a Listed Entity must ensure equality of treatment of all holders of Securities of a particular class or type in respect of all rights attaching to the Securities of that class or type of Securities.\n9.3.3.Guidance \nFor the Rules relating to Weighted Voting Rights, refer to Rules 9.3.14 to 9.3.20. These set out the circumstances where a Listed Entity can potentially deviate from the “one-share, one-vote” principle established by this Rule.\n\n9.3.4 Reduction of Share capital. The Board of a Listed Entity must ensure that a Listed Entity does not purchase its own Shares unless:\n(1)\tthe purchase does not materially prejudice the Listed Entity's ability to pay its creditors as they fall due;\n(2)\tit has obtained prior approval of Shareholders in meeting by a majority vote; and\n(3)\tprior to the meeting seeking the consent referred to in (2), the notice of the meeting and any accompanying documents relating to the purchase is filed with the Regulator.\n9.3.5 [Deleted]\n\n9.3.6 Communications with Shareholders\n9.3.6.(1) The Board of a Listed Entity must ensure that all the necessary information and facilities are available to\n\n11\nfor commercial recovery, and to progress the relevant project;\n(4)\tif the disclosed estimates of Contingent Resources are contingent on technology under development, to ensure that Unrecoverable quantities are not classified as part of the Contingent Resources, an explanation of whether the technology has:\n(a)\tbeen demonstrated to be commercially viable in analogous reservoirs;\n(b)\tbeen demonstrated to be commercially viable in other reservoirs that are not analogous, and that a pilot project, which is planned and budgeted, will be necessary to demonstrate commerciality for this reservoir; or\n(c)\tnot been demonstrated to be commercially viable, but is currently under active development, and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the technology may reasonably be expected to be available for commercial application within five years; and\n(5)\tif the disclosed estimates of Contingent Resources relate to Unconventional Petroleum Resources, the:\n(a)\ttype(s) of Unconventional Contingent Resource;\n(b)\tland area;\n(c)\tnumber of wells; and\n(d)\tspecialised extraction technology proposed to be utilised.\n12.10.1.Guidance \nThe Petroleum Reporting Standard defines ‘unconventional resources’ in section 2.4 and its Appendix A. Sections 1.1 and 8.6 of the PRMS Guidelines provide additional guidance on Unconventional Petroleum Resources.\n12.11 Petroleum Reserves\n12.11.1 A Petroleum Reporting Entity disclosing estimates of Petroleum Reserves must comply with the following:\n(1)\tthe term ‘reserves’ must only be used for estimates of commercially recoverable quantities of Petroleum;\n(2)\tPetroleum Reserves must be categorised and disclosed as either 1P, 2P or 3P in the most specific category that best reflects the degree of uncertainty in the estimated quantities of recoverable Petroleum, and if an estimate of 3P is disclosed, also disclose estimates of 2P and 1P;\n(3)\tthe Reference Point used for the purpose of measuring and assessing the estimated Petroleum Reserves must be identified;\nGuidance\nSections 7.1 and 9.13 of the PRMS Guidelines provide specific guidance on Reference Points.\n(4)\tIf Petroleum Reserves are not disclosed net of CiO up to the Reference Point, the disclosure is to identify the portion of\n\n11\nBoard.\n9.3.1.Guidance\n9.3.1.Guidance.1. Where a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 is required under any legislation applicable to such a Person to comply with a similar or more stringent requirement than the requirements in this section, compliance with those other requirements would be sufficient for the purposes of the relevant requirement in this section.\n9.3.1.Guidance.2. For example, in the case of a reduction of Share capital, more stringent procedures such as a special resolution (i.e. a vote of at least 75% of the Shareholders in voting) may be required under the company law or other legislation applicable to a Listed Entity in its jurisdiction of incorporation. Where this is the case, compliance with the more stringent requirements applicable to the Listed Entity suffices for the purposes of compliance with the requirements in this section dealing with a Shareholder approval by simple majority in Rule 9.3.8.\n9.3.1.Guidance.3. The Regulator will expect a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 to consider references to a “Shareholder” in this section to refer equally to holders of all classes of Securities as may be applicable in the context of the Listed Entity. For example, in a situation where holders of Debentures are to be asked to vote on a variation of rights or terms, the Regulator will expect a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 to give due consideration to the requirements of Rules 9.3.6 and 9.3.7 as if it referred to the relevant Debenture holders.\n\n9.3.2 Directors' duties. A Director of a Listed Entity must act:\n(1)\ton a fully informed basis;\n(2)\tin good faith;\n(3)\thonestly;\n(4)\twith due diligence and care; and\n(5)\tin the best interests of the Listed Entity and its Shareholders.\n9.3.2.Guidance \nIn order to meet the obligation to act with due diligence and care, a Director should (amongst other things) ensure that he has enough time and capacity available to devote to the\n\n11\nrequired to be made under these Rules which include a statement about Petroleum Resources, including estimates of Petroleum Reserves, Contingent Resources or Prospective Resources, including within a Prospectus, Exempt Offer document, bidder’s and target’s statements, annual reports, financial statements, technical papers, presentations, and website content and disclosures.\nTo ensure consistency of its disclosures, Issuers and Petroleum Reporting Entities should be mindful of the table format for disclosure of Petroleum Resources set out in Form-12-1.\n12.2.2 Requirements for all disclosures. Where a disclosure by a Petroleum Reporting Entity does not meet a non-mandatory requirement contained in the Petroleum Reporting Standard, the Petroleum Reporting Entity must provide in its disclosure a statement as to how and why its disclosure differs from the non-mandatory requirement contained in the relevant Petroleum Reporting Standard.\n12.2.2.Guidance \nRule 12.2.1(1) requires a Petroleum Reporting Entity to fully comply with all binding requirements set out in the Petroleum Reporting Standard (including any tables, appendices or schedules).  The Regulator also expects a Petroleum Reporting Entity to fully comply with all non-mandatory requirements set out in the Petroleum Reporting Standard, or explain their non-compliance in accordance with Rule 12.2.2.\n12.2.3 Requirements for all disclosures. A Petroleum Reporting Entity must disclose Petroleum Resources in the most specific resource class that the Petroleum Resources can be classified under the Petroleum Reporting Standard.\n12.2.3.Guidance \nThe specific classes for Petroleum Resources are identified in section 1.1 of the Petroleum Reporting Standard. They are production, Petroleum Reserves, Contingent Resources, Prospective Resources and unrecoverable Petroleum. The PRMS Guidelines provide additional guidance on Petroleum Resource classification.\n12.2.4 Requirements for all disclosures. A disclosure that includes estimates of Petroleum Reserves, Contingent Resources or Prospective Resources must:\n(1)\tclearly identify whether the Deterministic Method or Probabilistic Method was used in preparing the estimates; and\nGuidance\nAdditional guidance on Deterministic Methods (in sections 4.1 and 5.2) and Probabilistic Methods (in\n\n11\nIt does not apply to any other issue of Securities under an Underwriting agreement, for example, the payment of fees related to the Underwriting.\n9.7.4.(3)\n9.7.4.(3).(a) An issue of Securities to make up the shortfall on a Pro Rata Issue to holders of:\n(i)\tOrdinary Securities; or\n(ii)\tOrdinary Securities and to holders of other Equity Securities to the extent that the terms of issue of the Equity Securities permit participation in the Pro Rata Issue.\n9.7.4.(3).(b) The Listed Entity  must have stated as part of the Offer that it reserves the right to issue the shortfall and what their allocation policy will be in relation to the shortfall.\n9.7.4.(3).(c) The Listed Entity must make the issue to make up the shortfall not later than three months after the close of the Offer, and the issue price must not be less than the price at which the Securities were offered under the Pro Rata Issue.\n9.7.4.(4) An issue of Securities under:\n(a)\ta dividend or distribution plan; or\n(b)\tan agreement to Underwrite the shortfall on a dividend or distribution plan where:\n(i)\tdetails of the Underwriting agreement were Disclosed prior to the date for payment of the dividend or distribution in accordance with Rule 3.8.1 or 7.6.1; and\n(ii)\tthe Listed Entity makes the issue within 15 Business Days after the date for payment of the dividend or distribution.\n9.7.4.(4).Guidance\n9.7.4.(4).1.

Under this arrangement, the Authorised Person can commingle the PSIA holder's funds with its own funds or with other funds which the Authorised Person has the right to invest on an unrestricted basis (i.e. funds from other Unrestricted PSIAs). The PSIA holders and the Authorised Person generally participate in the returns on the invested funds.\n5.4.4.Guidance.(iii) In a Restricted PSIA, the PSIA holder imposes certain restrictions as to where, how and for what purpose the funds are to be invested. Further, the Authorised Person may be restricted from commingling its own funds with the restricted PSIA funds for the purposes of investment. In addition, there may be other restrictions that the PSIA holders may impose. In other words, the funds provided by holders of Restricted PSIAs are managed by the Authorised Person which does not have the right to use or dispose of the investments in which those funds are made except within the conditions of the relevant PSIA Investment Contract.\n5.4.4.Guidance.(iv) An Authorised Person undertaking Islamic Financial Business is also exposed to fiduciary risk which arises where the terms of the relevant PSIA Investment Contract between the Authorised Person and the\n\n9\nhow it proposes to organise and control the activities that arise from Managing a PSIA and ensure that the activities undertaken by it in Managing a PSIA are conducted in accordance with Shari'a.\n5.4.3.(b) The policy must as a minimum address, where appropriate, the following matters:\n(i)\thow the interests of that Authorised Person’s shareholders and its PSIA holders are safeguarded;\n(ii)\thow the Authorised Person will limit the exposure of PSIA holders to the Authorised Person;\n(iii)\ta description of the controls to ensure that the funds of the PSIA are invested in accordance with the investment guidelines agreed in the PSIA Investment Contract;\n(iv)\tthe basis for allocating profits and losses to the PSIA holders;\n(v)\tthe policy for making provisions and reserves and, in respect of PSIAs, to whom these provisions and reserves revert in the event of a write-off or recovery;\n(vi)\tthe Authorised Person's policy on the prioritisation of investment of own funds and those of Unrestricted PSIA holders;\n(vii)\thow liquidity mismatch will be monitored;\n(viii)\tthe basis for allocating expenses to PSIA holders; and\n(ix)\thow the Authorised Person will monitor the value of its own assets and the assets of PSIA holders.\n\n5.4.4 Displaced commercial risk.

This risk reflects the fact that an Authorised Person may find itself under commercial pressure to pay a rate of return to its PSIA holders which is sufficient to induce those investors to maintain the investment of their funds in an Unrestricted PSIA managed by the Authorised Person, rather than withdrawing those funds from the Unrestricted PSIA and investing them elsewhere.

These product specific Rules apply in addition to any other Rules applicable to the Regulated Activity being conducted by Authorised Person (e.g., Operating a Multilateral Trading Facility, Providing Custody or Dealing). Though the requirements set out in COBS Rule 17.1.2 already apply to Authorised Persons generally, COBS Rule 17.1.2 operates as a ‘sign-post’ Rule designed to draw the attention of Authorised Persons conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets to the fact that they must comply with all Rules applicable to Authorised Persons, including:\n\na)\tall other relevant chapters of COBS;\n\nb)\tthe FSRA General Rulebook (“GEN”);\n\nc)\tthe FSRA Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Rules and Guidance (“AML”); and\n\nd)\tthe FSRA Code of Market Conduct (“CMC”).\n\n18) The table below sets out the main risk areas, and the related mitigations for each of these risks areas, under the Virtual Asset Framework.\n/Table Start\nRISK\tMITIGANT\n1.\tAML/CFT/TAX\tThe AML Rulebook applies in full to all Authorised Persons.\n\nAuthorised Persons also need to consider their reporting obligations in relation to FATCA and the Common Reporting Standards.\n\n2.\tCONSUMER PROTECTION\tAll material risks associated with Virtual Assets generally, Accepted Virtual Assets and an Authorised Persons’ products, services and activities must be appropriately disclosed, and monitored and updated on an ongoing basis.\n\n3.\tTECHNOLOGY GOVERNANCE\tSystems and controls must be in place in relation to:\n•\tVirtual Asset wallets;\n•\tPrivate keys;\n•\tOrigin and destination of Virtual Asset funds;\n•\tSecurity; and\n•\tRisk management and systems recovery.\n4.\t‘EXCHANGE-TYPE’ ACTIVITIES\tMultilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) using Virtual Assets are required to have in place, among other things, the following:\n•\tMarket surveillance;\n•\tFair and orderly trading;\n•\tSettlement processes;\n•\tTransaction recording;\n•\tA rulebook(s);\n•\tTransparency & public disclosure mechanisms; and\n•\tExchange-like operational systems and controls.\n5.\tCUSTODY\tAuthorised Persons that are Providing Custody that hold or control either Accepted Virtual Assets and / or Client Money (e.g.,\n\n35\n“Operating a Multilateral Trading Facility”.\n4.3 The Threshold Conditions set out in GEN Rule 5.2.7, require a PFP Applicant to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FSRA that it:\n(a)\thas adequate and appropriate resources, including financial resources;\n(b)\tis fit and proper;\n(c)\tis capable of being effectively supervised; and\n(d)\thas adequate compliance arrangements, including policies and procedures, that will enable it to comply with all the applicable legal requirements.\n4.4 Chapter 2 of the GPM sets out in detail the FSRA’s approach to assessing whether an applicant for an FSP meets the Threshold Conditions above. Some key considerations for PFP Applicants are the following:\n(a)\tBusiness Model\nThe FSRA will consider the PFP Applicant’s proposed business model and assess any potential risks it poses. In particular, the FSRA will consider:\n(i)\tthe nature and structure of the products offered on the PFP;\n(ii)\tthe PFP Applicant’s target Clients;\n(iii)\tthe roles and responsibilities of the PFP Applicant;\n(iv)\twhether the Applicant will carry out primary and/or secondary trading;\n(v)\twhether the PFP Applicant might have any perceived conflicts of interest when authorised and how these might be managed;\n(vi)\tany proposed outsourcing arrangements with third party service providers;\n(vii)\twhether the PFP Applicant is proposing to carry out any other Regulated Activities; and\n(viii)\tthe safekeeping arrangements for Client Assets if the PFP Applicant intends to hold these.\nIn the case that a PFP Applicant proposes to carry out other Regulated Activities such as Operating a MTF, Advising on Investments or Credit, Managing Assets or Managing a Collective Investment Fund, the PFP Applicant would need to demonstrate how it would manage any potential conflicts of interest that these activities may pose.\n(b)\tTrack Record\nA PFP Applicant should demonstrate that it or its Group has an established track record in corporate finance or a related business, of a minimum of five years, in a jurisdiction that has a legislative and regulatory framework that is of comparable standard to that of\n\n19\nwith mitigation of the ML/TF risks associated with the use of Virtual Assets.  Technological features, such as secure digital signatures that allow the verification of a Client’s identity through a signed document, may also be acceptable to the FSRA. In all cases, an Authorised Person should ensure that the use of these technologies will not lead to a simplified process where the required Customer Risk Assessment and CDD requirements are not appropriately undertaken by an Authorised Person.\n\nm)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA recommends that Authorised Persons obtain a signed self-certification from their Clients identifying the details of all passports issued and held in their name(s). Authorised Persons may also use this as an opportunity to capture all tax related details in order to meet their international tax reporting obligations. Self-certification should not prevent Authorised Persons from conducting proper CDD.\n\n\nn)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nAuthorised Persons are required to implement an appropriate governance structure, especially in relation to Information Technology governance , and provide for the development and maintenance of all necessary systems and controls to ensure appropriate ML and TF compliance.\n\no)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects that Authorised Persons may seek to utilise (their own or third-party) technologies and solutions to meet their regulatory obligations (e.g., customer risk assessment, detection of fraud, and transaction identification, monitoring and reporting) and risk management requirements (e.g., margin limits, large exposure monitoring).\n\np)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations\n\n19\nof its compliance responsibilities.

Disparities are found to varying degrees in practices related to the oversight, governance, operations and controls of storage facilities, and in the transparency afforded by those who practice it.  While the FSRA does not expect that delivery and storage practices will become uniform across Accepted Spot Commodity activities, the FSRA does expect adherence to good or sound storage practices as established in COBS Rules 22.4.1 to 22.4.6.\n\n33) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nPursuant to COBS Rule 22.4.1, a delivery and/or storage facility used by an Authorised Person can be operated from within ADGM or outside ADGM.  Specifically, for the purposes of COBS Rules 22.4.1, an Authorised Person will need to submit to the FSRA the details of how each delivery and storage facility that it proposes to use, whether located inside or outside ADGM, meets the requirements set out in Rule 22.4.2(a) to (e).\n\n34) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nFor the purposes of COBS Rule 22.4.2(a), where the proposed storage facility is located outside ADGM, an Authorised Person should provide an assessment on how the rules and regulations of that jurisdiction are deemed (legally and operationally) equivalent to those of ADGM.

Where necessary, further third-party audits will be required for the obligations of Accepted Spot Commodities, as outlined in paragraph 26 above.\n\n36) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nCOBS Rules 22.4.2(c)(i) and (ii) require a delivery and/or storage facility to adhere, or adopt, appropriate international standards for storage and delivery mechanisms (including with regard to IOSCO’s Good and Sound Practices), as well as with OHSAS 18001 Health & Safety Management (or equivalent certification standards).  For the latter, such adherence should also include standards relating to quarantine and bio hazards.\n\n37) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nWhen applying COBS Rule 22.4.2(e), an Authorised Person should undertake a full assessment of the risks associated with each proposed storage facility, and will be expected to provide details of appropriate insurance to protect market participants from financial loss resulting from these risks.\n\n38) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nPursuant to COBS Rule 22.4.3, an Authorised Person must have arrangements in place for the approval, management, monitoring and control of a storage facility operated by itself or by third parties.  In demonstrating compliance with the Rule, an Authorised Person must have powers to resolve any negative circumstances/behaviour in a timely\n\n34\nproposed arrangements, which should be such that they are fair, transparent and non-discriminatory for all market participants.\n\n42) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nPursuant to COBS Rule 22.4.5, an Authorised Person must have arrangements in place with a delivery and/or storage facility to notify the Authorised Person of any changes which may affect the capability of the delivery and/or storage facility to facilitate properly its role in the settlement and delivery of the Accepted Spot Commodity(s).  An Authorised Person should require the delivery and/or storage facility to make timely disclosure the Authorised Person of any changes in terms of service, particularly if that could have an impact on the market price of an Accepted Spot Commodity.  In addition, an Authorised Person should keep the FSRA fully informed as to any issues related to delivery and/or storage related to disputes, defaults, delays, or penalties surrounding the delivery process.\n\n43) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nThe requirements outlined in paragraphs 33 to 42 should be formalised in the rules, policies and procedures of an Authorised Person, as well as in the application for participation in the delivery process, or included with the contract or any other agreement that the delivery and/or storage facility enters into to formally codify the powers over its delivery and/or storage activities and behaviours.\n\n44) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nFrom a governance perspective, the delivery and storage of Accepted Spot Commodities is to be appropriately governed and structured in order to avoid or mitigate actual or potential conflicts of interest between delivery and/or storage functions, and any other activities or functions within an Authorised Person, its Group or with relevant third parties.  Such governance arrangements may include having a separate team, which does not have other conflicting responsibilities within the Authorised\n\n34\nCommodities Framework therefore, the FSRA has defined Spot Commodity Title in GLO, as follows:\n\n“Spot Commodity Title” means an instrument that confers on the holder a right entitling the holder to hold, acquire, or transfer, an Accepted Spot Commodity.\n\n30) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodity Title\nFor clarification, and as relevant to COBS Rule 22.5, the FSRA considers a Spot Commodity Title is -\n\na)\tan original legal document proving ownership over a defined and verifiable quantity or portion of a Spot Commodity;\n\nb)\tan original legal document that can be used to transfer ownership of a Spot Commodity;\n\nc)\tnot a contract for the sale of a commodity under which delivery is to be made at a future date, other than the period generally accepted in the market for that Spot Commodity as the standard delivery period (it is not therefore considered a ‘Future’);\n\nd)\tnot a Financial Instrument involving conventional assets (e.g., Securities or Derivatives); and\n\ne)\tnot a digital, virtual or tokenised right over a Spot Commodity.\n\n31) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodity Title\nThe FSRA only permits activities involving a Spot Commodity Title where the underlying Spot Commodity which has been deemed by the FSRA to be an Accepted Spot Commodity.  For the purposes of this guidance, activities applicable to Accepted Spot Commodities should be understood to include Spot Commodity Titles.\n\n32) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nThe FSRA recognises that there is a wide range of practices related to the storage of Spot Commodities, which vary by type of Spot Commodity, trading venue, and jurisdiction.  Disparities are found to varying degrees in practices related to the oversight, governance, operations and controls of storage facilities, and in the transparency afforded by those who practice it.  While the FSRA does not expect that delivery and storage practices will become uniform across Accepted Spot Commodity\n\n34\nRCH being read as references to an SCSF).\n\n92) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodity Settlement Facilities (SCSFs)\nPursuant to MIR Rule 4.3.3, in determining whether there are satisfactory arrangements for securing the timely discharge of the rights and liabilities of the parties to transactions, the FSRA may have regard to the SCSF’s:\n\na)\trules and practices relating to clearing and settlement, including its arrangements with another Person for the provision of clearing and settlement services;\n\nb)\tarrangements for matching trades and ensuring that the parties are in agreement about trade details;\n\nc)\tarrangements for making deliveries and payments, in all relevant jurisdictions;\n\nd)\tprocedures to detect and deal with the failure of a Member (or participants) to settle in accordance with its rules;\n\ne)\tarrangements for taking action to settle a trade if a Member (or participant) does not settle in accordance with its rules;\n\nf)\tarrangements for monitoring its Members’ settlement performance; and\n\ng)\tDefault Rules and default procedures.\n\n93) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodity Settlement Facilities (SCSFs)\nThe FSRA reserves the right at any point in time, either during the Authorisation process  or as part of its supervisory oversight of an SCSF, to consider the applicability of other Rules within MIR Chapter 4 (Rules Applicable to RCHs), dependent on the relevance of those Rules to the business model/operations of the SCSF.\n\n94) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodity Settlement Facilities (SCSFs)\nEntities seeking to operate as SCSF’s should take note of the following:\n\na)\tFor transactions where delayed settlement occurs (e.g., on an end of day or t+n basis), the FSRA may likely require the SCSF to integrate specific risk management functions within its operations, as per the requirements of MIR Chapter 4, including in relation to (but not limited) to the scenarios identified in (b) and (c) below.\n\nb)\tFor transactions with instantaneous delivery versus payment (DvP) , the FSRA may deem certain aspects relating\n\n34\nthe powers over its delivery and/or storage activities and behaviours.\n\n44) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nFrom a governance perspective, the delivery and storage of Accepted Spot Commodities is to be appropriately governed and structured in order to avoid or mitigate actual or potential conflicts of interest between delivery and/or storage functions, and any other activities or functions within an Authorised Person, its Group or with relevant third parties.  Such governance arrangements may include having a separate team, which does not have other conflicting responsibilities within the Authorised Person (or relevant third party), handling the delivery and storage (or oversight of third parties doing so).  This is to include due diligence over applicable requirements for Accepted Spot Commodities, as established in paragraph 25.\n\n45) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nWhere an Authorised Person wishes to outsource part or all delivery and settlement arrangements (including due diligence) to a third party, the Authorised Person is required to perform its due diligence and background checks on the third party, and ensure that the third party meets all the FSRA’s requirements applicable to delivery and settlement arrangements.  Such Authorised Persons are required to make full disclosures to their Members and to the FSRA regarding such outsourced arrangements.  The Authorised Person retains full responsibility from a regulatory perspective for any issues that may result from such outsourcing, including the failure of any third party to meet its delivery and settlement arrangements (including due diligence).\n\n46) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nNoting the requirements set out in COBS Rules 22.4.2 to 22.4.6, an Authorised Person should have in place arrangements to ensure the financial stability, and continued operation, of the delivery and/or storage facility.  The FSRA may require upon demand, or on a periodic basis, a statement\n\n34\nor OTFs (as applicable).  Therefore, for the purposes of settlement of Spot Commodities, the arrangements that an MTF or OTF would normally have in place with a RCH can be met with suitable arrangements in place with an SCSF, if the requirements as described in this section are met.\n\n90) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodity Settlement Facilities (SCSFs)\nPursuant to MIR Rule 3.8.1, MTFs/OTFs are required to have satisfactory arrangements for securing the timely discharge of the rights and liabilities of the parties to transactions taking place on its platform.  MIR Rule 3.8.2 allows for a RCH or Remote Clearing House to be deemed as sufficient for the purposes of satisfying MIR Rule 3.8.1.\n\n91) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodity Settlement Facilities (SCSFs)\nPursuant to MIR Rule 3.8.3, however, and in the context of Accepted Spot Commodities, an MTF/OTF must provide the FSRA the satisfactory arrangements made when such MTF or OTF does not engage a RCH (for example, to use in this context, when it has engaged, or proposing to engage, an SCSF).  To clarify, the FSRA will require that arrangements to use an SCSF for settlement purposes will require the SCSF to comply with the requirements of MIR Rule 4.3.3 (with the references to a RCH being read as references to an SCSF).\n\n92) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodity Settlement Facilities (SCSFs)\nPursuant to MIR Rule 4.3.3, in determining whether there are satisfactory arrangements for securing the timely discharge of the rights and liabilities of the parties to transactions, the FSRA may have regard to the SCSF’s:\n\na)\trules and practices relating to clearing and settlement, including its arrangements with another Person for the provision of clearing and settlement services;\n\nb)\tarrangements for matching trades and ensuring that the parties are in agreement about trade details;\n\nc)\tarrangements for making deliveries\n\n34\narrangements, with the holding of Accepted Spot Commodities introducing additional operational risks.  For example, the safekeeping of gold bullion would require a custodian with appropriate secure vault facilities.\n\n50) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nCustody\nFor clarity, Custody arrangements differ to the services provided by delivery and/or storage facilities, as an Authorised Person that is Providing Custody is responsible for (as set out in COBS, Chapters 14, 15 and 16) arranging proper protection for Clients' Assets (including Accepted Spot Commodities) and Relevant Money.  By contrast, delivery and/or storage facilities are used by Authorised Persons (including those Providing Custody) in discharging their responsibilities, but the delivery and/or storage facility itself has no responsibility for safeguarding Accepted Spot Commodities, other than those included in the commercial agreement with the Authorised Person.\n\n51) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nCustody\nIn assessing whether an Authorised Person that is Providing Custody is able to fully comply with the arrangements of COBS Rule 22.8, the Authorised Person is required to demonstrate that suitable custodial arrangements are in place to securely hold each Accepted Spot Commodity.  The Authorised Person should consider appointing third-party experts to test and verify the proposed physical custodial arrangements, including relevant security and controls, to provide the FSRA the necessary comfort in relation to these arrangements.\n\n52) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nCustody\nPursuant to COBS Rule 22.8.3, an Authorised Person is required to carry out reconciliations of Accepted Spot Commodity stocks on a more frequent basis (than as usually provided for in COBS Chapter 14, in relation to more conventional instruments/assets).  Authorised Persons will need to submit to the FSRA the details of how proposed arrangements, including outsourced arrangements where applicable, are suitable.\n\n53) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nCustody\nThe FSRA expects that pursuant to COBS Rule 22.8.3, reconciliations are to include, where applicable, verification\n\n34\nthe details of how each Accepted Spot Commodity that is proposed to be used meets the requirements for the purposes of COBS Rule 22.2.2 and paragraphs 25 and 26 above.  The use of each Accepted Spot Commodity will be approved as part of the formal application process for review and approval of an FSP.  Though an Authorised Person may, for example, propose to admit to trading a commonly traded Spot Commodity, the Authorised Person’s controls relating to responsible and sustainable sourcing, and sound delivery mechanisms may not yet be fully developed.  In such circumstances, the FSRA may require the Authorised Person to delay the commencement of trading until such time that suitable controls have been developed and implemented.\n\n28) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodities and Accepted Spot Commodities\nDue to Accepted Spot Commodities being determined for use on the basis of each individual Authorised Person, the FSRA will not maintain a ‘public’ list of Accepted Spot Commodities.\n\n29) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodity Title\nThe FSRA’s regulatory approach under the Spot Commodities Framework allows for Accepted Spot Commodities to be settled through physical delivery or through the exchange of ownership title, which includes warrants, bills of lading or warehouse receipts.  For the purposes of the Spot Commodities Framework therefore, the FSRA has defined Spot Commodity Title in GLO, as follows:\n\n“Spot Commodity Title” means an instrument that confers on the holder a right entitling the holder to hold, acquire, or transfer, an Accepted Spot Commodity.\n\n30) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodity Title\nFor clarification, and as relevant to COBS Rule 22.5, the FSRA considers a Spot Commodity Title is -\n\na)\tan original legal document proving ownership over a defined and verifiable quantity or portion of a Spot Commodity;\n\nb)\tan original legal document that can be used to transfer ownership\n\n34\nmade available to all relevant market participants on similar terms is to be undertaken.  The FSRA expects that an Authorised Person consider publishing a list of available fees and discounts which are charged by, and available from, its appointed delivery and/or storage facilities.\n\n40) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nThe FSRA recognises that there is a wide range of practices relating to commercial terms by which a Spot Commodity is delivered, as well as post-delivery assessment mechanisms for quality control and settlement adjustments.  Accordingly, Authorised Persons will need to submit to the FSRA the details of how each delivery and storage facility that it proposes to use meets the requirements set out in Rule 20.4.4 (a) to (g), including how they are suitable for the Accepted Spot Commodity, as well as how they are aligned with the generally accepted practices in the market for that Accepted Spot Commodity.\n\n41) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nWhen applying COBS Rules 22.4.5 and 22.4.6, an Authorised Person should have arrangements in place to allow Members to fulfil their delivery obligations, or other appropriate measures of resolution and restitution, to ensure the Authorised Person is able to operate on a fair and orderly basis.  The FSRA will review these proposed arrangements, which should be such that they are fair, transparent and non-discriminatory for all market participants.\n\n42) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nPursuant to COBS Rule 22.4.5, an Authorised Person must have arrangements in place with a delivery and/or storage facility to notify the Authorised Person of any changes which may affect the capability of the delivery and/or storage facility to facilitate properly its role in the settlement and delivery of the Accepted Spot Commodity(s).

This passing of time, does not, of itself, indicate that there has been a delay in the Disclosure.  Some Disclosures may be able to be prepared and Disclosed relatively quickly, while others may take longer.  The question in each case is whether the Reporting Entity is proceeding to complete and make its Disclosure as quickly as it can in the circumstances and not deferring, postponing or delaying it to a later time.\n\n45) IMMEDIATELY\nThe Listing Authority recognises that how quickly a Reporting Entity can make a Disclosure of Inside Information will vary, depending on a number of factors, including:\n\na)\tthe need for the Disclosure to be carefully prepared so that it is not false, misleading or deceptive, and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of the Inside Information (as required by Rule 7.2.1(2));\n\nb)\twhere and when the Inside Information originated;\n\nc)\tthe forewarning, if any, the Listed Entity/Reporting Entity had of the information;\n\nd)\tthe amount, and complexity, of the Inside Information;\n\ne)\tthe need, in some circumstances, to verify the accuracy of the Inside Information;\n\nf)\tthe need, in some circumstances, for a Disclosure to comply with specific legal or Rule requirements; and\n\ng)\tthe need, in some circumstances, for a Disclosure to be approved by a Reporting Entity’s Board or disclosure committee.\n\n46) IMMEDIATELY\nThe Listing Authority will take into account the above factors when assessing whether a Reporting Entity has complied with its obligations to make a Disclosure under Rule 7.2.1 promptly and without delay.\n\n47) IMMEDIATELY\nIf the obligation to Disclose Inside Information under Rule 7.2.1 is triggered during a period when the Recognised Investment Exchange (RIE) upon which the Listed Entity’s\n\n28\nregulatory and financial consequences that could result from the Reporting Entity having breached its obligation to Disclose Inside Information in accordance with Rule 7.2.1.\n\n51) IMMEDIATELY\nUse of a Trading Halt or Suspension to manage Disclosure issues\nA Trading Halt or Suspension is not equally suitable in every circumstance.  For example, a Trading Halt can only last for a maximum of two Business Days, so it will not be suitable in circumstances relating to a complex or protracted disclosure matter that is unlikely to be resolved within inside this time.  In these circumstances, a Suspension may be more appropriate.\n\n52) IMMEDIATELY\nUse of a Trading Halt or Suspension to manage Disclosure issues\nAs a Reporting Entity’s primary obligation under Rule 7.2.1 is to Disclose Inside Information promptly and without delay, the Listing Authority does not expect a Reporting Entity to request a Trading Halt, or Suspension, before it has determined whether the particular information represents Inside Information.  Having made this determination, if the Reporting Entity is able to make the required Disclosure promptly and without delay then, in normal circumstances, the Reporting Entity does not need a Trading Halt or Suspension to manage its disclosure obligations.\n\n53) IMMEDIATELY\nUse of a Trading Halt or Suspension to manage Disclosure issues\nA Trading Halt or Suspension may, however, be necessary in the following circumstances:\n\na)\tthere are indications that the Inside Information has lost its confidentiality ahead of a Disclosure (see Rule 7.2.2(2)), and it is having, or (where the RIE upon which the Listed Entity’s Securities are admitted to trading is not yet open for trading) is likely to have, when the RIE opens for trading, a significant effect on the price of the Listed Entity’s Securities;\n\nb)\tthe Reporting Entity has been asked by the Listing Authority to correct or prevent a false market;  or\n\nc)\tthe information is particularly significant\n\n28\nRelated Instruments) and would, if generally available, have a significant effect on the price of such Securities.  Importantly, section 95(6) additionally provides that it is information that a reasonable investor would use as part of the basis of their investment decision.\n\n25) INSIDE INFORMATION\nWhen is information Inside Information?\nIt should be noted that the test in section 95 of FSMR of whether information is Inside Information is objective, and the fact that a Reporting Entity’s officers may genuinely, and honestly, believe that information is not Inside Information, and that therefore it does not need to be Disclosed, will not avoid a breach of Rule 7.2.1, if that view is ultimately found to be incorrect.\n\n26) INSIDE INFORMATION\nWhen is information Inside Information?\nThe Listing Authority acknowledges that the various factors of the test for determining whether information is Inside Information may cause some difficulty for Reporting Entities to accurately make this assessment.  In complying with Rule 7.2.1 a Reporting Entity must predict how investors may react to particular information when it is Disclosed.  While in many circumstances this may be obvious, in others circumstances it may not be as clear.  This potential challenge is inescapable, however, as it is the Reporting Entity, and only the Reporting Entity, that can and must form a view as to whether the information of which it is aware (and the rest of the market is not aware of) is Inside Information, and therefore needs to be Disclosed under Rule 7.2.1.\n\n27) INSIDE INFORMATION\nWhen is information Inside Information?\nAn officer of a Reporting Entity who is facing a decision on whether information is Inside Information that needs to be Disclosed under Rule 7.2.1 may find it helpful to consider the following three questions:\n\na)\twould this information influence my decision to buy or sell Securities in the Listed Entity at\n\n28\nDisclosure under Rule 7.2.1 will generally not arise until the Board has made that decision.  It will not usually be necessary to request a Trading Halt pending a Board decision, although this may change if the subject/topic of what is to be decided by the Board no longer remains confidential.\n\n138) DISCLOSURES – SYSTEMS, CONTROLS & CONTENT\nBoard approval of Disclosures\nIn circumstances where the information to be Disclosed falls within the exceptions to immediate Disclosure under Rule 7.2.2, but the Board determines that it is appropriate and timely to make the Disclosure at that time, it will be the decision of the Board that is the trigger for the Disclosure, rather than any specific obligation under Rule 7.2.1.\n\n139) DISCLOSURES – SYSTEMS, CONTROLS & CONTENT\nBoard approval of Disclosures\nIn circumstances, however, where the Inside Information to be Disclosed relates to an event that has already happened, and the information:\n\na)\tdoes not, and did not at any time, fall within Rule 7.2.2; or\n\nb)\tfell within Rule 7.2.2, but has since ceased to do so,\n\nthe obligation to make a Disclosure will have arisen before the Board can consider the matter.   To comply with the timing requirements of Rule 7.2.1, the Disclosure must then be made promptly and without delay.  This, in turn, means that the required Board meeting to consider the Disclosure must be convened, and the Board must settle and approve the Disclosure, promptly and without delay.\n\n140) DISCLOSURES – SYSTEMS, CONTROLS & CONTENT\nBoard approval of Disclosures\nConsideration of this Disclosure cannot be delayed to a previously scheduled regular Board meeting, or to a meeting to be convened at a future date.  The Reporting Entity should also consider whether it may need to request a Trading Halt.  The Listing Authority strongly encourages a Reporting Entity that is unsure about whether it should be\n\n28\nview that it needs further information before it can assess if such information represents Inside Information, or by not making, or delaying, further enquiries or requesting relevant expert advice.  If a Listed Entity/Reporting Entity is in possession of information that constitutes Inside Information, the subjective view of its Officers that it requires further information before it can assess whether the information is Inside Information will not avoid a breach of Rule 7.2.1.  Furthermore, the extension of a Listed Entity’s awareness to information that an Officer ‘ought reasonably have come into possession of’ will require a Listed Entity/Reporting Entity, to make any further enquiries, or to obtain any expert advice, needed to confirm whether the information it has constitutes Inside Information to do so within a reasonable time period.\n\n\n43) IMMEDIATELY\nUnder Rule 7.2.1, Inside Information must be Disclosed ‘immediately’ upon the Reporting Entity becoming aware of the Inside Information, unless it falls within an exemption from Disclosure provided by Rule 7.2.2.  The Listing Authority considers that the word ‘immediately’ should not be read as meaning ‘instantaneously’, but rather as meaning ‘promptly and without delay’; that is, doing it as quickly as it can be done in the circumstances (acting promptly) and not deferring, postponing or putting it off to a later time.\n\n44) IMMEDIATELY\nIt is understood that some period of time will necessarily pass between when a Reporting Entity first becomes obliged to make a Disclosure under Rule 7.2.1, and when it makes that Disclosure.  This passing of time, does not, of itself, indicate that there has been a delay in the Disclosure.  Some Disclosures may be able to be prepared and Disclosed relatively quickly, while others may take longer.  The question in each case is whether the Reporting Entity is proceeding to complete and make its\n\n28\ntime to prepare a Disclosure, and the RIE’s market (in the Listed Entity’s Securities) is either currently trading or will commence trading before the Reporting Entity can make the Disclosure, the Listing Authority will usually suggest to the Reporting Entity that it requests a Trading Halt.\n\n115) FALSE MARKET (RULE 7.5.1(b))\nMedia reports, analyst reports and market rumours\nIn considering the circumstances of whether or not a report/rumour has caused, or is likely to cause, a false market, the Listing Authority is more likely to consider the impact, or likely impact, on the price of the Listed Entity’s Securities rather than the accuracy, or inaccuracy, of the information contained in the report/rumour.\n\n\n116) HOW DOES RULE 7.2.1 INTERACT WITH OTHER DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS?\nThe obligation of a Reporting Entity under Rule 7.2.1 to Disclose Inside Information is separate to, but operates closely with, a Reporting Entity’s other obligations under the Rules (particularly those in Chapter 9 and APP 2).  The Disclosure of information under, for example, APP 2 of the Rules will satisfy the obligation to Disclose Information under Rule 7.2.1 provided, in each case, the Disclosure is made within the timeframe required under Rule 7.2.1.\n\n117) HOW DOES RULE 7.2.1 INTERACT WITH OTHER DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS?\nThe continuous disclosure obligations in Rule 7.2.1 also, importantly, operate closely with the:\n\na)\tperiodic/financial disclosure obligations set out in chapter 10 of the Rules; and\n\nb)\tthe general disclosure obligations under FSMR, ADGM Commercial Laws (for Listed Entities incorporated in ADGM) and international commercial and corporate laws (for Listed Entities that are not incorporated in ADGM), including Prospectus Offer documents, bidders and targets statements, etc.\n\n118) HOW DOES RULE 7.2.1 INTERACT WITH OTHER DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS?\nOnce the documents referred to in paragraphs 117a) or 117b) above have been Disclosed, the Listing Authority will regard the information in them as now ‘within the market’, and therefore not\n\n28\nsome circumstances, for a Disclosure to comply with specific legal or Rule requirements; and\n\ng)\tthe need, in some circumstances, for a Disclosure to be approved by a Reporting Entity’s Board or disclosure committee.\n\n46) IMMEDIATELY\nThe Listing Authority will take into account the above factors when assessing whether a Reporting Entity has complied with its obligations to make a Disclosure under Rule 7.2.1 promptly and without delay.\n\n47) IMMEDIATELY\nIf the obligation to Disclose Inside Information under Rule 7.2.1 is triggered during a period when the Recognised Investment Exchange (RIE) upon which the Listed Entity’s Securities are admitted to trading  is not trading (e.g., overnight or on a weekend), the Listing Authority considers that it will normally be sufficient for the Reporting Entity to make its Disclosure before the RIE next opens for trading.  However, if the obligation to Disclose Inside Information under Rule 7.2.1 is triggered while the RIE is open for trading, the Reporting Entity will be expected to make a Disclosure as promptly as it can in the circumstances, and without delay.  If this is not possible, the Listing Authority would expect the Reporting Entity to request a Trading Halt.\n\n48) IMMEDIATELY\nIf a Listed Entity/Reporting Entity becomes aware of Inside Information relating to a future event (e.g., that a breach of financing covenant or the termination of a material agreement is inevitable), the Reporting Entity must Disclose this immediately after it becomes aware of that Inside Information.\n\n49) IMMEDIATELY\nUse of a Trading Halt or Suspension to manage Disclosure issues\nIf the RIE upon which a Listed Entity’s Securities is, or will be, trading immediately after a Reporting Entity first becomes obliged to Disclose Inside Information under Rule 7.2.1, but before the Reporting Entity can Disclose that Inside Information, the Reporting Entity should consider whether it is appropriate to request a Trading Halt\n\n28\nwith the:\n\na)\tperiodic/financial disclosure obligations set out in chapter 10 of the Rules; and\n\nb)\tthe general disclosure obligations under FSMR, ADGM Commercial Laws (for Listed Entities incorporated in ADGM) and international commercial and corporate laws (for Listed Entities that are not incorporated in ADGM), including Prospectus Offer documents, bidders and targets statements, etc.\n\n118) HOW DOES RULE 7.2.1 INTERACT WITH OTHER DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS?\nOnce the documents referred to in paragraphs 117a) or 117b) above have been Disclosed, the Listing Authority will regard the information in them as now ‘within the market’, and therefore not requiring separate Disclosure under Rule 7.2.1.\n\n119) HOW DOES RULE 7.2.1 INTERACT WITH OTHER DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS?\nThe Listing Authority does not generally expect a Reporting Entity to Disclose information in a document included in paragraph 117 above ahead of the scheduled release date for that document,  provided that all of the limbs in Rule 7.2.2 are met or that the Listing Authority does not consider that a Disclosure is required under Rule 7.5.1(b) to prevent a false market.  There will be cases, however, where in the course of preparing, for example, a financial disclosure required under chapter 10 of the Rules, Inside Information may come to light that ought to immediately Disclosed under Rule 7.2.1.\n\n120) HOW DOES RULE 7.2.1 INTERACT WITH OTHER DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS?\nAs a further example, in the course of preparing a financial disclosure as required under chapter 10 of the Rules, it may become clear to a Listed Entity/Reporting Entity that its reported earnings will differ significantly from those of the previous period.  In such a circumstance, the Reporting Entity must immediately Disclose this expected significant difference in earnings under Rule 7.2.1.  The Reporting Entity cannot wait until the scheduled release of the reported earnings (within the financial disclosure document) to Disclose the significant difference in\n\n28\nIn the case of the latter, a Reporting Entity cannot delay Disclosure of this information pending formal sign-off by the Board of the Listed Entity.  This will also be the case if there is Inside Information underlying a recommendation to the Board of the Listed Entity.\n\n41) BECOMING AWARE OF INSIDE INFORMATION\nA Listed Entity may receive information about a particular event or circumstance in instalments over time.  In some cases, the initial information about the event or circumstance is such that the Listed Entity cannot reasonably form a view on whether the information constitutes Inside Information and the Listed Entity/Reporting Entity may, therefore, need to wait for further, more complete, information, or make further enquiries, or obtain expert advice, in order to form a view.   In such a case, a Listed Entity will only become aware of Inside Information that needs to be Disclosed under Rule 7.2.1 when an Officer has, or ought reasonably to have, come €nto possession of sufficient information about the event or circumstance in order to be able to determine it represents Inside Information.\n\n42) BECOMING AWARE OF INSIDE INFORMATION\nReporting Entities should not be tempted to use this as an avenue to avoid, or delay, meeting its continuous disclosure obligations, by forming a ‘convenient’ view that it needs further information before it can assess if such information represents Inside Information, or by not making, or delaying, further enquiries or requesting relevant expert advice.  If a Listed Entity/Reporting Entity is in possession of information that constitutes Inside Information, the subjective view of its Officers that it requires further information before it can assess whether the information is Inside Information will not avoid a breach of Rule 7.2.1.  Furthermore, the extension of a Listed Entity’s awareness to information that an Officer ‘ought reasonably have\n\n28\nexample, previous Disclosures by the Reporting Entity, or media/analyst commentary.\n\n111) FALSE MARKET (RULE 7.5.1(b))\nMedia reports, analyst reports and market rumours\nThe Listing Authority does consider, however, that a Reporting Entity has a responsibility to respond to a report/rumour where it appears to contain, or is based on, credible Inside Information, whether it is accurate or not, and there is a significant impact on the price and/or traded volume of the Listed Entity’s Securities which coincides with the report/rumour.   If the Reporting Entity does not respond to the report/rumour voluntarily, the Listing Authority will consider using its powers under Rule 7.5.1 to require it to do so.\n\n112) FALSE MARKET (RULE 7.5.1(b))\nMedia reports, analyst reports and market rumours\nWhere the Listing Authority has concerns that a report/rumour has caused, or is likely to cause, a false market in a Listed Entity’s Securities, it will usually endeavour to contact the Reporting Entity to discuss the situation.   In such circumstances, the Listing Authority will usually ask the Reporting Entity to confirm whether the report/rumour is accurate.  When responding to this question, the Listing Authority expects the Reporting Entity to answer frankly and honestly, even if the report/rumour relates to information that the Reporting Entity considers confidential and not something that is required to be disclosed under Rule 7.2.2.\n\n113) FALSE MARKET (RULE 7.5.1(b))\nMedia reports, analyst reports and market rumours\nDepending on the circumstances relating to a report/rumour, if the Listing Authority is concerned that there is, or is likely to be, a false market in the Listed Entity’s Securities and the Reporting Entity advises that:\n\na)\tthe report/rumour is accurate, the Listing Authority may ask the Reporting Entity to make a Disclosure confirming the report/rumour, or it may ask the Reporting Entity to make a more detailed Disclosure under Rule 7.2.1;\n\nb)\tthe report/rumour is partially accurate,\u003C/s\u003E\u003Cs\u003E[INST] You are a regulatory compliance and legal expert reviewing regulatory documents.

This appendix sets out how an Insurer that is a Cell Company is required to calculate its Minimum Non Cellular Capital Requirement and the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement applicable to each Cell.\nAPP6.A6.1.2.Guidance.2. The Minimum Non Cellular Capital Requirement and the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement are calculated on a basis that is analogous to the basis of calculation of the Minimum Capital Requirement for Insurers that are not Cell Companies, as set out in ‎APP4.  This appendix therefore incorporates references to the provisions of ‎APP4.\nAPP6.A6.1.2.Guidance.3. The calculation of the Minimum Non Cellular Capital Requirement takes into account only Non Cellular Assets and Non Cellular liabilities, while the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement in respect of a Cell takes into account only Cellular Assets of that Cell and Cellular Liabilities of the same Cell.\nAPP6.A6.1.2.Guidance.4. The methods of calculation for the Minimum Non Cellular Capital Requirement and the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement in respect of a Cell are identical, so the\n\n12\non through Cells, every Insurer will have a Long Term Insurance risk component of zero in respect of its Minimum Non Cellular Capital Requirement.\nAPP6.A6.12.1 An Insurer must calculate the Long Term Insurance risk component in respect of a segment according to the method set out in Rule ‎A4.12, applied as though all references in that Rule to an Insurer were instead references to that segment.\nAPP6.A6.13 Asset management risk component\nAPP6.A6.13.Guidance \nThis section requires an Insurer to set aside capital in respect of assets that it manages.

This appendix sets out the manner in which an Insurer is required to calculate the Adjusted Fund Capital Resources in respect of each Long Term Insurance Fund it maintains.  The calculation is analogous to that applicable to Insurers other than Cell Companies, so that (except where changes are necessary to reflect structural differences) the capital of a Long Term Insurance Fund is determined as though it was an Insurer subject to ‎APP3.\nAPP7.A7.1.1.Guidance.2. The Adjusted Fund Capital Resources are calculated by making adjustments to the equity of the fund, as at the Solvency Reference Date.\nAPP7.A7.2 Adjusted Fund Capital Resources\nAPP7.A7.2.1 An Insurer must calculate the Adjusted Fund Capital Resources in respect of each Long Term Insurance Fund maintained by it, according to the formula:\nAFCR = AFE – FHCA\nwhere:\nAFCR means the Adjusted Fund Capital Resources in respect of the\n\n12\nCompanies, as set out in ‎APP4.  This appendix therefore incorporates references to the provisions of ‎APP4.\nAPP6.A6.1.2.Guidance.3. The calculation of the Minimum Non Cellular Capital Requirement takes into account only Non Cellular Assets and Non Cellular liabilities, while the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement in respect of a Cell takes into account only Cellular Assets of that Cell and Cellular Liabilities of the same Cell.\nAPP6.A6.1.2.Guidance.4. The methods of calculation for the Minimum Non Cellular Capital Requirement and the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement in respect of a Cell are identical, so the term Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement is used to refer to both.  Similarly, the term 'segment' is used in this appendix to refer to both a Cell and the non cellular part of an Insurer.\nAPP6.A6.2 Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement\nAPP6.A6.2.1 Every Insurer must calculate its Minimum Non Cellular Capital Requirement and the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement applicable to each Cell, in accordance with this appendix.\nAPP6.A6.2.2 Subject to Rules ‎A6.2.4, ‎A6.2.5, and ‎A6.2.6, an Insurer must calculate its Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement according to the formula:\nMSCR = DRC + IVRC + OARC + OLRC + CRC + SFAC + URC + RRC + LIRC + AMRC\nwhere:\n/Table Start\nTerm\tDefinition\nMSCR\tInsurer's Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement;\nDRC\tInsurer's default risk component in respect of that segment;\nIVRC\tInsurer's investment volatility risk component in respect of that segment;\nOARC\tInsurer's off balance sheet asset risk component in respect of that segment;\nOLRC\tInsurer's off balance sheet liability risk component in respect of that segment;\nCRC\tInsurer's concentration risk component in respect of that segment;\nSFAC\tInsurer's size factor adjustment component in respect of that segment;\nURC\tInsurer's underwriting risk component in respect of that segment;\nRRC\tInsurer's reserving risk component in respect of that segment;\nLIRC\tInsurer's Long Term Insurance risk component in respect of that segment;\nAMRC\tInsurer's asset management risk component in respect of that segment.\n/Table End\nAPP6.A6.2.2.Guidance \nBecause of the provision in Chapter ‎1 that all\n\n12\na Holding Company, where the Holding Company's investment is financed by debt rather than by its own capital.\nAPP3.A3.5.1 Hybrid capital includes the following items:\n(a)\tsubordinated debt;\n(b)\tpreference shares;\n(c)\tOwners' Equity in a Takaful Insurer, of the type described in Rule ‎A3.3.3; and\n(d)\tordinary shares issued by an Insurer to a Holding Company whose own paid up ordinary share capital, taken together with its general reserves, is lower than that of the Insurer.\nAPP3.A3.5.2 Subject to Rule ‎A3.5.3, an Insurer must calculate its hybrid capital adjustment as the amount by which the total amount of hybrid capital exceeds 15% of adjusted equity.\nAPP3.A3.5.3 The Regulator may at its discretion and on the application of an Insurer, permit that Insurer to apply Rule ‎A3.5.2 as though the figure of 15% was replaced with a higher figure approved in writing by the Regulator.  The approved figure may not be more than the actual percentage which the hybrid capital represents of adjusted equity, and may not in any case exceed 30%.\n\n\nAPP4 CALCULATION OF MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENT\nAPP4.A4.1 Purpose and general provisions\nAPP4.A4.1.1 This appendix applies to all Insurers to which Rule ‎4.3 applies.\nAPP4.A4.1.1.Guidance\nAPP4.A4.1.1.Guidance.1. This appendix sets out the manner in which an Insurer that is not a Cell Company is required to calculate its Minimum Capital Requirement.  The equivalent provisions for Insurers that are Cell Companies are set out in ‎APP6.\nAPP4.A4.1.1.Guidance.2. The Minimum Capital Requirement is calculated by determining individual components in respect of various specific risks that the Insurer is exposed to, and adding those components together to arrive at the Minimum Capital Requirement.\nAPP4.A4.2 Minimum Capital Requirement\nAPP4.A4.2.1 Subject to Rule ‎A4.2.2, an Insurer must calculate its Minimum Capital Requirement according to the formula:\nMCR = DRC + IVRC + OARC + OLRC + CRC + SFAC + URC + RRC + LIRC + AMRC\nWhere the following definitions apply:\n\n/Table Start\nTerm\tDefinition\nMCR\tInsurer's Minimum\n\n12\nan Insurer to set aside capital in respect of assets that it manages.  The circumstances under which an Insurer may conduct asset management activities are restricted by COBS.\nAPP4.A4.13.1 An Insurer must calculate its asset management risk component as 0.5% of the market value of assets managed by it.\nAPP4.A4.13.2 Assets that are recognised as assets of the Insurer in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not assets managed by it.\n\nAPP5 CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED NON CELLULAR CAPITAL RESOURCES AND ADJUSTED CELLULAR CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAPP5.A5.1 Purpose and general provisions\nAPP5.A5.1.1 This appendix applies to all Insurers to which Rule ‎4.4 applies.\nAPP5.A5.1.1.Guidance\nAPP5.A5.1.1.Guidance.1. This appendix sets out the manner in which an Insurer that is a Cell Company is required to calculate its Adjusted Non Cellular Capital Resources and the Adjusted Cellular Capital Resources applicable to each Cell.  The calculation is in each case analogous to that applicable to Insurers that are not Cell Companies, so that (except where changes are necessary to reflect structural differences) the capital of each Cell, and of the non cellular portion of the Insurer, is determined as though it was an Insurer subject to ‎APP3.\nAPP5.A5.1.1.Guidance.2. The Adjusted Non Cellular Capital Resources and Adjusted Cellular Capital Resources are calculated by making adjustments to the non cellular equity of the Insurer or cellular equity of the Cell, as at the Solvency Reference Date.\nAPP5.A5.1.1.Guidance.3. Provisions in respect of adjusted non cellular capital resources are set out in Rules ‎A5.2 to ‎A5.5.  Provisions in respect of adjusted cellular capital resources are set out in Rules ‎A5.6 to ‎A5.10.\nAPP5.A5.2 Adjusted Non Cellular Capital Resources\nAPP5.A5.2.1 An Insurer must calculate its Adjusted Non Cellular Capital Resources according to the formula:\nANCR = ANE – HNCA\nwhere:\nANCR means the Insurer's Adjusted Non Cellular Capital Resources;\nANE means the Insurer's adjusted non cellular equity; and\nHNCA means the Insurer's hybrid\n\n12\nwith a higher figure approved in writing by the Regulator.  The approved figure may not be more than the actual percentage which the fund hybrid capital represents of adjusted fund equity, and may not in any case exceed 30%.\n\nAPP8 CALCULATION OF MINIMUM FUND CAPITAL REQUIREMENT\nAPP8.A8.1 Purpose and general provisions\nAPP8.A8.1.1 This appendix applies to all Insurers to which Rule ‎4.5 applies.\nAPP8.A8.1.1.Guidance\nAPP8.A8.1.1.Guidance.1. This appendix sets out the manner in which an Insurer that conducts Long Term Insurance Business through a Long Term Insurance Fund is required to calculate the Minimum Fund Capital Requirement in respect of each Long Term Insurance Fund.\nAPP8.A8.1.1.Guidance.2. The Minimum Fund Capital Requirement is calculated on a basis that is analogous to the basis of calculation of the Minimum Capital Requirement for Insurers other than Cell Companies, as set out in ‎APP4.\nAPP8.A8.1.1.Guidance.3. The effect therefore is as though each Long Term Insurance Fund maintained by an Insurer were itself an Insurer that had to calculate a Minimum Capital Requirement in accordance with ‎APP4.  Consequently, this appendix incorporates references to the provisions of ‎APP4.\nAPP8.A8.2 Minimum Fund Capital Requirement\nAPP8.A8.2.1 Subject to Rule ‎A8.2.3, an Insurer must calculate the Minimum Fund Capital Requirement in respect of each Long Term Insurance Fund maintained by it, according to the formula:\nMFCR = DRC + IVRC + OARC + OLRC + CRC + SFAC + LIRC + AMRC\nwhere:\n/Table Start\nTerm\tDefinition\nMFCR\tMinimum Fund Capital Requirement in respect of the fund;\nDRC\tDefault risk component in respect of that fund;\nIVRC\tInvestment volatility risk component in respect of the fund;\nOARC\tOff balance sheet asset risk component in respect of the fund;\nOLRC\tOff balance sheet liability risk component in respect of the fund;\nCRC\tConcentration risk component in respect of the fund;\nSFAC\tSize Factor Adjustment Component in respect of the fund;\nLIRC\tLong Term Insurance risk component in respect of the fund; and\nAMRC\tAsset management risk component in respect of the\n\n12\nwith, or investment in, a Related entity, this Rule permits the Insurer to 'look through' the corporate arrangement and apply this appendix to the assets of the Related entity as though they were the Insurer's own.\nAPP6.A6.3.3 Where an Insurer that is a Cell Company arranges its affairs such that the Invested Assets of a segment are held in another segment of the same Insurer, the Insurer may, with the written approval of the Regulator, calculate relevant components of its Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement in respect of the first segment, by reference to the segment's interest in the assets that are held by the second segment, instead of by reference to the interest that the first segment has in the second segment.  In that case this appendix shall be interpreted as though the assets (representing the first segment's interest) held by the second segment were held directly by the first segment.\nAPP6.A6.3.3.Guidance\nAPP6.A6.3.3.Guidance.1. The effect of Rule ‎A6.3.3 is to extend the flexibility given by Rule ‎A6.3.2 to cover situations where one segment of an Insurer uses another segment of the same Insurer as a specialist investment entity.\nAPP6.A6.3.3.Guidance.2. Where Rule ‎A6.3.3 is applied, the Insurer still needs to calculate the Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement for the specialist investment segment, in respect of the Invested Assets which the specialist investment segment owns.  Two segments would therefore be required to hold capital in respect of those Invested Assets.\nAPP6.A6.4 Default risk component\nAPP6.A6.4.Guidance \nThe purpose of the default risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to cover the risk that amounts receivable from counterparties will not be received.  The basic calculation model for this component, as it applies to Insurers that are not Cell Companies, is set out in Rule ‎APP6.A4.4. The provisions in this section apply this basic model\n\n12\nother business.\n4.2.2.Guidance.7. Because an Insurer is required to maintain adequate capital resources at all times, its systems and controls need to enable the directors to determine and monitor the capital requirements of the Insurer and the capital resources that it has available, and to identify occurrences where the capital resources fall short of the capital requirements or may fall short in the future.  An Insurer is not required to measure the precise amount of its capital resources and its capital requirements on a daily basis.  However an Insurer should be in a position to demonstrate its capital adequacy at any time if asked to do so by the Regulator.\n4.3 Minimum Capital Requirement for Insurers that are not Cell Companies\n4.3.1 This section applies only to Insurers that are not Cell Companies.\n4.3.2 An Insurer that is not a Cell Company must always have Adjusted Capital Resources equal to or higher than the amount of its Minimum Capital Requirement.\n4.3.3 An Insurer's Adjusted Capital Resources must be calculated in accordance with ‎APP3.\n4.3.4 An Insurer's Minimum Capital Requirement must be calculated in accordance with ‎APP4.\n4.4 Minimum Capital Requirement for Insurers that are Companies\n4.4.1 This section applies only to Insurers that are Cell Companies.\n4.4.2 An Insurer that is a Company must ensure that the Insurer has at all times Adjusted Non Cellular Capital Resources equal to or higher than the amount of the Minimum Non Cellular Capital Requirement.\n4.4.3 An Insurer that is a Company must ensure that at all times, in respect of each of its Cells, the Insurer has Adjusted Cellular Capital Resources equal to or higher than the amount of the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement in respect of that Cell.\n4.4.4 The Adjusted Non Cellular Capital Resources in respect of an Insurer that is a Cell Company must be calculated in accordance with\n\n12\nthe difference between that aggregate and $250,000 must be added to the Minimum Non Cellular Capital Requirement.\n\n\nAPP6.A6.3 Applicability of components to assets of the Insurer\nAPP6.A6.3.1 Subject to Rules ‎A6.3.2 and ‎A6.3.3, an Insurer must calculate those components of a Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement that are relevant to assets, in respect of every asset that is attributable to that segment and that is available to meet liabilities attributable to that segment.\nAPP6.A6.3.2 Where an Insurer arranges its affairs such that Invested Assets attributable to a segment are held in a Related entity, the Insurer may, with the written approval of the Regulator, calculate components of the relevant Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement by reference to the Insurer's interest in the assets that are held by the Related entity, instead of by reference to the interest that the Insurer has in that Related entity.  In that case this appendix shall be interpreted as though the assets (representing the Insurer's interest) held by the Related entity were held directly by the Insurer.\nAPP6.A6.3.2.Guidance \nThe effect of Rule ‎A6.3.2 is to provide flexibility for Insurers whose investments are managed on a pooled basis within a Group, or which establish specialist Subsidiaries to manage their investments.  While the Insurer's asset in such cases is a balance with, or investment in, a Related entity, this Rule permits the Insurer to 'look through' the corporate arrangement and apply this appendix to the assets of the Related entity as though they were the Insurer's own.\nAPP6.A6.3.3 Where an Insurer that is a Cell Company arranges its affairs such that the Invested Assets of a segment are held in another segment of the same Insurer, the Insurer may, with the written approval of the Regulator, calculate relevant components of its Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement in respect of the first segment, by\n\n12\nshould be subject to approval and monitoring by senior management of the Insurer.\nAPP2.A2.15.Guidance.4. Where an Insurer relies upon functions that are performed at a Group level the protocols for the performance of those functions should be clear.\nAPP2.A2.15.Guidance.5. Senior management should establish and maintain systems and controls to identify and monitor the effect on the Insurer of its relationship with other members of the Group and the activities of other members of its Group.  These systems and controls should include procedures to monitor the following matters:\na.\tchanges in relationships between Group members;\nb.\tchanges in the activities of Group members;\nc.\tconflicts of interest arising within the Group; and\nd.\tevents in the Group, particularly those that may affect the Insurer's own regulatory compliance (for example, failures of control or compliance in other Group members).\nAPP2.A2.15.Guidance.6. The Insurer should have in place procedures to insulate the Insurer, so far as practicable, from potentially adverse effects of Group activities (for example, transfer pricing or fronting) or Group events that may expose the Insurer to risk.  Such procedures could include requirements for transactions with Group members to be at arm's length, and for maintenance of 'Chinese walls', and development of contingency plans.\nA2.15.Guidance.7.\tSenior management should take reasonable steps to ensure that:\na.\trelevant Group members are aware of the Insurer's Group risk management and reporting obligations;\nb.\tGroup capital and Group risk reporting requirements are complied with; and\nc.\tinformation in respect of the Group provided to the Regulator is of appropriate quality.\n\n\nAPP3 CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAPP3.A3.1 Purpose and general provisions\nAPP3.A3.1.1 This appendix applies to all Insurers to which Rule ‎4.3 applies.\nAPP3.A3.1.1.Guidance\nAPP3.A3.1.1.Guidance.1.
