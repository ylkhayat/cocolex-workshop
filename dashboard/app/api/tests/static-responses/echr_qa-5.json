The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. The protection of the prisoner’s correspondence with the lawyer requires the Member States to provide suitable guarantees preventing the reading of the letter such as opening the letter in the presence of the prisoner.

                "HELANDER v. FINLAND; § 1: . The applicant, Mr Jarno Kalevi Helander, is a Finnish national who was born in 1972 and lives in Konnunsuo. He was represented before the Court by Mr Ari Nieminen, a lawyer practising in Tampere.\n2: . The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. A. The circumstances of the case\n3: . The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n4: . In February 2008 the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention in Pyhäselkä prison. On Saturday 2 February 2008 at 8.15 p.m. his lawyer sent him an e-mail to the prison mailbox concerning another pending court case.\n5: . On Monday morning 4 February 2008 at 9.57 a.m. a prison official transferred the message to the prison director’s official e-mail address. On the same day at 2.38 p.m. the prison director contacted the sender of the message, informing him of the prison’s practice according to which confidential messages to prisoners should not be sent via the prison’s official e-mail address. Instead, he advised the sender to send a letter, telephone or visit to convey his message. As a ground for the refusal to receive e-mail messages, the prison director stated that the prison could not sufficiently verify the identity of the senders of such messages or their legitimacy as proper parties. Apparently, ten minutes later a new message was sent to the prison director’s e-mail address, insisting that he transmit the previous message, copied in this message, to the applicant. The sender referred to section 5 of the Act on Electronic Services and Communication in the Public Sector. In addition, the sender asked to be notified of the receipt of the message by the applicant, referring to a possibility of filing a complaint about the prison director, should he fail to comply with this request.\n6: . On 5 February 2008 the prison director replied to the sender, stating that the aforementioned Act did not impose any obligation to comply with the sender’s request, and that the prison was not going to transmit the message. He also repeated the reasoning already stated in his reply of 4 February 2008.\n7: . On 5 February 2008 the applicant asked the Joensuu District Court ( käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten ) to order the prison director to transmit the message to him and accused him of committing a crime in office.\n8: . On 13 February 2008 the prison director reported the matter to the police, asking them to investigate whether he had committed a crime in office. In this context he transmitted the message destined for the applicant to the police.\n9: . By letter dated 23 February 2008 the applicant asked the District Court to apply an interim measure ordering the prison director, under threat of payment of a penalty, to transmit the message to the applicant.\n10: . On 25 February 2008 the police completed the pre-trial investigation and sent the matter to the public prosecutor for consideration of possible charges.\n11: . On 7 March 2008 the District Court rejected the request for an interim measure. The court found that the conditions for granting an interim measure were not fulfilled.\n12: . By letter dated 13 March 2008 the applicant appealed to the Itä ‑ Suomi Court of Appeal ( hovioikeus, hovrätten ) against the decision of 7 March 2008.\n13: . On 15 April 2008 the Court of Appeal upheld the District Court’s decision.\n14: . On 20 April 2008 the applicant requested the public prosecutor to order the police to conduct an additional investigation into the matter to see whether the prison director had violated the confidentiality of the message by reading it and by transmitting it to the police. He also requested that charges be pressed. The applicant accepted the fact that the prison director had printed the message on paper but claimed that from that moment onwards it had to be considered as a letter, the confidentiality of which was protected by the Constitution. As the message had been included in the pre ‑ trial investigation report, it had become public. The applicant’s counsel had been sending e-mails destined for his clients imprisoned in different prisons in Finland for years and had never before encountered any problems in this respect.\n15: . By letter dated 9 May 2008 the public prosecutor informed the applicant that he was not going to press charges against the prison director. Moreover, he was not going to order any additional investigation into the matter.\n16: . On 13 May 2008 the applicant himself asked the police to investigate the additional issue, which the public prosecutor had refused to do. He also requested that charges be pressed.\n17: . On 4 June 2008 the police completed the additional investigation and sent the matter to the public prosecutor for consideration of possible charges.\n18: . By letter dated 12 June 2008 the public prosecutor informed the applicant that the additional investigation would not lead to any action on his part.\n19: . On 14 October 2008 the Joensuu District Court dismissed the charges against the prison director and rejected the applicant’s request that the message be transmitted to him. It found that everybody had a right to contact the authorities via e-mail if the technical or economic considerations allowed it. This right only applied to official matters and not to private issues, such as the matter in question in the present case. Therefore, the prison director had no obligation to pass on the message, nor had the applicant any right to receive it.\n20: . By letter dated 13 November 2008 the applicant appealed to the Itä ‑ Suomi Court of Appeal. The applicant pointed out that all correspondence destined for a detainee, whether a letter or an e-mail, arrived in the prison mail box and was scrutinised and passed on by the prison authorities. There was no reason to treat a printed e-mail differently from a letter. In fact, the former was safer as nothing extra could be passed to a detainee. The prison authorities could not rely on lack of technical or human resources as a ground to prevent lawyer-client contacts. No valid technical reason prevented the prison director from passing on the message to the applicant, since he had been able to pass it on to the police.\n21: . On 7 April 2009 the Itä-Suomi Court of Appeal upheld the District Court’s judgment.\n22: . By letter dated 3 June 2009 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court ( korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen ), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Court of Appeal. He also pointed out that the law provided no restrictions as concerned the form in which correspondence to a detainee had to be conveyed. If the prison authorities received a message destined for a detainee, they had an obligation to pass it on to him or her.\n23: . On 21 August 2009 the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal. B. Relevant domestic law and practice 1. Constitution\n24: . According to Article 10 of the Constitution of Finland ( Suomen perustuslaki, Finlands grundlag , Act no. 731/1999), the secrecy of correspondence, telephony and other confidential communications is inviolable. Provisions concerning limitations of the secrecy of communications which are necessary in the investigation of crimes that jeopardise the security of the individual or society or the sanctity of the home, at trials and security checks, as well as during the deprivation of liberty may be laid down by an Act.\n25: . According to Article 7 of the Constitution, the rights of individuals deprived of their liberty shall be guaranteed by an Act. The rights of convicted prisoners and pre-trial detainees and the necessary restrictions on these rights are regulated by the Prison Sentences Act and the Detention Act. 2. Prison Sentences Act\n26: . Chapter 12, section 1, subsection 1, of the Prison Sentences Act ( vankeuslaki, fängelselagen , Act no. 767/2005) provides that a prisoner has the right of correspondence. Any closed letter or other mail destined for the prisoner or sent by the prisoner may be checked by X-ray or by similar methods without opening the mail, in order to examine whether it contains prohibited substances or objects referred to in Chapter 9, section 1, subsection 1 or 2, of the Act.\n27: . Chapter 12, section 4, of the Act prohibits checking or reading a letter or other mail addressed by a prisoner to his or her advocate or other attorney or counsel referred to in Chapter 15, section 2, of the Code of Judicial Procedure ( oikeudenkäymiskaari, rättegångsbalken, as in force at the relevant time). If the cover of a letter or other mail destined for a prisoner or other circumstances reliably show that the sender is an attorney referred to in Chapter 12, section 4, subsection 1, of the Act, the mail may be opened and its contents may be checked without reading the message, and only in the presence of the prisoner, if there is reason to suspect that the letter or mail contains substances or objects referred to in Chapter 9, section 1, subsection 1 or 2.\n28: . Chapter 12, section 9, of the Act contains provisions on electronic communications by prisoners. This section provides that a prisoner may, for a special reason, be permitted to contact persons outside the prison by using electronic communications, telecommunications or other similar technical connections, provided that these connections do not endanger prison security. The provisions of Chapter 12, sections 2-5, 7, 10 and 11 of the Prison Sentences Act apply, mutatis mutandis, to the supervision of electronic communications.\n29: . The travaux préparatoires concerning Chapter 12, section 9, of the Act (Government Bill HE 263/2004 vp) read as follows: “At present prisoners have no right to have mobile phones or to contact persons outside the prison by using electronic communications, telecommunications or other similar technical connections. Most often telecommunications take place by mobile phone. The concept of ‘other electronic communications’ refers to contacts over the Internet. The use of electronic communications would be subject to a permit and require a special reason. As a rule, the provision would be applicable in open institutions. A special reason refers, for example, to the prisoner’s need to arrange his or her housing and employment before forthcoming release. If a prisoner is given the right to such contacts, the contacts could be supervised in the same manner as correspondence and telephone calls. This would mean the possibility of reading prisoners’ e-mails on the same conditions as their correspondence. This would also permit checking their e ‑ mail addresses.” 3. Detention Act\n30: . Chapter 8, section 6, of the Detention Act ( tutkintavankeuslaki, häktningslagen, Act no. 768/2005) provides that a pre-trial detainee must be given an opportunity to contact persons outside the prison by telephone at his or her own expense unless this right has been restricted under Chapter 1, section 18b, of the Coercive Measures Act ( pakkokeinolaki, tvångsmedelslagen , Act no. 450/1987). The prison regulations may set out rules concerning the time for using the telephone if such rules are necessary for the activities and order in the prison. Furthermore, a pre-trial detainee must be permitted to telephone his or her attorney and other persons outside the prison to deal with business which cannot be dealt with by letter or a visit.\n31: . According to Chapter 8, section 4, of the Detention Act (as modified by Act no. 266/2007), a letter or other mail addressed to a detainee by his counsel may be opened and its content checked, without reading the message, and only in the presence of the detainee, if there is reason to suspect that the letter contains an object or a substance capable of harming persons or destroying property.\n32: . Chapter 8, section 5, of the Act provides that a letter, mail or message destined for a detainee may be withheld, if passing it on would endanger the purpose of the pre-trial detention or if the withholding is necessary for the prevention or solving of crime, prevention of disorder in the prison or for the safety of the detainee or other persons. 4. Act on Electronic Services and Communication in the Public Sector\n33: . The Act on Electronic Services and Communication in the Public Sector ( laki sähköisestä asioinnista viranomaistoiminnassa, lagen om elektronisk kommunikation i myndigheternas verksamhet , Act no. 13/2003), contains provisions on electronic communications related to authorities’ activities. Section 2 of the Act provides that the Act applies to: “lodging of administrative, judicial, prosecution and enforcement matters, to the consideration and to the service of decisions of such matters by electronic means, unless otherwise provided by statute. The Act applies, where appropriate, also to other activities of the authorities.”\n34: . According to section 5 of the Act: “an authority in possession of the requisite technical, financial and other resources shall, within the bounds of these, offer to the public the option to send a message to a designated electronic address or other designated device in order to lodge a matter or to have it considered. Furthermore, the authority shall offer to the public the option to deliver statutory or ordered notifications, requested accounts and other similar documents and messages by electronic means.”\n35: . The Parliamentary Ombudsman, in his decision of 24 August 2010 (no. 2335/4/08) concerning a certain case in a Finnish prison, considered that, by virtue of the current legislation, prison authorities have no obligation to deliver electronic messages to prisoners, and that obliging them to deliver an electronic message to a prisoner requires more precise provisions in the relevant legislation. In this connection, the Parliamentary Ombudsman has generally stated that it would be desirable that such messages be delivered to prisoners in individual cases, provided that this does not endanger prison security and the confidentiality of the message can be secured. C. Relevant international standards\n36: . The Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2006)2 on European Prison Rules, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 11 January 2006, provides, inter alia , the following: “24.1 Prisoners shall be allowed to communicate as often as possible by letter, telephone or other forms of communication with their families, other persons and representatives of outside organisations and to receive visits from these persons. 24.2 Communication and visits may be subject to restrictions and monitoring necessary for the requirements of continuing criminal investigations, maintenance of good order, safety and security, prevention of criminal offences and protection of victims of crime, but such restrictions, including specific restrictions ordered by a judicial authority, shall nevertheless allow an acceptable minimum level of contact. 24.3 National law shall specify national and international bodies and officials with whom communication by prisoners shall not be restricted. ... 24.5 Prison authorities shall assist prisoners in maintaining adequate contact with the outside world and provide them with the appropriate welfare support to do so.” COMPLAINTS\n37: . The applicant complained under Article 6 § 3 (b) and (c) of the Convention that he had not been able to prepare his defence or defend himself through legal assistance as the lawyer-client correspondence had been hindered by the prison authorities. He complained that the right to respect for his correspondence under Article 8 of the Convention had been violated when his lawyer’s e-mail message was not delivered to him and it became public by being submitted to the police and included in the pre-trial investigation report. Finally, he claimed that this fact also violated his right to receive messages under Article 10 of the Convention. THE LAW A. Alleged violation of Article 8 of the Convention\n38: . The applicant complained under Article 8 of the Convention that his right to respect for correspondence had been violated when his lawyer’s e ‑ mail message was not delivered to him by the prison authorities and it became public due to the fact that it had been included in the pre-trial investigation report.\n39: . Article 8 of the Convention reads as follows: “1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\n40: . The Government argued that as the electronic message in question had been submitted to the common electronic mailbox of a prison, it did not fall within the scope of the applicant’s correspondence. The recipient of the letter was the prison, not the applicant. Even though the message had been accompanied by a request to transmit it to the applicant, it had not been clear whether it had been intended for the applicant or the prison. This complaint should therefore be rejected as being incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention. In any event, the applicant had not suffered any significant disadvantage. The electronic mail message in question had neither been of significant importance to the applicant, nor urgent in its nature. The sender had been clearly and promptly informed that the message could not be submitted by e-mail and had been instructed to use other means of communication. In any event, the Government claimed that this complaint was manifestly ill-founded.\n41: . The Government pointed out that the prison director had immediately informed the sender that the message had not been delivered to the applicant and had informed him of the proper ways of communicating with prisoners in the said prison. After this it had been up to the sender to deliver the message anew by using the accepted means of communication and any failure to do so could not be imputed to the Government. In the Government’s view the applicant’s right to communicate with his lawyers had not been restricted, nor had it been demonstrated that he suffered any harm. There was thus no interference with the applicant’s right to respect for his correspondence.\n42: . The Government stressed that the main principle in both the Prison Sentences Act and the Detention Act was that a prisoner’s contacts with his or her attorney took place by post, telephone or visits. A prisoner held in an open institution might, for a special reason, be permitted to use electronic communication, telecommunication or other technical connections if such permission was given by the prison director. In the present case the applicant had not requested such permission for his correspondence with his attorney or notified the prison of an upcoming e ‑ mail. The prison in question was a closed one and it did not even grant the prisoners permission to use electronic mail or mobile phones. At the relevant time, the applicant had been both a convicted prisoner and in pre ‑ trial detention and fell thus mainly under the Prison Sentences Act. However, that Act, or the Detention Act, did not contain any provision giving civilians or attorneys a possibility to send e-mail messages to prisoners. Nor did the Act on Electronic Services and Communication in the Public Sector apply to such situations. The domestic legislation thus did not impose any positive obligation on prison authorities to transmit messages sent to their e-mail addresses to prisoners.\n43: . The Government noted that Finnish prisons did not currently have technical facilities for verifying the identity of the sender of an e-mail. In cases in which an attorney contacted a prisoner through the prison e-mail address, it was not possible to verify the authorisation of the attorney to act as an agent either. Permitting the use of e-mail in such cases would require legislative amendments. The introduction of such amendments was currently being examined by the Ministry of Justice. However, there was an additional problem because in such situations the prison authorities were compelled to read the contents of the attorney’s messages and thus violate the express confidentiality prohibitions laid down in the Prison Sentences Act and in the Detention Act. The content of a confidential e-mail might be disclosed when the prison staff opened it or when it was printed out to be delivered to a prisoner. Moreover, the Government pointed out that the applicant’s attorney had only become a member of the Bar Association three months after the impugned e-mail message was sent.\n44: . The Government maintained that the delivery of the e-mail message to the pre-trial investigation authorities was necessary in the present case for investigative purposes. The e-mail message was not made public but was represented as a piece of evidence in the police investigation, which was not public. Moreover, the prison authorities had no right to disclose the fact that a person was in prison. Therefore the domestic legislation was so designed that only a prisoner had the right to initiate contacts. The impugned measures were thus in compliance with the Prison Sentences Act, the Detention Act and the current prison practice. They were necessary in a democratic society and pursued the legitimate aims of ensuring the security of prisons and prisoners as well as prevention of crime.\n45: . The applicant pointed out that the Court had expressly stated in its case-law that e-mails were protected by Article 8 of the Convention. He also disagreed with the Government that there had been no significant disadvantage. The significance of correspondence between him and his attorney or the disclosure of such a message was not to be assessed afterwards by the prison director, nor by the Government. Interference with the correspondence between an attorney and a client did constitute a significant disadvantage.\n46: . The applicant argued that the level of privacy of his correspondence with his attorney in the prison was his own decision. If he wanted to send postcards to his attorney, no law could prevent it even if that practice raised the same questions as the present case. The fact that the message could be read by others did not make it public. Moreover, the verification of the sender of an attorney’s e-mail was much easier than verifying the sender of postcards or even letters. The official e-mail addresses of attorneys could be found on the internet site of the Finnish Bar Association. In the present case the sender’s identity was clear, at least after the telephone call made by the prison director. As there had been no doubt about the sender, the message should have been passed on to the applicant.\n47: . The applicant denied having given permission to make his correspondence public outside the prison. Even if he was used to the idea that correspondence within the prison was not necessarily private, at least it should be so outside the prison walls. It was absurd that a prisoner could send e-mails but not receive them even though correspondence was by definition reciprocal.\n48: . The Court notes first of all that even though the electronic message in question was submitted to the prison’s common electronic mailbox, it was nevertheless destined for the applicant and accompanied with a request that it be transmitted to him. There is therefore an issue about correspondence which falls within the scope of Article 8 and which the applicant may have the right to receive. In such circumstances the applicant might expect that the correspondence he receives is protected by Article 8 of the Convention (compare and contrast Copland v. the United Kingdom , no. 62617/00, §§ 41-42, ECHR 2007 ‑ I). The electronic message sent to the applicant would then fall within the scope of his correspondence for the purposes of Article 8 § 1 of the Convention.\n49: . The Court reiterates that the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by public authorities. There may in addition be positive obligations inherent in ensuring effective “respect” for the rights guaranteed by that Article. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for rights even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see, for example, Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands , 27 October 1994, § 31, Series A no. 297 ‑ C; and Mikulić v. Croatia , no. 53176/99, § 57, ECHR 2002 ‑ I). However, the boundaries between the State’s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Keegan v. Ireland , 26 May 1994, § 49, Series A no. 290; and Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands , cited above).\n50: . The Court reiterates that its task is not to substitute itself for the competent domestic authorities in regulating prisoners’ correspondence at the national level, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis , Różański v. Poland , no. 55339/00 , § 62, 18 May 2006; Mikulić v. Croatia , cited above, § 59; and Hokkanen v. Finland , 23 September 1994, § 55, Series A no. 299 ‑ A). The Court will therefore examine whether the respondent State has in the present case complied with its positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention.\n51: . The Court notes that, at the time of the relevant facts, the domestic legislation did not provide for a possibility for a prisoner to receive e-mails. The Government noted in their observations that neither the Prison Sentences Act nor the Detention Act contained any provision giving civilians or attorneys a possibility to send e-mail messages to prisoners. Nor did the Act on Electronic Services and Communication in the Public Sector apply to such situations. The domestic legislation thus did not impose any positive obligation on prison authorities to transmit messages sent to their e ‑ mail addresses to prisoners.\n52: . The Court notes that the domestic law is based on the principle that a prisoner’s contacts with his or her attorney are made by post, telephone or visits. Similar principles are found in the European Prison Rules, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 11 January 2006. In the present case the question arises of whether these existing means of communication are sufficient or whether a prisoner should also have the right to receive e ‑ mails. The Government have put forward several considerations supporting the view that the above-mentioned means are sufficient or that, at least, the choice of introducing a possibility of receiving e-mails should be left to the legislators, as with the Ministry of Justice which is currently examining this possibility.\n53: . The Court agrees with the Government. The Finnish legal system in respect of prisoners’ correspondence is drafted clearly and fulfils the requirements of the Convention and the positive obligations imposed on the respondent State. Even though no positive obligation to allow the use of e ‑ mails exists, there are alternative means of effective communication. Moreover, there are legitimate reasons not to allow e-mails as long as the legislation remains unchanged. One of the main reasons is that the current legislation cannot guarantee lawyer-client confidentiality if the communication is made by e-mail.\n54: . As to the proportionality, the Court finds that in the present case the refusal by the domestic authorities to transmit the e-mail message to the applicant cannot be regarded as disproportionate either. The sender of the e ‑ mail message was immediately informed about the non-delivery of the message and he was instructed to use the proper means of communication. He thus had available several means of communication which provided the same effectiveness and rapidity of communication as the use of e-mails. The fact that he failed to use these means is not attributable to the respondent State.\n55: . Moreover, the fact that the e-mail message in question was included in the pre-trial investigation file cannot be regarded as disproportionate either. This measure was necessary for the investigation of the applicant’s complaints before the domestic courts. Contrary to the applicant’s claims, this inclusion did not mean that the e-mail message in question became public as the pre-trial investigation records remain confidential.\n56: . Hence, having regard to the margin of appreciation left to the State, the Court considers that the refusal by the domestic authorities to transmit the e-mail message in question to the applicant cannot be regarded as unjustified for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention. In particular, a fair balance was struck between the different interests involved. In sum, the applicant’s right to respect for his correspondence was secured. Accordingly, this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly ill ‑ founded and declared inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention. B. Remainder of the application\n57: . The applicant also complained under Article 6 § 3 (b) and (c) of the Convention that he could not prepare his defence or defend himself through legal assistance as the lawyer-client correspondence had been prevented by the prison authorities. Lastly, he complained that the fact that he did not receive the e-mail also violated his right to receive messages under Article 10 of the Convention.\n58: Having regard to the case file, the Court finds that the matters complained of do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the applicant’s rights under the Convention. Accordingly, also this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.\nFor these reasons, the Court unanimously\nDeclares\n the application inadmissible.\nFrançoise Elens-Passos\n \nIneta Ziemele\n \nRegistrar\n \nPresident"

                "CASE OF CAMPBELL v. THE UNITED KINGDOM; § 1: The case was referred to the Court on 12 October 1990 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") and by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\"the Government\") on 22 November 1990, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 13590/88) against the  lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 14 January 1986 by Thomas Campbell, a British citizen.\n2: In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings pending and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n3: The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir Vincent Evans, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 30 October 1990, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr J. Pinheiro Farinha, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr I. Foighel, Mr R. Pekkanen and Mr J.M. Morenilla (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently Sir John Freeland, the newly elected judge of British nationality, who had taken up his duties before the hearing, replaced Sir Vincent Evans who had resigned (Rule 2 para. 3).\n4: Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the applicant’s representative on the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 para. 1).\n5: Having consulted, through the Registrar, those who would be appearing before the Court, the President directed on 3 December 1990 that the hearing should open on 23 September 1991 (Rule 38).\n6: The hearing took place in public in the , , on the appointed day. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. Mr Cremona, Vice-President of the Court, replaced Mr Ryssdal who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 21 para. 5, second sub-paragraph).\n7: The Court heard addresses by Mr Rodger for the Government, by Mr Rozakis for the Commission and by Mr Carroll for the applicant, as well as replies to questions put by the Court. The applicant and the Government filed further submissions concerning Article 50 (art. 50) on 2 and 29 October 1991.\n8: On 10 October 1984 the applicant was convicted of assault and murder at the High Court, , and was sentenced to life imprisonment. One of the offences involved setting fire to the front door of a flat thereby killing six of the nine members of one family asleep there at the time. A recommendation was made by the trial judge that he should serve not less that twenty years’ imprisonment in view, inter alia, of the appalling nature of the crimes and his previous criminal record which indicated that he was \"a ruthless man of violence\".\n9: Since his imprisonment the applicant had been advised by his solicitor in respect of:\n10: On 16 September 1985, the applicant’s solicitor wrote to the Governor of Peterhead Prison, asking that all correspondence between him and his client should pass without interference. After having discussed the matter with the applicant, the Deputy Governor wrote on 23 September 1985 to the applicant’s solicitor indicating that outgoing mail from the applicant to his solicitor concerning his petition to the Commission, if properly marked so as to indicate that it concerned the Convention, would not be opened.\n11: In a further letter dated 4 October 1985 to the Governor of Peterhead Prison his solicitor claimed that the letter of 16 September had not been answered in its entirety as he had been given no assurance by the Deputy Governor that letters to Mr Campbell would not be subject to interference. On 15 October 1985 the Deputy Governor replied that incoming mail from solicitors concerning an application to the Commission, suitably identified by placing (a) the name of the solicitor’s firm and (b) the initials ECHR in a prominent position on the envelope, would be opened in the presence of the prisoner and handed to him unread (see paragraph 25 below). The Deputy Governor explained that this arrangement would not apply to solicitors’ correspondence about matters other than the application to the Commission.\n12: On 24 October 1985 the applicant’s solicitor wrote to the Scottish Home and Health Department (\"SHHD\"), the Government department concerned with the administration of prisons in , again requesting that all of his correspondence to the applicant should be allowed to pass to him without interference.\n13: On 29 October 1985 the applicant petitioned the Secretary of State for  complaining about censorship of his correspondence with his solicitor. In their reply of 19 June 1986 to this and other petitions the SHHD advised the applicant that his solicitors had been informed by the Deputy Governor, Peterhead, on 15 October 1985 that correspondence \"in respect of ECHR procedures\" should be clearly marked to ensure privacy but that any other correspondence between an inmate and his legal advisers was subject to scrutiny under standing instructions to prison establishments.\n14: On 16 June 1986 the SHHD wrote to the applicant’s solicitor confirming the arrangements for solicitors’ correspondence concerning matters before the Commission but reaffirming that other correspondence was still subject to the normal rules which provided for the opening and reading of all letters to and from a prisoner (see paragraphs 19-22 below).\n15: On 19 June 1986 the applicant again complained that incoming mail from his solicitor was scrutinised. He repeated these complaints on 27 June 1986. In these petitions, the applicant also drew the attention of the authorities to the fact that correspondence to and from the European Commission of Human Rights was being opened. The reply from the SHHD, received by the applicant on 15 July 1986, referred to the existing arrangements as discussed in correspondence between his solicitor and management at Peterhead Prison in September and October 1985.\n16: In a letter dated 16 June 1987 to the applicant’s solicitor, the SHHD confirmed that the rules relating to prisoners’ correspondence were under review in the light of the friendly settlement reached in the case of McComb (application no. 10621/83, report of the Commission dated 15 May 1986 - see paragraph 23 below). The applicant’s solicitor was advised that, pending the outcome of discussions between the SHHD and the Law Society of Scotland, the current rules would continue to apply to correspondence between a prisoner and his legal adviser; in particular, only correspondence concerning matters before the Commission would be allowed to pass unopened.\n17: The applicant’s solicitor applied for legal aid to bring civil proceedings in respect of the interference with the applicant’s correspondence. Legal aid was refused on 7 October 1986 by the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee on the ground that the applicant had no probable cause of action. The Committee also noted that the applicant was not being denied visits from his legal advisers and that he had not indicated that he was unable to give instructions verbally to his advisers. The applicant’s appeal against this decision was refused on 5 December 1986 by the Legal Aid Central Committee of the Law Society of Scotland.\n18: At the relevant time the prison system in  was governed by the Prisons () Act 1952 (\"the 1952 Act\"), which has since been repealed. Similar provisions were re-enacted in the Prisons () Act 1989.\n19: Communications between prisoners and their legal advisers and others are governed principally by Rule 74 of the rules. Rule 74 (4) provides that - subject to one exception which is not relevant in the present case - \"every letter to or from a prisoner shall be read by the Governor or by an officer deputed by him for that purpose\".\n20: In the case of remand prisoners, Rule 124 (2) provides that they shall be allowed to write to their legal advisers. Under Rule 124 (3) any confidential written communications prepared by such a prisoner as instructions for his legal adviser may be delivered to the legal adviser without being examined by any officer of the prison unless the Governor has reason to suppose that it contains matters not relating to such instructions. Under Rule 127 this facility is also available to convicted prisoners who are the subject of further charges. Similar provisions apply under Rule 132 (2) to an appellant in connection with his appeal.\n21: These rules are supplemented by Standing Order M, which deals in detail with communications between prisoners and others. Copies of this Standing Order are available to prisoners and the public. Standing Order Ma1 (a) sets out the purpose of examination of the correspondence, namely to prevent its use to plan escapes or disturbances or otherwise jeopardise the security of the establishment and to satisfy other reasonable requirements of prison administration. Under Standing Order Ma1 (d), when correspondence is examined or read this is to be done as quickly as possible.\n22: Most correspondence with legal advisers is governed by Standing Order Ma6 (e) which concerns general correspondence. Under Standing Order Ma7 such correspondence:\n23: Following the friendly settlement of 15 May 1986 in the case of McComb v. the United Kingdom (application no. 10621/83, report of the Commission, Decisions and Reports (DR) no. 50, pp. 81-89), new procedures dealing with correspondence between a prisoner and his legal adviser in respect of legal proceedings which have been instituted came into force on 21 March 1988, as set out in Standing Order Ma8:\n24: Standing Order M also contains specific provisions relating to correspondence with the European Commission or Court of Human Rights or with a legal adviser in connection with a petition to the Commission or pending proceedings before the Commission or the Court. Under Standing Order Ma10 such correspondence may not contain material prohibited under Standing Order Ma7 (a) to (c) or (e) (see paragraph 22 above).\n25: Further general provisions relating to the Convention are to be found in Standing Orders Ma1 (b) and Mf. In particular, Standing Order Mf7 expressly provides that correspondence between an inmate and his legal adviser about a petition to the Commission or proceedings resulting therefrom should not be read unless the Governor has reason to suppose that the correspondence contains other matters.\n26: The Government state that, in practice, as regards correspondence between prisoners and the Commission, outgoing letters if sealed will normally go unopened. Incoming letters from the Commission are opened; the contents are examined to confirm that they are what they purport to be but they are not read; they are thereafter issued promptly to the prisoner.\n27: Mr Campbell lodged his application with the Commission on 14 January 1986 (no. 13590/88). He complained of interference by the prison authorities with his correspondence with his solicitor, the Commission and a Member of Parliament contrary to Articles 8 and 10 (art. 8, art. 10) of the Convention. He also complained of a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention in that he had been refused legal aid to challenge in the civil courts the actions of the prison authorities in respect of his correspondence.\n28: On 8 November 1989 the Commission found admissible the complaint that correspondence with his solicitor and the Commission had been opened by the prison authorities in violation of his right to respect for correspondence under Article 8 (art. 8). It declared the other complaints inadmissible but decided to examine further whether the opening of the applicant’s correspondence with the Commission was compatible with Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1) of the Convention.\n29: At the hearing on 23 September 1991 the Government invited the Court to hold that:\n30: The applicant complained that correspondence to and from his solicitor and the Commission was opened and read by the prison authorities in breach of Article 8 (art. 8) which reads:\n31: Both the Government and the Commission have made reference to the European Agreement relating to persons participating in proceedings of the European Commission and Court of Human Rights of 6 May 1969 (\"the European Agreement\"). This Agreement is distinct from the Convention and is binding on twenty Contracting Parties, including the  from 1971. It also applies to the applicant and his solicitor (Article 1 para. 1 (b) and (c)).\n32: The Government maintained that the applicant had not substantiated his claims of an interference with the right to respect for correspondence to and from his solicitor since he did not specify any letter which he said was opened and related to pending proceedings. In their view the applicant was required to substantiate his claims and had failed to do so. Moreover, at the hearing they stressed that the applicant’s complaint only related to the opening, and not to the reading, of his correspondence.\n33: The Court cannot accept these arguments. It notes in the first place that from the outset in his application to the Commission of 14 January 1986 the applicant complained that \"his correspondence with his solicitors and the European Commission of Human Rights has regularly been subjected to interference in so far as it has been opened, perused, scrutinised and censored by the prison authorities\". He added that he was restricted in his contacts with his solicitor and the Commission because he knew that \"this correspondence will be read (...) and noted by the prison authorities\". The Court further observes that the Government did not dispute that the applicant’s incoming and outgoing correspondence with his solicitor, other than that concerning a petition to the Commission, could be examined under the Prison Rules. Indeed, the SHHD had informed the applicant and his solicitor that this correspondence was subject to the existing rules which provided for the opening and reading of such letters (see paragraphs 13-14 above). In these circumstances, the applicant can claim to be a victim of an interference with his right to respect for correspondence under Article 8 (art. 8).\n34: Such interference amounts to a violation of this provision unless it was \"in accordance with the law\", had an aim or aims that is or are legitimate under Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2) and was \"necessary in a democratic society\" for the aforesaid aim or aims (see, amongst many others, the Kruslin v. France judgment of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A, p. 20, para. 26).\n35: In paragraph 51 of its report the Commission noted that it was not disputed between the parties that the measure complained of was in conformity with Scottish law. The applicant did not comment on this statement in writing, but he submitted for the first time at the hearing that the interference with his correspondence was not in accordance with the law. He questioned the legal validity of the power to open correspondence under the Prison Rules and Standing Orders on the grounds that it is a criminal offence under section 56 of the Post Office Act 1953 to \"prevent or impede\" the delivery of the post and that the Secretary of State had in effect granted himself a general search warrant which is unlawful under the law of Scotland.\n36: Both the Government and the Commission considered that the interference with the applicant’s correspondence was based on the Prison (Scotland) Rules 1952 (as amended) made by the Secretary of State in pursuance of his statutory powers under section 35 of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1952 and supplemented by Standing Orders which were published and available to prisoners and the general public.\n37: Although the phrase \"in accordance with the law\" refers in the first place to national law, it is not, in principle, for the Court to examine the validity of secondary legislation. This is primarily a matter which falls within the competence of national courts which in the present case have examined and upheld the validity of the prison rule providing for the opening and reading of prisoners’ correspondence (see paragraph 19 above). In the circumstances the Court sees no reason to call into question the findings of the national court.\n38: Accordingly, the Court, like the Commission, finds that the interference was \"in accordance with the law\" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).\n39: The applicant did not accept that the purpose of the interference with his correspondence was the \"prevention of disorder or crime\", within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2). As regards incoming mail, he suggested that the aim of the prison authorities was not to check for prohibited material but to learn of the contents of letters before the prisoner did.\n40: The Government submitted that such correspondence was opened for \"the prevention of disorder or crime\" in pursuit of a legitimate aim in terms of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2). The Commission agreed.\n41: In the Court’s view there is no reason to doubt that the control of the applicant’s correspondence was carried out under the Prison Rules and Standing Orders to ensure inter alia that it did not contain material which was harmful to prison security or the safety of others or was otherwise of a criminal nature. The interference thus pursued the legitimate aim of \"the prevention of disorder or crime\" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).\n42: The applicant contested the necessity of opening and examining letters to and from his solicitor. He pointed out that many of the items of correspondence with his solicitor concerned legal actions or complaints against prison officials who had an interest in protecting their positions. It was unjust that they and their colleagues should be allowed access to what was essentially private information and legal advice. Such access was susceptible to abuse in view of the solidarity which existed amongst prison staff.\n43: The Government did not contest that, if correspondence relating to pending proceedings had been routinely opened, there would have been a breach of Article 8 (art. 8). They limited their plea in this context to maintaining that the applicant had not substantiated his complaint (see paragraph 32 above). Nor did they seek to argue that there existed any particular suspicion in respect of the applicant’s mail on account of his own or his solicitor’s personal circumstances.\n44: The Court recalls that the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In determining whether an interference is \"necessary in a democratic society\" regard may be had to the State’s margin of appreciation (see, amongst other authorities, The Sunday Times v. the  (no. 2) judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 217, pp. 28-29, para. 50).\n45: It has also been recognised that some measure of control over prisoners’ correspondence is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention, regard being paid to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment (see the Silver and Others v. the  judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 38, para. 98). In assessing the permissible extent of such control in general, the fact that the opportunity to write and to receive letters is sometimes the prisoner’s only link with the outside world should, however, not be overlooked.\n46: It is clearly in the general interest that any person who wishes to consult a lawyer should be free to do so under conditions which favour full and uninhibited discussion. It is for this reason that the lawyer-client relationship is, in principle, privileged. Indeed, in its S. v.  judgment of 28 November 1991 the Court stressed the importance of a prisoner’s right to communicate with counsel out of earshot of the prison authorities. It was considered, in the context of Article 6 (art. 6), that if a lawyer were unable to confer with his client without such surveillance and receive confidential instructions from him his assistance would lose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective (Series A no. 220, pp. 15-16, para. 48; see also, in this context, the Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80, p. 49, paras. 111-113).\n47: In the Court’s view, similar considerations apply to a prisoner’s correspondence with a lawyer concerning contemplated or pending proceedings where the need for confidentiality is equally pressing, particularly where such correspondence relates, as in the present case, to claims and complaints against the prison authorities. That such correspondence be susceptible to routine scrutiny, particularly by individuals or authorities who may have a direct interest in the subject matter contained therein, is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client.\n48: Admittedly, as the Government pointed out, the borderline between mail concerning contemplated litigation and that of a general nature is especially difficult to draw and correspondence with a lawyer may concern matters which have little or nothing to do with litigation. Nevertheless, the Court sees no reason to distinguish between the different categories of correspondence with lawyers which, whatever their purpose, concern matters of a private and confidential character. In principle, such letters are privileged under Article 8 (art. 8).\n49: The Government have argued that the opening of the applicant’s correspondence did not prevent him from having an effective opportunity to communicate in confidence with his solicitor during prison visits. By way of analogy they pointed out that Article 3 para. 2 (c) of the European Agreement only guaranteed, in the context of proceedings before the Strasbourg organs, the confidentiality of legal consultations with a prisoner during a visit. In a commentary to the Agreement, the Committee of Experts on Human Rights considered that correspondence between a prisoner and his lawyer, in this context, was susceptible to examination by the competent authorities (report to the Committee of Ministers, 27 October 1969, para. 58, H (69)15.)\n50: However, these arguments do not answer the applicant’s complaint. In the first place, the provisions of the European Agreement are not to be interpreted as limiting the obligations assumed under the Convention, as indicated by Article 6 of the Agreement. They thus cannot be interpreted as prejudicing the rights guaranteed in the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Ekbatani v.  judgment of 26 May 1988, Series A. no. 134, p. 13, para. 26). Moreover, the application of Article 3 para. 2 (c) is subject to the safeguards contained in Article 3 para. 3 which raise problems of interpretation similar to those raised by Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2) of the Convention. It therefore offers little clarification of the point at issue and cannot be construed as permitting the opening of such correspondence under Article 8 (art. 8).\n51: The Government have also argued that the professional competence and integrity of solicitors could not always be relied on. The Government added that they not infrequently broke their disciplinary rules and various abuses had come to light since the coming into force of the new rules in respect of correspondence relating to pending proceedings. Moreover, if it were known that all correspondence with solicitors would pass unopened there existed a risk that they would become the target of pressure from those wishing to smuggle forbidden material into or out of prisons. Since drugs or even explosives could be concealed within an ordinary letter this was a real risk. It was thus wholly proportionate for the authorities to minimise risks of this kind by opening such letters.\n52: The Court, however, is not persuaded by these submissions. The possibility of examining correspondence for reasonable cause (see paragraph 48 above) provides a sufficient safeguard against the possibility of abuse. It must also be borne in mind that solicitors in  are officers of the court and are subject to disciplinary sanctions by the Law Society of Scotland for professional misconduct. It has not been suggested that there was any reason to suspect that the applicant’s solicitor was not complying with the rules of his profession. In sum, the mere possibility of abuse is outweighed by the need to respect the confidentiality attached to the lawyer-client relationship.\n53: There being no further room for allowing for a margin of appreciation, the Court finds that there was no pressing social need for the opening and reading of the applicant’s correspondence with his solicitor and that, accordingly, this interference was not \"necessary in a democratic society\" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).\n54: Accordingly, there has been a breach of Article 8 (art. 8) in this respect.\n55: The applicant further complained under this provision that his mail to and from the Commission had been opened and read.\n56: The Government maintained that letters to the Commission are not normally opened and that the applicant had not substantiated his claim of an interference in this respect. On the other hand, they stated that letters from the Commission were opened, but not read, to ensure that they actually came from the Commission.\n57: The applicant’s outgoing mail to the Commission was not, in practice, subject to scrutiny (see paragraphs 13, 16 and 25-26 above) and there is no indication that any such letters have been opened. The Court therefore finds that it has not been established that such outgoing mail had been opened. However, the practice of opening letters from the Commission, whether or not they were read, amounts to an interference with the applicant’s right to respect for correspondence which falls to be justified, in accordance with the Court’s case-law (see paragraph 45 above), under Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).\n58: The applicant contested that the opening of his correspondence was \"in accordance with the law\" (see paragraph 35 above).\n59: The Court rejects his arguments for the reasons outlined above (see paragraphs 35-37). The opening of letters from the Commission was based, inter alia, on the Standing Orders which were published and available (see paragraph 18 above). The interference was thus \"in accordance with the law\".\n60: Although the applicant argued that the interference did not pursue a legitimate aim (see paragraph 39 above) the Court sees no reason to doubt that the letters were opened for \"the prevention of disorder or crime\" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2) (see paragraph 41 above).\n61: The Government claimed that the prison authorities were entitled to open letters from the Commission to confirm that they were what they purported to be. In their view, there existed a risk that letters which appeared to come from the Commission could be used as a channel for illicit materials. In addition, the opening of correspondence from the Commission was compatible with Article 3 para. 2 (a) of the European Agreement. Some clarification of the intention of the drafters of the Convention was thus provided on this point.\n62: For its part, the Court considers that it is of importance to respect the confidentiality of mail from the Commission since it may concern allegations against the prison authorities or prison officials. Indeed, the need for confidentiality in this context is reflected in the rules concerning outgoing mail to the Commission (see paragraph 25 above). The opening of letters from the Commission undoubtedly gives rise to the possibility that they will be read and may also conceivably, on occasions, create the risk of reprisals by the prison staff against the prisoner concerned.\n63: Finally, for the reasons indicated above (see paragraph 50), the provisions of the Agreement cannot be invoked to limit the scope of Article 8 (art. 8). In addition, Article 3 para. 2 (a) of the European Agreement merely provides that if the correspondence of persons under detention is opened \"its despatch and delivery shall nevertheless take place without undue delay and without alteration\". Its purpose is thus to ensure that mail shall not be stopped or delayed or altered.\n64: Accordingly, the Court finds that the opening of letters from the Commission was not \"necessary in a democratic society\" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2). There has thus been a breach of Article 8 (art. 8) in this respect also.\n65: Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1) provides:\n66: The question of compliance with this provision was raised ex officio by the Commission but was not pursued before the Court. There is no reason to examine this matter.\n67: Article 50 (art. 50) provides as follows:\n68: The applicant claimed £3,000 by way of compensation for the interference with his correspondence. At the hearing his lawyer claimed that an award of compensation might discourage the Government from interfering with prisoners’ correspondence.\n69: The Government and the Delegate of the Commission considered that no award of damage should be made.\n70: The Court considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the finding of breaches of Article 8 (art. 8) constitutes sufficient just satisfaction under this head for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50).\n71: The applicant claimed £9,257.69 by way of costs and expenses. This amount related to solicitor’s fees and disbursements for work done in  and in connection with the proceedings before the Convention institutions. No claims were made for travel and subsistence expenses which were covered by the grant of legal aid from the Council of Europe. The applicant has received by way of legal aid 7,205 French francs in respect of fees.\n72: Neither the Government nor the Delegate of the Commission disagreed with the above claim.\n73: The Court holds that the applicant should be awarded the amount claimed, namely £9,257.69 less 7,205 French francs already paid by way of legal aid in respect of fees. This figure is to be increased by any value-added tax that may be chargeable."

                "CASE OF ERDEM v. GERMANY; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 38321/97) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Selahattin Erdem (“the applicant”), on 29 July 1997.\n2: The applicant was represented by Mr Schultz, a lawyer practising in . The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Stoltenberg, Ministerialdirigent, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n3: The applicant alleged, in particular, that the length of his detention had exceeded that permitted by Articles 5 § 3 and 6 § 2 of the Convention. He also complained that his correspondence with his lawyer had been monitored, contrary to Article 8 of the Convention.\n4: The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n5: It was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n6: By a decision of 28 September 2000 the Chamber declared the application admissible.\n7: The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n8: The applicant said that his name was Selahattin Erdem and that he was born in 1958 in Derik (). However, according to the Düsseldorf Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht), his real name was Duran Kalkan and he was born in 1954 in  ().\n9: On 7 April 1988 the applicant, who had enjoyed political refugee status in France since December 1987, was arrested at the German border on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist organisation (Article 129a of the Criminal Code) and of forging documents (Article 267 of the Criminal Code).\n10: On 8 April 1988 the investigating judge at the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) issued a warrant for the applicant's detention pending trial. The applicant remained in custody until 7 March 1994.\n11: On 20 October 1988 the Federal Public Prosecutor started a judicial investigation into the activities of the applicant and fifteen other leaders of the PKK (Workers' Party of Kurdistan).\n12: On 31 August 1989 the Fifth Criminal Division of the Düsseldorf Court of Appeal made an order for the main proceedings, which included five other charges against members of the PKK, to begin.\n13: The proceedings had been brought against eighteen accused and concerned six murders and six abductions, the structure of the terrorist organisation and a further five murders that had been committed within the organisation.\n14: The trial began on 24 October 1989 and ended on 7 March 1994 after 353 days in court.\n15: At the hearing on 7 December 1990 the public prosecutor asked the Court of Appeal to inform the applicant, in accordance with Article 265 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that the charges he was facing could entail a conviction for murder (Article 211 of the Criminal Code) and for his activities as a leader (Rädelsführer) of a terrorist organisation (Article 129a § 2 of the Criminal Code).\n16: By a decision of 8 March 1993, the Court of Appeal ruled that the accused, Mr Kalkan, faced convictions for being a member of a terrorist organisation and for murder, but not for his activities as a leader of that organisation.\n17: Fourteen defendants were no longer involved in the proceedings: two defendants had been discharged in 1990 – one owing to the minor nature of the charges (Geringfügigkeit), the other because of unfitness to stand trial (Verhandlungsunfähigkeit) – while in 1992 ten others had fled the country and two had been convicted of separate offences.\n23: While the applicant was in detention pending trial, his correspondence with his lawyer was monitored under powers contained in Article 148 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ...\n24: In a 900-page judgment of 7 March 1994 the Düsseldorf Court of Appeal convicted the applicant of being a member of a terrorist organisation and sentenced him to six years' imprisonment (Article 129a § 1 of the Criminal Code). It found that he had been one of the founders of the PKK in 1978, had set up units in  and  and had been in charge of recruitment in those countries.\n25: In a judgment of 6 March 1996 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed the applicant's appeal, holding that the judgment of the Court of Appeal did not contain any errors of law that had operated to his detriment.\n26: On 10 April 1996 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht), in which he alleged in particular a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention on the ground that he had not been brought to trial within a reasonable time, and that his correspondence had been monitored unlawfully.\n27: On 19 February 1997 a three-member committee of the  refused to examine the appeal.\n31: Article 148 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down that remand prisoners may communicate in writing and orally with their lawyers.\n32: The first sentence of Article 148 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:\n33: The purpose of the exception set out in Article 148 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to prevent prisoners suspected of an offence under Article 129a of the Criminal Code from continuing to work for the terrorist organisation to which it is alleged they belong and contributing to its survival (Federal Court of Justice, Neue Strafrechtzeitschrift no. 84, p. 177).\n34: Article 148a of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the judge with responsibility for such surveillance measures is the judge of the district court where the prison is located and that he or she shall not have, and may not be assigned, conduct of the investigation and shall keep the information thus obtained confidential, unless it concerns a serious or very serious offence, such as an offence under Article 138 §§ 1 or 2 of the Criminal Code.\n45: It has also been recognised that some measure of control over prisoners' correspondence is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention, regard being paid to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment (see the Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 38, § 98). In assessing the permissible extent of such control in general, the fact that the opportunity to write and to receive letters is sometimes the prisoner's only link with the outside world should, however, not be overlooked.\n46: It is clearly in the general interest that any person who wishes to consult a lawyer should be free to do so under conditions which favour full and uninhibited discussion. It is for this reason that the lawyer-client relationship is, in principle, privileged. Indeed, in its S. v.  judgment of 28 November 1991 the Court stressed the importance of a prisoner's right to communicate with counsel out of earshot of the prison authorities. It was considered, in the context of Article 6 that if a lawyer were unable to confer with his client without such surveillance and receive confidential instructions from him his assistance would lose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective (Series A no. 220, pp. 15-16, § 48; see also, in this context, the Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80, p. 49, §§ 111-113).\n47: In the Court's view, similar considerations apply to a prisoner's correspondence with a lawyer concerning contemplated or pending proceedings where the need for confidentiality is equally pressing ...\n50: The applicant also submitted that the fact that his correspondence with his lawyer was monitored under Article 148 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure infringed Article 8 of the Convention, which provides:\n51: In the Government's submission, the exception to the rule that correspondence between lawyers and their clients is privileged – an exception that was set out in Article 148 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and applied to cases in which the prisoner was suspected of being a member of a terrorist organisation within the meaning of Article 129a of the Criminal Code – was necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Furthermore, that provision contained all the necessary safeguards to avoid abuse (for instance, the judge responsible for opening the correspondence could not have the conduct of the investigation and was required to keep the information confidential).\n52: The applicant contended that the provision was incompatible on principle with Article 8 of the Convention and the presumption of innocence. He pointed out that it had been introduced at the time of the proceedings against members of terrorist groups such as the Red Army Faction (Rote Armee Fraktion), but argued that it could not apply to members of the PKK. In any event, the interference had been disproportionate in view of the nature of the offences with which the applicant was charged. Even if the judge responsible for monitoring the correspondence was under a duty to keep any information obtained confidential, he would need the assistance of a Turkish translator, so there was a risk of leaks or of pressure being exerted, especially in a trial concerning members of the PKK.\n53: It was not disputed that the correspondence between the applicant and his lawyer had been monitored by a judge in accordance with Article 148 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure while the applicant was being detained pending trial (see paragraphs 31-34 above).\n54: There has therefore been an “interference by a public authority” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention with the applicant's right to respect for his correspondence – in this instance with his lawyer – guaranteed by paragraph 1 of Article 8.\n55: Such an interference will contravene Article 8 unless it is “in accordance with the law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 and, furthermore, is “necessary in a democratic society” in order to achieve them (see, among other authorities, Calogero Diana v. Italy, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions  1996-V, p. 1775, § 28).\n56: The Court notes that the basis for the interference was Article 148 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which lays down that the correspondence of prisoners suspected of belonging to a terrorist organisation within the meaning of Article 129a of the Criminal Code with their representatives shall be monitored by a judge who is not involved in the pending proceedings and who is required to keep the information confidential. That provision operates as an exception to the general rule set out in Article 148 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that prisoners are entitled to communicate in writing and orally with their lawyers.\n57: There was therefore a legal basis for the interference in domestic law.\n58: Furthermore, having regard to the wording of the statute concerned, the Court considers that it satisfied the tests of accessibility and foreseeability established in the Court's case-law (see, for a statement of the principles, Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, pp. 32-34, §§ 85-90).\n59: Accordingly, the interference was “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2.\n60: In the Court's view, it is not open to doubt that the monitoring of the applicant's correspondence pursued the legitimate aims of, inter alia, protecting “national security” and/or preventing “disorder or crime” referred to in Article 8 § 2.\n61: The Court reiterates the principles applicable to the monitoring of correspondence between prisoners and their lawyers which it laid down in particular in Campbell v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 233, pp. 18-19, §§ 44-48):\n62: The Court notes that in the instant case Article 148 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure operates in a very specific field, namely the prevention of terrorism, its purpose, according to the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, being to prevent prisoners suspected of offences under Article 129a of the Criminal Code from continuing to work for the terrorist organisation to which it is alleged they belong and contributing to its survival (see paragraph 33 above).\n63: This exception to the general rule that correspondence between prisoners and their representatives is privileged was adopted in  in the 1970s in the wake of a series of bloody terrorist attacks by the Red Army Faction that had a traumatic effect on German society.\n64: In Klass and Others v. Germany (judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 23, § 48), which concerned a statute permitting restrictions on the confidentiality of mail, post and telecommunications, the Court stated that the following principles applied in prevention of terrorism cases:\n65: Nonetheless, the privilege that attaches to correspondence between prisoners and their lawyers constitutes a fundamental right of the individual and directly affects the rights of the defence. For that reason, as the Court has stated above, that rule may only be derogated from in exceptional cases and on condition that adequate and sufficient safeguards against abuse are in place (see, mutatis mutandis, Klass and Others, cited above, ibid.).\n66: The trial of senior PKK figures took place in the special context of the prevention of terrorism in all its forms. Furthermore, it does not appear unreasonable for the German authorities to have sought to ensure maximal security during the trial, bearing in mind that a large Turkish community, many of whose members are of Kurdish origin, lives in .\n67: The Court further notes that the provision is worded very precisely, as it specifies the category of persons whose correspondence must be monitored, that is to say prisoners suspected of belonging to a terrorist organisation within the meaning of Article 129a of the Criminal Code. Moreover, there are restrictions on the use of the measure, which operates as an exception to the general rule that privilege attaches to correspondence between prisoners and their lawyers, which act as safeguards: unlike other cases that have come before the Court and in which correspondence was opened by the prison authorities (see in particular Campbell, cited above, and Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80), in the instant case the power to monitor correspondence was vested in an independent judge who had to be unconnected with the investigation and was under a duty to keep the information thus obtained confidential. Lastly, the power to monitor correspondence is limited, since prisoners are free to discuss their cases orally with their representatives. While it is true that representatives are precluded from delivering written documents or other objects to prisoners, they may provide them with information contained in written documents.\n68: The Court reiterates that some compromise between the requirements for defending democratic society and individual rights is inherent in the system of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Klass and Others, cited above, pp. 27-28, § 59).\n69: Having regard to the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms (see Bader, Meins, Meinhof, Grundmann v. Germany, no. 6166/73, Commission decision of 30 May 1975, Decisions and Reports 2), the safeguards attached to the monitoring of correspondence in the instant case and the margin of appreciation afforded to the State, the Court holds that the interference in issue was not disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued.\n70: Consequently, there has been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention."

He pointed out that many of the items of correspondence with his solicitor concerned legal actions or complaints against prison officials who had an interest in protecting their positions.

Such access was susceptible to abuse in view of the solidarity which existed amongst prison staff.",
            "001-57771\n33: The Court cannot accept these arguments. It notes in the first place that from the outset in his application to the Commission of 14 January 1986 the applicant complained that \"his correspondence with his solicitors and the European Commission of Human Rights has regularly been subjected to interference in so far as it has been opened, perused, scrutinised and censored by the prison authorities\". He added that he was restricted in his contacts with his solicitor and the Commission because he knew that \"this correspondence will be read (...) and noted by the prison authorities\". The Court further observes that the Government did not dispute that the applicant’s incoming and outgoing correspondence with his solicitor, other than that concerning a petition to the Commission, could be examined under the Prison Rules. Indeed, the SHHD had informed the applicant and his solicitor that this correspondence was subject to the existing rules which provided for the opening and reading of such letters (see paragraphs 13-14 above). In these circumstances, the applicant can claim to be a victim of an interference with his right to respect for correspondence under Article 8 (art. 8).",

By way of analogy they pointed out that Article 3 para. 2 (c) of the European Agreement only guaranteed, in the context of proceedings before the Strasbourg organs, the confidentiality of legal consultations with a prisoner during a visit. In a commentary to the Agreement, the Committee of Experts on Human Rights considered that correspondence between a prisoner and his lawyer, in this context, was susceptible to examination by the competent authorities (report to the Committee of Ministers, 27 October 1969, para. 58, H (69)15.)",

There was no reason to treat a printed e-mail differently from a letter. In fact, the former was safer as nothing extra could be passed to a detainee.

She argued that the process of invalidation had lacked transparency and sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness, and that the decisions of the electoral commissions and domestic courts lacked any factual basis and were contrary to a number of requirements of the domestic electoral law.\n\n001-158149\n143: The Court must ensure that the decision-making process on ineligibility or contestation of election results is accompanied by criteria framed to prevent arbitrary decisions. In particular, such a finding must be reached by a body which can provide a minimum of guarantees of its impartiality. Similarly, the discretion enjoyed by the body concerned must not be exorbitantly wide; it must be circumscribed, with sufficient precision, by the provisions of domestic law. Lastly, the procedure for declaring a candidate ineligible must be such as to ensure a fair and objective decision and prevent any abuse of power on the part of the relevant authority (see Podkolzina, cited above, § 35; Kovach v. Ukraine, no. 39424/02, §§ 54-55, ECHR 2008; and Kerimova, cited above, §§ 44-45). The Court also reiterates that under the subsidiarity principle it is not its task to replace the domestic courts in assessing the facts or interpreting domestic law. In the specific context of electoral disputes, it is not called up to determine whether the irregularities in the voting procedure complained of by the parties amounted to violations of the relevant domestic legislation (see Namat Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 18705/06, § 77, 8 April 2010). Its role in determining whether there was an unjustified interference in “the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” is confined to establishing whether the decision given by the domestic court was arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see Babenko v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 43476/98, 4 May 1999; Partija “Jaunie Demokrati” and Partija “Musu Zeme” v.

Latvia (no. 46726/99, ECHR 2002-II), the Court reiterated that the right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime, would only be illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment. Consequently, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires the finding that this or that candidate has failed to satisfy them to comply with a number of criteria framed to prevent arbitrary decisions. In particular, such a finding must be reached by a body which can provide a minimum of guarantees of its impartiality. Similarly, the discretion enjoyed by the body concerned must not be exorbitantly wide; it must be circumscribed, with sufficient precision, by the provisions of domestic law.

LATVIA; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 46726/99) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Latvian national, Mrs Ingrīda Podkolzina (“the applicant”), on 25 February 1999.\n2: The applicant was initially represented by Mrs I. Oziša, the assistant of a member of the Latvian parliament. In a letter of 2 May 2001 the applicant informed the Court that she would thenceforth be represented by Mr W. Bowring, barrister, of Colchester (). The Latvian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms K. Maļinovska.\n3: The applicant alleged that the removal of her name from the list of candidates at the general election for insufficient knowledge of Latvian, the official language in , constituted a breach of the right to stand as a candidate in an election, guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. She further complained of violations of Articles 13 (in substance) and 14 of the Convention.\n4: The application was allocated to the second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. Mr E. Levits, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr R. Maruste, the judge elected in respect of , to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\n5: By a decision of 8 February 2001 the Chamber declared the application admissible [Note by the Registry. The Court's decision is obtainable from the Registry].\n6: The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine), the Government, but not the applicant, filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). On 2 May 2001 the applicant submitted her claim for just satisfaction (Article 41 of the Convention). On 4 June 2001 the Government submitted their observations on the claim.\n7: On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n8: The applicant, a Latvian national born in 1964 and living in  (), is a member of the Russian-speaking minority in .\n9: By a decision of 30 July 1998 the Central Electoral Commission (Centrālā vēlēšanu komisija) registered the list of the candidates of the National Harmony Party (Tautas saskaņas partija) in the elections to the Latvian parliament (Saeima) of 3 October 1998. The applicant's name appeared on the list as the candidate for the constituency of Latgale.\n10: On 6 August 1998 an examiner employed by the State Language Inspectorate (Valsts valodas inspekcija), part of the State Language Centre, went to the applicant's place of work and examined her orally to assess her knowledge of Latvian. As the applicant had not been notified of the visit, the examiner approached her while she was conducting negotiations with her business associates.\n11: The examiner then drew up a report to the effect that the applicant did not have an adequate command of the official language at the “third level”, the highest of the three categories of competence defined in Latvian regulations.\n12: On 10 August 1998 the State Language Centre sent the chairman of the Central Electoral Commission a letter certifying the level of knowledge of the official language attained by a number of candidates on the lists registered for the parliamentary elections. Although the letter referred to the report drawn up by the examiner from the State Language Inspectorate, the report was not appended to it. According to the certificate, of the nine candidates actually examined only the applicant did not have a command of Latvian at the “third level”. Twelve other candidates, who had not been required to take an examination, had documents certifying that their knowledge was at the requisite level.\n13: By a decision of 21 August 1998 the Central Electoral Commission struck the applicant's name out of the list of candidates.\n14: On 27 August 1998 the National Harmony Party, acting on the applicant's behalf, asked the  to set aside the above decision. In its pleading the party alleged that when the list of candidates in the election was registered a copy of the certificate attesting to the applicant's knowledge of the State language had been supplied to the Central Electoral Commission. It submitted that the Central Electoral Commission should have taken that certificate into account, instead of relying solely on the certificate issued by the State Language Centre, as the two documents contradicted each other.\n15: In a final judgment of 31 August 1998 the  refused the application on the ground that the Central Electoral Commission had acted within the limits laid down by the Parliamentary Elections Act. In its judgment the  noted that section 11 of the Act made possession of a certificate of knowledge of the official language at the “third level” by all candidates who had not completed their primary or secondary education in Latvian a prerequisite for the registration of a list of candidates. Consequently, the Central Electoral Commission had complied with the requirements of the Act by deciding to register the list on which the applicant's name appeared. On the other hand, section 13 of the Act empowered the Commission to rectify the lists already registered by striking out the names of candidates whose level of knowledge of the official language had proved to be insufficient; in the applicant's case the inadequacy of her linguistic competence had been confirmed by the State Language Centre's certificate. The  accordingly held that there had been no breach of the law.\n16: On 14 September 1998 the National Harmony Party, acting on the applicant's behalf, lodged third-party appeals against that judgment with the President of the Civil Division of the Supreme Court and the Attorney-General, asking for the proceedings to be reopened on account of a serious and manifest breach of the substantive legal rules, resulting from faulty interpretation of the Parliamentary Elections Act.\n17: Article 9 of the Constitution (Satversme) of the , adopted in 1922, provides:\n18: The relevant provisions of the Law of 25 May 1995 on parliamentary elections (Saeimas vēlēšanu likums – “the Parliamentary Elections Act”) are worded as follows:\n19: By section 50 of the Law of 28 July 1994 on the rules of parliamentary procedure (Saeimas kārtības rullis – “the Rules of Parliamentary Procedure Act”), Latvian is the sole working language in Parliament and its committees. All draft legislation and decisions, challenges and questions by members, and any documents appended to them must be written in Latvian.\n20: The relevant provisions of the Languages Act (Latvijas Republikas Valodu likums), in force at the material time and up to 1 September 2000, were worded as follows:\n21: At the material time the precise levels of knowledge of Latvian were laid down by the regulation of 25 May 1992 on certification of knowledge of the State language (Valsts valodas prasmes atestācijas nolikums). Chapter II of the regulation fixed the limits of the three levels of knowledge of Latvian, of which the third was defined as follows:\n22: Chapter IV of the regulation provided that examinations to test linguistic competence were to be organised by certification boards of nine, seven or five members, as the case required. Thus a board to verify the linguistic competence of a firm's employees had to have at least five members, including one representative of the trade concerned, one member delegated by the municipal certification board, and specialists in Latvian.\n23: Section 51 of the Parliamentary Elections Act (see paragraph 18 above) provides:\n24: Administrative appeals are governed by the provisions of Chapter 24-A of the Latvian Code of Civil Procedure (Latvijas Civilprocesa kodekss), applicable to all relations covered by administrative law, except those for which a special appeals procedure has been laid down by law. In respect of electoral matters the lex specialis is Chapter 23 of the Code, whose relevant provisions provide as follows:\n25: The applicant complained that the removal of her name from the list of candidates for insufficient knowledge of Latvian had infringed her right to stand as a candidate in the parliamentary election, guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which provides:\n26: Referring in the first place to the general principles laid down in the established case-law of the Convention institutions regarding the nature and scope of the guarantees of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Government observed that the rights it guaranteed were not absolute, that there was room for “implied limitations”, and that Contracting States had a wide margin of appreciation regarding the conditions governing the right to stand for election. However, these conditions should not curtail electoral rights to such an extent as to impair their very essence; they should be imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and the means employed should not be disproportionate.\n27: The Government pointed out that the linguistic requirements complained of did not exist before 1995 and that as a result, at the first parliamentary elections after the State recovered its independence, in 1993, a number of persons who neither spoke nor understood Latvian had become MPs. As the persons concerned had been incapable of following the debates in Parliament and its committees, its work had been seriously hampered. That was why, in enacting the new electoral legislation, Parliament had decided to require candidates to prove that they had a command of the official language, in order to avoid similar practical difficulties in future. The provision complained of therefore pursued legitimate aims, namely meeting the need for electors to communicate with their elected representatives and for MPs to carry on normally the work that voters had entrusted to them.\n28: The Government further submitted that the requirement of a command of the official language at the upper level did not impair the very essence of the right to stand as a candidate since anyone who wished to do so but did not have a sufficient command of Latvian could always reach the level required by improving his knowledge of the language. In that respect, the requirement was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n29: As regards the allegedly arbitrary nature of the examination in Latvian imposed on the applicant, the Government observed that the test was designed to determine the current level of a candidate's knowledge of the language. Accordingly, while the applicant might have had a command of Latvian at the “third level” when she received the certificate attesting to her knowledge of the State language, in January 1997, her linguistic competence could have deteriorated during the eighteen months that had elapsed before the examination in issue.\n30: The applicant contested the Government's arguments. She pointed out in the first place that Latvian was not the mother tongue of the members of the Russian-speaking minority, which accounted for almost 40% of the population of  and to which she belonged. She therefore could not see how her insufficient knowledge of Latvian could prevent her from carrying out the tasks entrusted to her by her Russian-speaking constituents or from communicating with them. In that connection, and even supposing that her knowledge of Latvian did not correspond to the “third level”, it was in any event sufficient to enable her to carry out her parliamentary duties normally. She therefore considered that the removal of her name from the list of candidates had been manifestly disproportionate to any legitimate aim the requirement complained of might have pursued.\n31: In addition, the applicant criticised the verification of her knowledge of Latvian carried out by the State Language Inspectorate, purportedly under section 13(3) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, contesting in particular the need for such verification, since the validity and authenticity of her permanent certificate of knowledge of the State language had not been disputed by any national authority. Moreover, comparing that verification with the ordinary procedure for certification of linguistic competence, which she had been required to comply with in 1997 in order to obtain her certificate, she pointed out that an examination for the purpose of certifying linguistic competence was conducted by a board with at least five members, whereas the verification in issue had been carried out by a single examiner. Furthermore, the ordinary certification procedure was laid down in a regulation containing the assessment criteria, which the applicant considered objective and reasonable. On the other hand, when carrying out the verification in issue, the examiner had not been required to observe those criteria and had a completely free hand in assessing the applicant's level. In particular, language and spelling mistakes were inevitable in view of the applicant's extreme nervousness, caused by the examiner's conduct. The applicant accordingly submitted that the verification of the level of her command of Latvian which had led to the removal of her name from the list of candidates had been carried out in a manifestly arbitrary way.\n32: The applicant further criticised the fact that of the twenty-one candidates in possession of a certificate attesting to knowledge of Latvian at the “third level” only nine, including herself, had had to undergo this check, whereas the certificates of the other twelve candidates had been adjudged sufficient to establish their level of command of the language. As there was no basis in domestic law for that distinction, the applicant submitted that it confirmed the existence of an arbitrary attitude towards her.\n33: The Court reiterates that the subjective rights to vote and to stand for election are implicit in Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. Although those rights are important, they are not absolute. Since Article 3 recognises them without setting them forth in express terms, let alone defining them, there is room for “implied limitations”. In their internal legal orders the Contracting States make the rights to vote and to stand for election subject to conditions which are not in principle precluded under Article 3. They have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, but it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 113, p. 23, § 52; Gitonas and Others v. Greece, judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, pp. 1233-34, § 39; Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2384, § 75; and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 201, ECHR 2000IV).\n34: In the present case the Court notes that the applicant was struck out of the list of candidates in accordance with section 5, point 7, of the Parliamentary Elections Act, which makes ineligible persons who do not have a command of Latvian at the “upper” level. In the Government's submission, the obligation for a candidate to understand and speak Latvian is warranted by the need to ensure the proper functioning of Parliament, in which Latvian is the sole working language. They emphasised in particular that the aim of this requirement was to enable MPs to take an active part in the work of the House and effectively defend their electors' interests.\n35: That being so, it must determine whether the decision to remove the applicant's name from the list of candidates was proportionate to the aim pursued. In that connection, the Court reiterates that the object and purpose of the Convention, which is an instrument for the protection of human beings, requires its provisions to be interpreted and applied in such a way as to make their stipulations not theoretical or illusory but practical and effective (see, for example, Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15-16, § 33; United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports 1998-I, pp. 18-19, § 33; and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 100, ECHR 1999-III). The right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime, would only be illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment. Consequently, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires the finding that this or that candidate has failed to satisfy them to comply with a number of criteria framed to prevent arbitrary decisions. In particular, such a finding must be reached by a body which can provide a minimum of guarantees of its impartiality. Similarly, the discretion enjoyed by the body concerned  must not be exorbitantly wide; it must be circumscribed, with sufficient precision, by the provisions of domestic law. Lastly, the procedure for ruling a candidate ineligible must be such as to guarantee a fair and objective decision and prevent any abuse of power on the part of the relevant authority.\n36: In the present case, the Court notes that the decision to strike the applicant out of the list of candidates was not grounded on the fact that she had no valid certificate of linguistic competence, as required by section 11, point 5, of the Parliamentary Elections Act. On the contrary, at the time when the list was registered she was in possession of such a certificate, which attested to the fact that her knowledge of Latvian had reached the upper level as defined in the Latvian regulations. The Court emphasises that the validity of the applicant's certificate was never questioned by the Latvian authorities. It further notes that it was issued to the applicant after an examination organised by a board composed, pursuant to the regulation of 25 May 1992 on certification of knowledge of the State language, of five examiners. Her command of Latvian was determined by means of deliberations followed by a vote and in accordance with objective assessment criteria laid down by the regulation (see paragraph 22 above).\n37: The Court considers that the above conclusion is confirmed by the way the  examined the applicant's appeal. The sole basis for its judgment of 31 August 1998 was the certificate drawn up by the State Language Centre after the examination in issue; it did not rule on the other evidence in the file. The Court therefore considers that in admitting as irrebuttable evidence the results of an examination the procedure for which lacked the fundamental guarantees of fairness, the  deliberately avoided providing a remedy for the violation committed.\n38: Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the Court concludes that the decision to strike the applicant out of the list of candidates cannot be regarded as proportionate to any legitimate aim pleaded by the Government. It follows that in this case there has been a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n39: The applicant further complained that in denying her the right to stand as a candidate in the parliamentary elections for the sole reason that she did not have a command of Latvian at the highest level defined by the domestic regulations the Latvian authorities had caused her to suffer discrimination prohibited by Article 14 of the Convention in the exercise of her right under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. The relevant parts of Article 14 provide:\n40: The Government observed that, according to the judgment of 23 July 1968 in the Case “relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium” (merits) (Series A no. 6), the equality of treatment enshrined in Article 14 of the Convention is violated only where a distinction has no objective and reasonable justification (loc. cit., pp. 34-35, § 10). In the light of their arguments concerning the alleged violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 taken separately, the Government submitted that the distinction criticised had been based on such a justification. They pointed out in particular that the applicant was not the only candidate on her list who was required to undergo a verification of her linguistic competence. There had accordingly been no violation of Article 14.\n41: The applicant rejected that argument. In her submission, the way in which such a verification was carried out and the almost total freedom enjoyed by the examiner made it easy to strike out of the list any person whose mother tongue was not Latvian. As a result, a truly discriminatory practice vis-à-vis members of national minorities was to be feared. The applicant further observed that of the twenty-one candidates who had not been educated in Latvian only nine, including her, had been required to take the above-mentioned test. In that connection, she presumed the existence of covert discrimination.\n42: The Court considers that this complaint is essentially the same as the complaint under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. Regard being had to the conclusion it reached in that connection (see paragraph 38 above), the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention separately.\n43: Relying in substance on Article 13 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the applicant complained that in confining itself to endorsing the finding set out in a certificate issued by an administrative authority, without verifying the truth of the matter and without ruling on the other evidence before it, the Riga Regional Court had infringed her right to an effective remedy before a national authority. Article 13 provides:\n44: The Government contended that the State Language Centre was the only authority empowered to determine the level of a candidate's knowledge of the State language. They submitted that the applicant had been able to exercise without hindrance her right to a remedy by means of an appeal to the . At the hearing on 31 August 1998 that court had made a detailed assessment of the evidence before it before holding that the measure complained of had complied with the Parliamentary Elections Act. As the  had looked into the merits of the applicant's complaints, there was no reason to consider that the remedy afforded in Latvian law was not an effective one for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention.\n45: As with Article 14, the Court considers that the conclusions it reached regarding the alleged violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 taken separately (see paragraphs 37-38 above) absolve it from the obligation to consider the case from the standpoint of Article 13 of the Convention also.\n46: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n47: The applicant submitted that the removal of her name from the list of candidates had had detrimental consequences for her economic situation. In that connection, she maintained that the negative publicity about her after she was struck out had plunged her into a state of distress and frustration which prevented her from carrying on her commercial activities normally and caused potential business associates to avoid her. In addition, the certificate in which the State Language Centre had asserted that she did not have a command of Latvian at the upper level in fact meant that she was thenceforth unfit for the post of managing director, and this had led her to resign from her job. Since then, with the exception of half-time work here and there in a small private business, she had not managed to find appropriate employment. The applicant therefore asked the Court to award her 1,500 lati (LVL) for the loss she had sustained and for loss of earnings.\n48: The Government submitted that there was no connection between the alleged violation and the amount claimed by the applicant. They observed in particular that she had decided to resign from her post in the company of her own free will. Even if she feared that the unfavourable report of the State Language Centre might cause her prejudice in her professional life, she could always have asked for her linguistic competence to be re-examined, but had not done so.\n49: The Court considers, like the Government, that no causal link has been established between the alleged pecuniary loss and the violation found (see Van Geyseghem v. Belgium [GC], no. 26103/95, § 40, ECHR 1999-I, and Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, § 73, ECHR 1999-II). It accordingly dismisses the applicant's claims under this head.\n50: The applicant claimed LVL 50,000 (approximately 89,000 euros (EUR)) in compensation for the distress and humiliation she had suffered through being struck out of the list of candidates. In the light of the criteria laid down by the Court on the question of redress for non-pecuniary damage, she submitted that her case concerned a serious violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Convention, and that the amount claimed was justified by the suffering she had endured as a result of the violation.\n51: The Government considered the sum claimed by the applicant exorbitant, regard being had in particular to the cost of living and the level of income in  at present. They submitted that the finding of a violation would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage the applicant might have suffered.\n52: The Court reiterates that non-pecuniary damage is to be assessed with reference to the autonomous criteria it has derived from the Convention, not on the basis of the principles defined in the law or practice of the State concerned (see, mutatis mutandis, The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) (Article 50), judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 38, p. 17, § 41, and Probstmeier v. Germany, judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, p. 1140, § 77). In the present case the Court cannot deny that the applicant suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of being prevented from standing as a candidate in the general election. Consequently, ruling on an equitable basis and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it awards her EUR 7,500 for non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into lati at the rate applicable on the date of adoption of the present judgment.\n53: The applicant claimed LVL 1,750 (approximately EUR 3,150) as reimbursement for the costs and expenses she had incurred for the preparation of her case and its presentation to the Court. That sum was broken down as follows:\n54: The Government left this matter to the Court's discretion.\n55: The Court reiterates that, in order for costs to be included in an award under Article 41 of the Convention, it must be established that they were actually and necessarily incurred and reasonable as to quantum (see, among many other authorities, Nikolova, cited above, § 79, and Jėčius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, § 112, ECHR 2000-IX). In the present case it notes some confusion about the documents submitted as evidence that the applicant received legal assistance both in Latvia and abroad, since there is no document in the file which shows that the association Latvijas Cilvēktiesību komiteja participated as such in the proceedings before the Court. However, it appears from the wording of the bill produced by the applicant that she was represented by Mrs I. Oziša, who works within that association. As regards Mr W. Bowring, the Court was not informed of his participation in the proceedings until 2 May 2001, that is after the application had been declared admissible, although the authority to act signed by the applicant and sent to the Court on the same date bears a much earlier date – 15 October 2000.\n56: According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in  at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 6% per annum."

                "CASE OF KOVACH v. UKRAINE; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 39424/02) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Mykola Mykolayovych Kovach (“the applicant”), on 17 October 2002.\n2: The applicant was represented by Ms N. Petrova, a lawyer practising in Kyiv. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.\n3: On 14 February 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n4: The applicant stood as a candidate in the parliamentary elections of 31 March 2002 in the single-seat electoral constituency no. 72 in the Zakarpattya (Transcarpathia) region (Одномандатний виборчий округ № 72).\n5: Among the candidates registered in that constituency was Mr G., who, at the material time, occupied the post of Head of the Beregovo District State Administration (Zakarpattya Oblast) (Берегівська державна адміністрація Закарпатської області).\n6: On 13 and 28 March 2002 the local Hungarian-language newspapers Bereginfo and Karpati Igaz Szo published the following appeal to voters:\n7: The appeal was followed by a large number of signatures, including those of Mrs D., secretary of the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 (Окружна виборча комісія), and Mr O., the Chairman of the same electoral commission.\n8: On 31 March 2002 the parliamentary elections were held. During the elections an observer, acting on behalf of Mr G. in electoral division no. 14 of constituency no. 72, drew up a report (акт) stating that she had witnessed an unknown person depositing several (she believed there were seven) ballots in the ballot box. The report was signed by two voters. The observers sent by Mr G. to electoral divisions nos. 45 and 58 drew up similar reports of such breaches of electoral law, stating that they had seen respectively five and ten ballots being cast in the ballot box unlawfully.\n9: According to the first results generated by the computerised system, the applicant had obtained 33,567 votes, compared with 33,524 for his main opponent, Mr G. In electoral division no. 14 the applicant had obtained 537 and Mr G. 291 votes out of 1,570 votes cast. In division no. 45, out of 1,244 voters 711 had voted for the applicant and 372 for his opponent. In division no. 58 there had been 830 votes, of which 475 had been cast for the applicant and 219 for Mr G. In division no. 67, of 1,480 voters 765 cast their ballots for the applicant and 387 for his opponent. In total, in the four above-mentioned electoral divisions the applicant had obtained 2,488 votes, against 1,269 for Mr G.\n10: By decision no. 36 of 2 April 2002, the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72, on the basis of the above-mentioned observers’ reports, declared the results in electoral divisions nos. 14, 45 and 58 invalid on the grounds of serious breaches of electoral law. It was also established that on the night of 1 April 2002, after the close of polls and the count, the members of the Electoral Commission of division no. 67 had unlawfully opened the sealed polling station and retrieved the original voting records and several invalid ballots. The next day the Chairman of that division’s Electoral Commission had brought those voting records and ballots to the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72. No reason had been given for these actions. Therefore, the results of the elections in division no. 67 were also declared invalid. On the same date the applicant appealed against this decision to the Central Electoral Commission (Центральна виборча комісія – “the CEC”).\n11: By decision no. 37, the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 announced the final results of the ballot, according to which the applicant had obtained 31,079 votes compared with 32,255 for Mr G. This result corresponded to that set out in the first voting record, referred to above, after deduction of the votes in divisions nos. 14, 45, 58 and 67. Mr G., therefore, was declared elected as a member of parliament for the constituency.\n12: On 3 April 2002 the chairmen and members of the Electoral Commissions of divisions nos. 14, 45, 58 and 67 sent statements to the Chairman of the CEC to the effect that none of the official observers had drawn their attention to any breach of electoral law during the voting or the count, and that the documents submitted by the observers complaining of irregularities had been drawn up after the count, “the results of which did not suit one of the candidates”.\n13: By decision no. 750 of 5 April 2002, the CEC, following the applicant’s complaint of 2 April 2002, set aside decision no. 36 and instructed the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 to give a reasoned decision on the results of the vote in the four divisions in question. Referring to the first paragraph of section 70 of the Parliamentary Elections Act, the CEC observed that the impugned decision had not been duly reasoned and that there was no conclusive evidence of the alleged irregularities or the allegation that the number of ballots deposited unlawfully had exceeded 10% of the votes cast in each electoral division.\n14: At a meeting of 6 April 2002, the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72, by a majority of nine votes to two with three abstaining, adopted decisions nos. 40 and 41, whereby the vote in electoral divisions nos. 14, 45, 58 and 67 was declared invalid for the same reasons as before. In these decisions the Commission noted that the twelfth paragraph of section 72 of the Parliamentary Elections Act allowed a vote to be declared invalid on account of “other circumstances making it impossible to establish the results of the expression of the electorate’s wishes”, in addition to those enumerated in section 70 of the Act. The Commission further noted that since section 72 did not list these “other circumstances”, the matter fell within its exclusive competence. Lastly, the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 concluded that the irregularities which it had established and those noted by the observers could be considered as “other circumstances”, making it impossible to establish the electorate’s wishes.\n15: On 9 April 2002 the applicant lodged a complaint challenging decisions nos. 40 and 41 of 6 April 2002. He submitted that the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 had not followed the instructions given by the CEC in its decision of 5 April 2002 concerning the need to give sufficient reasons.\n16: By decision no. 858 of 12 April 2002, the CEC rejected the applicant’s complaint of 9 April 2002 on the ground that, in accordance with section 72 of the Parliamentary Elections Act, the task of establishing the existence of “other circumstances” causing the vote to be declared invalid fell to the constituency electoral commission.\n17: The applicant appealed against this decision to the Supreme Court, which, in a judgment of 24 April 2002, upheld the findings of the CEC, including that concerning the exclusive competence of the constituency Electoral Commissions to establish the “other circumstances” provided for in section 72 of the 2001 Parliamentary Elections Act.\n18: On 3 April 2002 Mr V., the applicant’s observer, in the presence of the observers of other candidates and the Chairman and two members of the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72, drew up a report alleging a breach of electoral law. According to the authors, the conditions in the office of the electoral commission located in the basement of the State Administration building in Beregovo were not adequate to ensure that the ballots were kept secure and intact; in particular, they alleged that the doors and filing cabinets had not been sealed, and that one of the doors did not even have a lock on it.\n19: On 5 April 2002 the applicant lodged a complaint with the CEC, challenging decision no. 37 of 2 April 2002 whereby Mr G. had been announced the winner of the elections in constituency no. 72\n20: On 7 April 2002, after the CEC’s decision no. 750 (see paragraph 13 above), a recount of the votes in the electoral divisions nos. 14, 45, 58 and 67 was held. After the recount, the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 issued a detailed voting record dated 7 April 2002 setting out the results of the ballot in the constituency, which were the same as those stated in its decision no. 37.\n21: On the same day a member of the constituency Electoral Commission, together with two observers of two of the unsuccessful candidates, prepared a memorandum, addressed to the CEC, alleging that the packages containing the ballot papers had not been sealed by the Electoral Commission of division no. 67, that some of the ballot papers had been damaged and that, in view of these factors, access to the ballots by third parties before the recount could not be ruled out.\n22: On 14 April 2002 the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 drew up the corrected voting record (see paragraph 27 below) setting out the results of the vote.\n23: On the same date the deputy chairman and three members of the Electoral Commission of division no. 67 drew up a memorandum, addressed to the CEC, in which they stated that, in breach of the law, the deputy chairman and secretary of the constituency Electoral Commission, accompanied by four officials of the municipal council and the State Administration acting as observers appointed by Mr G., had come to their homes asking them to sign the corrected voting record. The signatories of the document expressed doubts as to the accuracy of the figures given in the record of 14 April 2002.\n24: On 15 April 2002 the corrected voting records were sent to the CEC.\n25: On 16 April 2002 the applicant lodged a complaint with the CEC seeking to have the record of 14 April 2002 declared invalid. Referring to the appeal to voters published on 13 and 28 March 2002 in the newspapers Bereginfo and Karpati Igaz Szo, he criticised the fact that the chairman and the secretary of the commission had engaged in election campaigning for his opponent. He also noted that the conditions in which the ballot materials had been kept and the new voting record produced cast doubt on the accuracy of the results of the vote obtained after the recount on 7 April 2002.\n26: In a letter of 18 April 2002, the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 informed the CEC that, in accordance with the instructions of the Zakarpattya Oblast Police Department (ГУ МВС України в Закарпатський області), the commission’s office had been properly protected and that no illegal entry had been found to have occurred.\n27: By a decision of 18 April 2002, the CEC examined and rejected the applicant’s complaints of 5 and 16 April 2002. It noted that the voting record drawn up after the recount of 7 April 2002 did not contain certain data, namely the number of invalid ballots, and that the amended record of 14 April 2002 had corrected that error. The CEC further noted that decision no. 37 of 2 April 2002 had been lawful and valid given that, according to the corrected voting record, Mr G. had obtained the highest number of votes. Moreover, no indication was found that the way in which the recount had been organised had affected the accuracy of the results of the vote. The CEC referred in this regard to the letter of 18 April 2002 of the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 concerning the security of its office. Lastly, the CEC found that the applicant had failed to indicate any ground provided by the Parliamentary Elections Act for the dismissal of the Chairman and the secretary of the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72.\n28: The applicant challenged this decision before the Supreme Court, which, in a judgment given on 22 April 2002, rejected his complaint. It held that the decision of 18 April 2002 had been taken within the CEC’s competence and in a manner prescribed by the applicable domestic law.\n29: The relevant Article of the Constitution provides:\n30: At the material time the Ukrainian electoral system was governed by section 1 of this Act. It was based on a mixed-member proportional system, where 225 of the 450 members of the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian unicameral parliament) were elected from the single-seat constituencies by simple plurality (“first past the post”) (see Sukhovetskyy v. , no. 13716/02, ECHR 2006VI) and another 225 seats were reserved for candidates from party lists (see Melnychenko v. Ukraine, no. 17707/02, ECHR 2004X).\n31: In accordance with section 18 of the Act, the system of electoral commissions included the CEC, commissions of electoral constituencies and electoral divisions. Each electoral constituency consisted of several divisions.\n32: Section 29 of the Act provided that the candidates for election were entitled to challenge the decisions, actions and omissions of the electoral commissions before the higher electoral commissions or the courts. The higher electoral commission, following such an application, the decision of the court or of its own motion, could set aside the decision of the lower commission and either take a new decision or oblige the commission concerned to reconsider the matter. Decisions, actions and omissions of the CEC could be challenged before the Supreme Court.\n33: Section 70 of the Act determined the procedure for having the vote in an electoral division declared invalid by the electoral commission of that division.\n34: Section 72 of the Act regulated the procedure for examination by the constituency commissions of voting records issued by the division commissions.\n35: The 2004 Parliamentary Elections Act (as amended on 7 July 2005) provides for proportional representation in elections. Section 90 of the 2004 Act retains the power for commissions of electoral divisions to declare a ballot inadmissible if the number of fraudulent votes exceeds 10% of the total votes cast. Section 92 provides that, after a recount, commissions of electoral constituencies are entitled to annul the vote in an electoral division if the circumstances set out in section 90 have been established, or if intentional acts have wrongfully interfered with the work of the members of the electoral commissions or the candidates’ observers.\n36: The Court observes that after communication of the application to the respondent Government and in response to the Government’s objections as to the admissibility and merits of the application, the applicant submitted further complaints, alleging that during the election campaign the applicant and his supporters had been constantly oppressed by the authorities. The applicant also complained that his main opponent, Mr G., had used his post of Head of the Beregovo District State Administration to influence the campaign and the outcome of the elections.\n37: The Government made no comments.\n38: In the Court’s view, the new complaints are related in a general sense to the present case, but do not constitute an elaboration of the applicant’s original complaint to the Court, which is limited to the alleged unfairness of the count procedure at constituency no. 72 during the 2002 parliamentary elections. The Court considers, therefore, that it is not appropriate now to take these matters up separately in the context of the present application (see, inter alia, Piryanik v. Ukraine, no. 75788/01, § 20, 19 April 2005, and Lyashko v. Ukraine, no. 21040/02, § 29, 10 August 2006).\n39: The applicant complained that the conditions in which the elections had been conducted in constituency no. 72 had not ensured the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature. In particular, he complained about the invalidation of the votes cast in electoral divisions nos. 14, 45, 58 and 67, and the alleged unfairness of the subsequent recount. He also complained that the chairman and secretary of the constituency had made an appeal to voters in a local newspaper, thereby indicating their lack of impartiality. He relied on Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which provides:\n40: The Government argued that the applicant had generally failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. Although the Convention and its Protocols constituted a part of the law of , the applicant never raised either before the CEC or the Supreme Court any complaints of a violation of the Convention provisions.\n41: The applicant disagreed.\n42: The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies normally requires that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at the international level should have been aired before the domestic courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see Azinas v. Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, § 38, ECHR 2004III). It is undisputed that the applicant raised his complaints about the invalidation of the vote cast in electoral divisions nos. 14, 45, 58 and 67 and the alleged unfairness of the recount of 7 April 2002 before the CEC and, subsequently, before the Supreme Court. Those issues were therefore fully before the national authorities. The Government have not suggested that any domestic rules required reference to the Convention, nor have they claimed that additional reference to Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 would have affected the examination or outcome of the case before the CEC or the Supreme Court. The Court therefore finds that the applicant adequately raised these complaints before the domestic authorities, and rejects the objection.\n43: The Court finds that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that these complaints are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.\n44: As to the applicant’s complaint about the publication in a local newspaper of the appeal to voters signed by the Chairman and the secretary of the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72, the Government claimed that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies in that he had failed to raise this complaint before the CEC and the Supreme Court. The applicant submitted that this issue had been addressed in his application to the CEC of 16 April 2002. If the application concerned solely this issue, the Court has doubts as to whether an application to the CEC without a subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court could be regarded as sufficient for the exhaustion of domestic remedies. However, on the facts of the present case, in which the allegation of bias on the part of the chair and secretary of an Electoral Commission is closely linked to the other aspects of the applicant’s complaint about a violation of his right to free elections, the Court considers it appropriate to join the Government’s objection to the merits of the application. The complaint is not inadmissible on any other ground, and it must therefore be declared admissible.\n45: The applicant claimed that he had received more votes than his rival candidate, but was denied the seat in parliament owing to the unfair counting procedure, on the basis of the unfettered discretion of the constituency Electoral Commission.\n46: The Government maintained that there had been no serious violations of electoral law during the elections in constituency no. 72 and the irregularities which did occur had been duly and promptly reported and remedied by the CEC.\n47: The Government maintained that the margin between the two main candidates, the applicant and Mr G., was slim and even a handful of votes could tip the balance. They argued that the fact that so-called “wasted votes”, a phenomenon which is not unique to  and pertains to other electoral systems, influenced the outcome of the elections in constituency no. 72 could not be attributed to the State’s failure to “ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature”. The Government next stated that the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 had come to the reasonable conclusion that the breaches of the electoral law which had occurred during the vote in the four divisions in issue constituted an impediment to the establishment of the voters’ wishes. This conclusion had been reviewed by the CEC and the Supreme Court and had been found to be lawful and reasonable.\n48: Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 appears at first sight to differ from the other rights guaranteed in the Convention and the Protocols thereto, as it is phrased in terms of the obligation of the High Contracting Party to hold elections which ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people rather than in terms of a particular right or freedom. However, having regard to the preparatory work to Article 3 of the Protocol and the interpretation of the provision in the context of the Convention as a whole, the Court has established that it guarantees individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election (see, among many other authorities, Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 2 March 1987, §§ 46-51, Series A no. 113; Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, § 56-57, ECHR 2005-IX; and, more recently, Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, § 102, ECHR 2006-IV). Furthermore, the Court has considered that this Article guarantees the individual’s right to stand for election and, once elected, to sit as a member of parliament (see Lykourezos v. Greece, no. 33554/03, § 50, ECHR 2006VIII).\n49: The rights guaranteed under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are crucial to establishing and maintaining the foundations of an effective and meaningful democracy governed by the rule of law. Nonetheless, those rights are not absolute. There is room for “implied limitations”, and Contracting States must be given a margin of appreciation in this sphere. In this field, Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation, provided that they ensure equality of treatment for all citizens. It does not follow, however, that all votes must necessarily have equal weight as regards the outcome of the election or that all candidates must have equal chances of victory. Thus no electoral system can eliminate “wasted votes” (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 54).\n50: It is, however, for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 201, ECHR 2000-IV). Any departure from the principle of universal suffrage risks undermining the democratic validity of the legislature thus elected and the laws which it promulgates. Exclusion of any groups or categories of the general population must accordingly be reconcilable with the underlying purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see Sukhovetskyy v. Ukraine, no. 13716/02, § 52, ECHR 2006-VI).\n51: The applicant’s complaints in the present case were focused on the way the count was carried out in the electoral constituency where he was registered as a candidate. In particular he contended that the decisions to declare the vote in electoral divisions nos. 14, 45, 58 and 67 invalid were unfair and unreasonable.\n52: The Government, referring to the impossibility of avoiding “wasted votes”, contended that the impugned decisions of the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 were aimed at eliminating the detrimental impact of breaches of electoral law on the free choice of voters. The Court has doubts as to whether a practice discounting all votes at a polling station at which irregularities have taken place, regardless of the extent of the irregularity and the impact on the outcome of the result in the constituency, can at all be seen as pursing a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. However, the Court is not required to take a final view on this issue in the light of its findings below.\n53: The object and purpose of the Convention, which is an instrument for the protection of human rights, requires its provisions to be interpreted and applied in such a way as to make their stipulations not theoretical or illusory but practical and effective (see, for example, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, § 33, and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 100, ECHR 1999III).\n54: In Podkolzina v. Latvia (no. 46726/99, ECHR 2002-II), the Court reiterated that the right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime, would only be illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment. Consequently, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires the finding that this or that candidate has failed to satisfy them to comply with a number of criteria framed to prevent arbitrary decisions. In particular, such a finding must be reached by a body which can provide a minimum of guarantees of its impartiality. Similarly, the discretion enjoyed by the body concerned must not be exorbitantly wide; it must be circumscribed, with sufficient precision, by the provisions of domestic law. Lastly, the procedure for declaring a candidate ineligible must be such as to ensure a fair and objective decision and prevent any abuse of power on the part of the relevant authority (ibid., § 35).\n55: The present case concerns not eligibility conditions as such but the way in which the outcome of elections was reviewed by the responsible domestic authorities. The State’s latitude remains broad in this field, too, but cannot oust the Court’s review of whether a given decision was arbitrary.\n56: By way of example, in two previous cases, I.Z. v. Greece (no. 18997/91, Commission decision of 28 February 1994, Decisions and Reports 76-A) and Babenko v. Ukraine ((dec.), no. 43476/98, 4 May 1999), the Convention bodies examined the complaints of unsuccessful candidates of the unfairness of the electoral procedures. Those complaints were rejected because, in the absence of genuine prejudice to the outcome of the elections in issue, the situation complained of did not amount to an interference with the free expression of the people. This approach, however, cannot be applied in the present case as, and the Government accepted this in their observations, the annulment of the vote in the four divisions concerned led directly to the declaration of Mr G., and not the applicant, as the successful candidate.\n57: The 2001 Parliamentary Elections Act provided that the vote in the electoral divisions could be declared invalid on the basis of the grounds laid down in section 70 or, alternately, on the basis of “other circumstances” which made the establishment of the voters’ wishes impossible, provided for in section 72 (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above).\n58: Section 70 of this Act addressed specifically the situation of multiple voting by one person, stipulating that the vote in the division may be declared invalid only if the number of spoilt ballots reached the threshold of 10% of the total votes cast. As regards section 72, it is to be noted that there was no legal provision or domestic practice capable of giving an explanation as to which factors may be regarded as “other circumstances”. In particular, it was unclear whether the “other circumstances” had to be circumstances which were not foreseen by section 70, or whether they opened the possibility for the Electoral Commissions and, on appeal, the courts to circumvent the wording of section 70 by interpreting “other circumstances” as including those matters covered by that provision. Further, whilst section 70 enumerated events during elections which could result in a vote being declared invalid, section 72 was intended to regulate the procedure for examination of voting records, rather than dealing directly with the events.\n59: This lack of clarity of section 72 of the 2001 Parliamentary Elections Act and the potential risks to the enjoyment of electoral rights inherent in its interpretation by the domestic authorities called for particular caution on their part. The constituency Electoral Commission, however, in its decisions nos. 40 and 41 simply referred back to the previous decisions, and claimed that the irregularities established and noted by observers constituted “other circumstances” which made it impossible to establish the will of the electorate. The previous decision no. 36 to which reference was made stated that the deposition of several invalid ballots, as witnessed by Mr G.’s observers to electoral divisions nos. 14, 45 and 58, and the fact that members of the Electoral Commission of division no. 67 had opened the sealed polling station and retrieved voting records and several invalid ballots (see paragraph 10 above) were sufficient to declare all of the votes cast in these divisions invalid.\n60: In none of these decisions, nor in the subsequent decisions of the CEC or the Supreme Court, was there a discussion of the conflict between sections 70 and 72 of the 2001 Parliamentary Elections Act; nor was there a discussion of the credibility of the various actors in the elections. In addition, none of the decisions contained any explanation as to why (particularly in the light of section 70) the perceived breaches obscured the outcome of the vote in divisions nos. 14, 45, 58 and 67 to such an extent that it became impossible to establish the wishes of voters.\n61: Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the Court concludes that the decision to annul the vote in the four electoral divisions must be considered as arbitrary, and not proportionate to any legitimate aim pleaded by the Government. It follows that in this case there has been a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n62: That being so, the Court considers that it is not necessary to rule on the applicant’s complaints that the members of the Electoral Commission of constituency no. 72 lacked the required impartiality as they had published an appeal to voters, that the recount of 7 April 2002 had been tainted with breaches of domestic electoral law and that the security of the ballot boxes had been compromised. It is further not necessary to examine the Government’s non-exhaustion plea in respect of the complaints of bias on the part of the officers of that Electoral Commission.\n63: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n64: The applicant submitted that his claim in respect of pecuniary damage related to the loss of salary due to him as a member of the Verkhovna Rada. He claimed 144,000  dollars (USD) (107,250 euros (EUR)) in compensation, which was based on the approximate salary of a member of parliament, and which he would have received had he been elected.\n65: The Government noted that there was no causal link between the applicant’s compensation claims and the violation found.\n66: As noted at paragraph 56 above, the annulment of the vote in the four divisions led directly to the declaration of Mr G., and not the applicant, as a member of parliament. It is true that, if elected, the applicant would have received a salary as a member of parliament. That is not, however, sufficient to award the sums claimed, because the sums claimed would have to be set off against other income which he may have been receiving and which he would have had to forego if elected, as in Lykourezos v. Greece (no. 33554/03, § 64, ECHR 2006-VIII), in which the applicant was prevented from continuing to exercise his mandate. The applicant has given details of the salary he would have received as a member of parliament, but has not specified what his net loss would have been. The Court accordingly dismisses the applicant’s claims under this head.\n67: The applicant claimed USD 56,000 (EUR 41,715) in compensation for the anguish and distress which he had allegedly suffered on account of the violation of his electoral rights.\n68: The Government considered the sum claimed by the applicant unsubstantiated and excessive.\n69: The Court acknowledges that the applicant suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of the violation found. Consequently, ruling on an equitable basis and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it awards him EUR 8,000 under this head.\n70: The applicant did not submit any claim under this head within the set time-limit; the Court therefore makes no award in this respect.\n71: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

                "CASE OF KERIMOVA v. AZERBAIJAN; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 20799/06) against the Republic of Azerbaijan lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Azerbaijani national, Ms Flora Alakbar qizi Kerimova (Flora Ələkbər qızı Kərimova – “the applicant”), on 23 May 2006.\n2: The applicant was represented by Mr F. Ağayev, a lawyer practising in . The Azerbaijani Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Ç. Asgarov.\n3: The applicant alleged, in particular, that the invalidation of the parliamentary elections in her constituency had infringed her electoral rights under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\n4: On 3 September 2008 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.\n5: The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in .\n6: She stood for the elections to the Milli Majlis (Parliament) of 6 November 2005 as a candidate of the opposition bloc Azadliq. She was registered as a candidate by the Constituency Electoral Commission (“the ConEC”) for the singlemandate Sumgayit Second Electoral Constituency no. 42.\n7: The constituency was divided into thirty-seven electoral precincts, with one polling station in each precinct. There were a total of fifteen candidates running for election in this constituency.\n8: At the end of election day, the applicant obtained copies of the election protocols drawn up by each of the thirty-seven Precinct Electoral Commissions (“the PEC”). According to the copies of the PEC protocols in the applicant's possession, she received the largest number of votes in the constituency. Specifically, she received a total of 5,566 votes. The second highest number of votes, 3,922 votes in total, was received by a candidate from the ruling Yeni Azerbaijan Party (H.). The applicant received the highest number of votes in thirty polling stations, while H. received the highest number of votes in seven polling stations.\n9: According to the ConEC protocol drawn up on 7 November 2005 following an official tabulation of results received from the precincts, the applicant obtained the highest number of votes cast in the constituency. Specifically, according to the ConEC protocol, the applicant received 5,350 votes, H. received 4,091 votes, and a third candidate received 1,532 votes. The total number of votes cast for each of the remaining candidates was substantially lower. The ConEC protocol indicated the applicant as “the elected candidate”.\n10: On 8 November 2005 the Central Election Commission (“the CEC”) issued a decision invalidating the election results in Sumgayit Second Electoral Constituency no. 42. The decision, in its entirety, stated as follows:\n11: On 11 November 2005 the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with the Court of Appeal, arguing that the findings in the CEC decision were wrong. While the CEC decision noted that “impermissible alterations” had been made to the protocols of sixteen PECs, in reality such alterations had been made to the protocols of only five  (in Polling Stations nos. 8, 10, 11, 21 and 24). The applicant noted that this conclusion could be arrived at by simply comparing the ConEC protocol with the copies of the PEC protocols in her possession. She further noted that, on each occasion, the alterations had been made to reduce the number of votes cast in her favour and to increase the number of H.'s votes. Even though these falsifications were directed against the applicant, she was still the winner according to the falsified results announced by the ConEC.\n12: As to the alterations made in the remaining eleven PEC protocols, the applicant argued that they were of a technical nature and did not affect the number of votes cast for each candidate. Therefore, those alterations could not impede the determination of the will of the voters.\n13: The applicant further complained that the CEC had failed to consider the possibility of ordering a recount of the votes as required by Article 108.4 of the Electoral Code and to summon her as the candidate and hear her explanation as required by Article 112.8 of the Electoral Code.\n14: Lastly, the applicant noted that the ConEC protocol had been submitted to the CEC on the night of 7 to 8 November 2005 and the issue of invalidation of the election results had been put immediately on the CEC agenda on 8 November. As a result, due to lack of time, some CEC members had received incomplete or misleading information about the matter and had thus made an uninformed decision.\n15: During the hearing held on 14 November 2005, the judges of the Court of Appeal refused to independently examine the originals of the PEC and ConEC protocols. The Court of Appeal upheld the CEC decision by reiterating the findings made in that decision and concluding that the invalidation of the election results based on those findings had been lawful.\n16: The applicant lodged a cassation appeal. Apart from the arguments advanced in her appeal before the Court of Appeal, she also complained, inter alia, that the Court of Appeal had refused to independently examine the primary evidence (the originals of the relevant election protocols) and had simply taken the CEC's findings as fact.\n17: On 25 November 2005 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's appeal and upheld the Court of Appeal's judgment as lawful.\n18: Subsequently, it was decreed to hold repeat elections in all constituencies in which the election results had been invalidated. There were a total of ten such constituencies. It appears that, owing to certain opposition forces' decision to boycott the repeat elections, the applicant did not stand for election in the repeat elections held on 13 May 2006.\n19: In the meantime, criminal proceedings were instituted against the ConEC chairman and the chairman of the PEC of Polling Station no. 17, for tampering with the official PEC protocols of a total of nine different polling stations (Polling Stations nos. 1, 5, 8, 11, 17, 19, 20, 21 and 24).\n20: On 19 January 2006 the Sumgayit City Court convicted both the defendants under Articles 161.1 (falsification of election documents) and 308.1 (abuse of official power) of the Criminal Code. The first defendant was fined in the amount of 110 new Azerbaijani manats (approximately 100 euros) and was banned from holding office in the electoral administration. The second defendant was sentenced to one year and twenty-eight days' corrective labour, with 15% of his earnings to be withheld in favour of the State.\n21: The factual findings in the Sumgayit City Court's judgment, based on the defendant's own confessions and several witness statements, revealed that the majority of falsifications in the PEC protocols had been made at the ConEC level by its chairman, after the submission of the protocols to the ConEC. These falsifications were made in favour of either H. or other candidates, but not the applicant.\n22: In particular, during the hearings, the first defendant, the ConEC chairman, confessed that he had tampered with the PEC protocols for eight polling stations. In particular, he altered the figures representing the total vote count of various candidates in each polling station by inserting additional numbers or changing the existing numbers. In this manner, he increased the number of votes for at least five candidates other than the applicant (including H., to whose vote count he added 100 more “votes”), and reduced the number of votes received by the applicant (by 100 “votes”).\n23: The second defendant, the PEC chairman, confessed to having tampered with the PEC protocol for his polling station in a similar manner, with the aim of increasing the total vote counts of three candidates who were the applicant's opponents.\n24: After the count of votes in a polling station at the end of the election day, the PEC draws up an election protocol (in three original copies) documenting the results of the vote in the polling station (Articles 106.1106.6). One copy of the PEC protocol, together with other relevant documents, is then submitted to the relevant ConEC within 24 hours (Article 106.7). The ConEC verifies whether the PEC protocol complies with the law and whether it contains any inconsistencies (Article 107.1). After submission of all PEC protocols, the ConEC tabulates, within two days of election day, the results from the different polling stations and draws up a protocol reflecting the aggregate results of the vote in the constituency (Article 107.2). One copy of the ConEC protocol, together with other relevant documents, is then submitted to the CEC within two days of election day (Article 107.4). The CEC checks whether the ConEC protocols comply with the law and whether they contain any inconsistencies (Article 108.1) and draws up its own final protocol reflecting the results of the elections in all constituencies (Article 108.2).\n25: If within four days of election day the CEC discovers mistakes, impermissible alterations or inconsistencies in protocols (including the accompanying documents) submitted by ConECs, the CEC may order a recount of the votes in the relevant electoral constituency (Article 108.4).\n26: Upon review of a request to invalidate the election win by a registered candidate, an electoral commission has a right to hear submissions from citizens and officials and to obtain necessary documents and materials (Article 112.8).\n27: In case of discovery of irregularities aimed at assisting candidates who have not ultimately been elected, such irregularities cannot be a basis for invalidation of election results (Article 114.5).\n28: The ConEC or CEC may invalidate the election results in an entire single-mandate constituency if election results in two-fifths of polling stations, representing more than one-quarter of the constituency electorate, have been invalidated (Article 170.2.2).\n29: According to former Article 106.3.6 of the Electoral Code in force at the material time, during the initial vote-counting at a polling station at the end of election day, upon discovery in the ballot-box of a voting ballot which had not been properly placed in the corresponding envelope, the vote on that ballot was considered to be invalid. Article 106.3.6 was subsequently repealed on 2 June 2008.\n30: The relevant excerpts from the report read as follows:\n31: Relying on Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and Article 13 of the Convention, the applicant complained that the invalidation of election results in her constituency had been arbitrary and unlawful and had infringed her electoral rights as the rightful winner of the election. She argued that the process of invalidation had lacked transparency and sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness, and that the decisions of the electoral commissions and domestic courts lacked any factual basis and were contrary to a number of requirements of the domestic electoral law.\n32: The Court considers that this complaint falls to be examined only under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and that no separate examination is necessary under Article 13. Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 reads as follows:\n33: The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n34: The Government submitted that the CEC's decision to invalidate the election results in the applicant's electoral constituency had been based on sound factual findings. These findings were subsequently proved to have been correct by the outcome of the criminal proceedings against the two officials of the ConEC for Sumgayit Second Electoral Constituency no. 42 and the PEC for Polling Station no. 17 of that constituency. Both of these officials confessed to having tampered with the election protocols.\n35: As to the applicant's argument that the CEC had failed to order a recount, the Government argued that Article 108.4 of the Electoral Code did not require the CEC to recount the votes in all cases, but simply vested it with discretion to decide whether a recount of votes should be ordered in each particular case. The Government further argued that the recount of votes had not been possible in the present case, because in accordance with Article 106.3.6 of the Electoral Code in force at the material time (this provision was subsequently repealed in 2008), ballots which were not in envelopes were considered invalid. As all the ballots submitted to the CEC had already been pulled out of their envelopes during the original count in the relevant polling stations and had not been put back into them, the recount of these ballots was impossible.\n36: The Government argued that the established incidents of tampering with election protocols had made it impossible for the CEC to determine the true will of the voters on the basis of those protocols. Such interference with the procedure of the vote-count documentation interfered with the free expression of the opinion of the people and, therefore, the CEC had correctly invalidated the election results in the constituency, as it was guided by the legitimate aim of ensuring that only the candidates elected in accordance with the will expressed by voters represented those voters in the Parliament.\n37: The applicant submitted that she had won the election convincingly by a high margin of votes. The relevant results protocols, both before and after the tampering, indicated her as a winner. Although the tampering with the election protocols resulted in a considerable reduction in the total number of votes counted as cast for her, and a corresponding increase in the number of those cast for her main opponent, she was still the clear winner of the election even according to the results reflected in the protocols which had been tampered with. Thus, even after the tampering, the relevant protocols showed that the applicant had won by a margin of 1,259 votes.\n38: The applicant noted that all the impermissible changes introduced to the election protocols had been made in favour of her opponents, and not in her favour. Despite this, the CEC failed to comply with Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code, which did not allow invalidation of election results if it was established that any irregularities discovered during the election process had been made to assist the candidates who had not been ultimately elected, and not the winning candidate.\n39: The applicant noted that out of sixteen protocols which had been allegedly tampered with only five contained impermissible alterations of the total vote counts of candidates. The remaining protocols contained alterations of a “technical nature” which did not affect the figures on the total number of votes cast, and therefore could not impede the determination of the true will of the voters.\n40: As for the Government's argument concerning the alleged impossibility of a recount of votes, the applicant noted that the Government's reference to former Article 106.3.6 of the Electoral Code was wrong, because that provision concerned only the original count of the votes in polling stations at the end of election day, when the envelopes containing the ballots were first taken out of the ballot boxes, and did not concern any subsequent recount of votes in the presence of the CEC members. In any event, the applicant considered that on the facts of the case there was no need for a recount, for the simple reason that her victory in the election could be established beyond any doubt even from the protocols tampered with in favour of her opponents.\n41: The applicant submitted that there were no legitimate grounds for invalidation of the election results. Such a decision in the present case meant in essence that the domestic electoral system allowed one random person to frustrate the opinion of tens of thousands of voters simply by introducing minor alterations to election protocols. This in turn gave the current Government the opportunity to prevent opposition candidates from becoming members of parliament by simply having an electoral official tamper with an election protocol in order to render the results of the election null and void, and subsequently escape with a very lenient penalty for doing this. In this connection, the applicant noted that the ConEC chairman who had been found guilty of ruining the election results had received a very mild punishment in the form of a small fine and, despite his conviction, was reinstated to work in the public service in 2008.\n42: Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 appears at first sight to differ from the other rights guaranteed in the Convention and Protocols, as it is phrased in terms of the obligation of the High Contracting Party to hold elections which ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people rather than in terms of a particular right or freedom. However, the Court has established that it guarantees individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 2 March 1987, §§ 46-51, Series A no. 113). The Court has consistently highlighted the importance of the democratic principles underlying the interpretation and application of the Convention and has emphasised that the rights guaranteed under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are crucial to establishing and maintaining the foundations of an effective and meaningful democracy governed by the rule of law (ibid., § 47; see also Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, § 58, ECHR 2005-IX).\n43: The rights bestowed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are not absolute. There is room for “implied limitations” and Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation in the sphere of elections (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 52; Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, § 63, ECHR 1999-I; and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 201, ECHR 2000-IV). It is, however, for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with. In particular, it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 52, and Gitonas and Others v. Greece, 1 July 1997, § 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV). Such conditions must not thwart the free expression of the people in the choice of the legislature – in other words, they must reflect, or not run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage (see Hirst (no. 2), cited above, § 62).\n44: Furthermore, the object and purpose of the Convention, which is an instrument for the protection of human rights, requires its provisions to be interpreted and applied in such a way as to make their stipulations not theoretical or illusory but practical and effective (see, among many other authorities, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 33, Reports 1998-I; Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 100, ECHR 1999-III; and Lykourezos v. Greece, no. 33554/03, § 56, ECHR 2006-VIII). The right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime, would only be illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment. Consequently, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires that the eligibility procedure contain sufficient safeguards to prevent arbitrary decisions (see Podkolzina v. Latvia, no. 46726/99, § 35, ECHR 2002-II). Although originally stated in connection with the conditions on eligibility to stand for election, the principle requiring prevention of arbitrariness is equally relevant in other situations where the effectiveness of individual electoral rights is at stake (see Namat Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 18705/06, § 72, 8 April 2010), including the manner of review of the outcome of elections and invalidation of election results (see Kovach v. Ukraine, no. 39424/02, § 55 et seq., ECHR 2008-...).\n45: The Court has emphasised that it is important for the authorities in charge of electoral administration to function in a transparent manner and to maintain impartiality and independence from political manipulation (see The Georgian Labour Party v. Georgia, no. 9103/04, § 101, 8 July 2008), that the proceedings conducted by them be accompanied by minimum safeguards against arbitrariness and that their decisions are sufficiently reasoned (see, mutatis mutandis, Namat Aliyev, cited above, §§ 81-90, and Kovach, cited above, §§ 59-60).\n46: The Government contended that the impugned decision on the invalidation of election results was aimed at protecting the free expression of the voters' opinion from illegal interference and ensuring that only the rightfully elected candidates represented the voters in the Parliament. However, the Court has doubts as to whether a practice of discounting all votes cast in an entire electoral constituency owing merely to the fact that irregularities have taken place in some polling stations, regardless of the extent of the irregularities and their impact on the outcome of the overall election results in the constituency, can necessarily be seen as pursuing a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (compare, mutatis mutandis, Kovach, cited above, § 52). However, the Court is not required to take a final view on this issue in the light of its findings below.\n47: It is sufficiently clear from the material available in the case file that, according to the copies of PEC protocols obtained by the applicant from each of the polling stations at the end of election day (before the incidents of tampering with protocols took place), the applicant received a total of 5,566 votes against H.'s 3,992 votes. According to the ConEC protocol issued on the basis of those PEC protocols, after some of those protocols had been tampered with, the applicant received 5,350 votes against H.'s 4,091 votes. Thus, it is obvious that the election results, as they stood both before and after the irregularities involving illegal alterations to protocols, showed that the applicant was the clear winner of the elections. Moreover, neither the CEC nor the domestic courts hearing appeals against its decision, nor the Sumgayit City Court, dealing with the criminal case concerning the irregularities in question, ever found that any of the illegal alterations had been made to assist the applicant's cause. On the contrary, it was found by the Sumgayit City Court that they had been made exclusively in favour of her opponents. Neither did the Government, in their observations, argue that the irregularities had been intended to benefit the applicant. Accordingly, even despite the fact that these irregularities had been made in an attempt to inflate her opponents' vote counts and decrease her vote count, the election results still showed the applicant as a clear winner. In such circumstances, the Court finds it hard to understand the electoral authorities' and the Government's position that these irregularities had somehow made it “impossible to determine the will of the voters” in the entire constituency. On the contrary, the Court considers that the facts of the case clearly disclose a situation where the irregularities, however grave they might have been, did not impact the ultimate result of the election and failed to cast any doubt on the choice made by the majority of voters in the constituency.\n48: Moreover, as to the CEC decision of 8 November 2005 invalidating the election results in the applicant's constituency, the Court notes that it contained no specific description of the alleged “impermissible alterations” made to the PEC protocols or other “infringements of law”, no elaboration as to the nature of these “alterations” and “infringements”, and no reasons explaining as to why the alleged breaches obscured the outcome of the vote in the relevant polling stations and made it impossible to determine the true opinion of the voters. In such circumstances the Court cannot but note that the CEC decision was totally unsubstantiated.\n49: As to the parties' submissions concerning the recount of votes, the Court agrees with the applicant that such a recount was in any event redundant because it was possible to establish who was the winning candidate even despite the irregularities. Nevertheless, the Court finds alarming the CEC's failure to even consider the possibility of a recount before invalidating the election results. The Court considers that, in cases where illegal tampering with vote counting or election documents may affect the determination of the outcome of the elections, a fair procedure for recounting votes where such a recount is possible is an important safeguard of the fairness and success of the entire election process. Even accepting the Government's argument that under Azerbaijani law an election recount was optional (at the CEC's discretion) and not mandatory, the Court considers that in the present case the CEC could have considered the possibility of a recount and at least explained the reasons for passing up this opportunity before deciding on an outright invalidation of the election results. In the Court's view, the CEC's failure to do so contributed to the appearance of arbitrariness of its decision.\n50: As to the Government's argument that the recount was not possible owing to the conflicting requirements of former Article 106.3.6 of the Electoral Code, the Court finds this argument misplaced. Firstly, as noted above, it was up to the CEC to explain the reasons for not ordering a recount and it failed to offer such reasons. Secondly, it appears that former Article 106.3.6 of the Electoral Code (see paragraph 29 above) concerned the determination of the validity of the ballots at the moment when they were taken out of the ballot boxes for the original count. Once a ballot was pulled out of its envelope, determined to be valid and counted during the original count, nothing could prevent the use of this ballot at any subsequent election recount. Thirdly, the Court generally finds that it is unacceptable to rely solely on such irrelevant and petty formalities in order to justify a failure to abide by statutorily-prescribed safeguards of the integrity of the electoral process.\n51: Furthermore, having regard to the CEC decision of 8 November 2005, the Court notes that the CEC first invalidated the election results in sixteen polling stations owing to the alleged irregularities, and then proceeded to rely on Article 170.2.2 of the Electoral Code in order to invalidate the election results in the entire constituency based on the fact that the elections in two-fifths of the total number of polling stations representing more than one-quarter of the constituency electorate had been annulled. However, the Court finds it troubling that, upon invalidating the elections both in the relevant polling stations and in the entire constituency, the CEC ignored the requirements of Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code, which prohibited invalidation of election results at any level on the basis of a finding of irregularities committed for the benefit of candidates who lost the election (see paragraph 27 above). This rule protected the opinion of the electorate, as well as the interests of a candidate who received the highest number of votes and who was not responsible for any irregularities, from any unlawful actions attempted against such winning candidate. As such, this rule was aimed at preventing a situation where a winning candidate is wrongfully punished by being deprived of his or her victory in the election for malfeasance attributable to his or her losing opponents. In this connection, the Court notes that the situation envisaged in Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code is the direct opposite of a situation where irregularities are found to have been allegedly made to the benefit of the “winning” candidate (contrast Namat Aliyev, cited above, §§ 9-18, 64, 67 and 74). However, the Court observes that, despite the expressly stated requirement of Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code, neither the CEC, at the time of making its decision to annul the election, nor the domestic courts dealing with the appeals against its decision, made an attempt to determine in whose favour the alleged irregularities had been made. In any event, the subsequent criminal proceedings at the Sumgayit City Court established that all the illegal alterations to the PEC protocols had been made exclusively for the benefit of the applicant's opponents. Finally, as noted above, even despite these illegal alterations, the applicant still emerged as the candidate with the largest number of votes and it has never even been suggested by any of the domestic authorities that she could be responsible for any of the irregularities in question. In such circumstances, it is all but apparent that the decision to invalidate the election results in the applicant's constituency, and thus deprive her of the parliamentary seat, not only lacked any relevant substantiation but was also made in breach of the requirement of Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code. At the very least, the failure to take this requirement into account, and the lack of any explanation for such failure, contributed to the appearance of arbitrariness of the annulment of the election.\n52: Lastly, the Court notes that, despite the fact that the applicant repeatedly raised all of the above points in her appeals to the domestic courts, the courts failed to adequately address these issues and simply reiterated the CEC's findings. They refused to examine any primary evidence, which primarily consisted of the illegally altered originals of the PEC protocols, and failed to review the compliance of the CEC's decision with the requirements of the electoral law. As such, the manner of examination of the applicant's election-related appeals was ineffective.\n53: The authorities' inadequate approach to this matter brought about a situation where the whole election process in the entire electoral constituency was essentially single-handedly sabotaged by two low-ranking electoral officials, who had abused their position to make some changes to a number of election protocols that were in their possession. By arbitrarily invalidating the election results because of these officials' actions, the domestic authorities essentially aided and abetted them in thwarting the election. Such lack of concern for integrity of the electoral process from within the electoral administration cannot be considered compatible with the spirit of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\n54: In view of the above, the Court concludes that, while the perpetrators of the irregularities, which ostensibly “necessitated” the authorities' decision to invalidate the election results, did not appear to succeed in their aim of affecting the ultimate outcome of the elections, the invalidation decision itself “succeeded” in doing so. The annulment of the elections in the applicant's constituency lacked any relevant reasons and was in apparent breach of the procedure established by the domestic electoral law (see paragraph 51 above). This decision arbitrarily infringed the applicant's electoral rights by depriving her of the benefit of being elected to Parliament, and as such ran counter to the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage.\n55: There has accordingly been a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\n56: In conjunction with the above complaint, the applicant complained that despite clearly winning the election she was arbitrarily deprived of her seat in Parliament owing to her political affiliation with an opposition party. She relied on Article 14, which provides as follows:\n57: The Court notes that this complaint is linked to the one examined above and must therefore likewise be declared admissible.\n58: However, having regard to its above finding in relation to Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine whether in this case there has been a violation of Article 14.\n59: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n60: The applicant claimed 83,185.83 euros (EUR) for loss of the earnings she would have received in the form of a parliamentary member's salary if elected to the Milli Majlis had the results of elections in her constituency not been invalidated. She noted that her other income during the relevant period, as a retired singer and recipient of a State allowance, amounted only to 125 new Azerbaijani manats (AZN) (approximately EUR 120) per month.\n61: The Government contested the applicant's claim and argued that her other income must have been much higher than AZN 125 per month.\n62: The Court reiterates its analysis made in the Kovach case (cited above, § 66), which concerned a similar claim:\n63: In the earlier Lykourezos judgment (cited above, § 64), the Court approached the issue as follows:\n64: The Court notes that, unlike in the above cases, the applicant submitted detailed information about the difference between the salaries that she would have received as a member of parliament and her other income which she had been receiving during the relevant period, which information is in principle sufficient to calculate her “net loss”. The Court considers that, had the applicant become a member of parliament, she could have been expected to serve at least part of her tenure and received certain income from her service. Accordingly, she suffered certain pecuniary damage, although this damage cannot be technically quantified in terms of monthly salaries for the entire term of service of a member of parliament. Therefore, having regard to the inherent uncertainty in any attempt to estimate the real losses sustained by the applicant and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court decides to award her EUR 50,000 under this head.\n65: The applicant claimed EUR 100,000 in compensation for the anguish and distress caused to her by the infringement of her electoral rights.\n66: The Government argued that the amount claimed was unjustified and excessive.\n67: The Court considers that the applicant suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be compensated solely by the finding of the violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. Ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards her the sum of EUR 7,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.\n68: The applicant also claimed EUR 4,800 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court, including EUR 4,500 for legal fees and EUR 300 for postal expenses.\n69: The Government claimed that the claim in respect of legal fees was excessive and that the claim in respect of postal expenses was unsupported by any documents.\n70: According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. Having regard to the legal services actually rendered in the present case and to the services stipulated in the relevant contract concluded between the applicant and her lawyer, the Court considers that the amounts claimed do not correspond to the legal assistance that was actually provided in the present case. Therefore, only a partial award can be made in this respect. Furthermore, the Court notes that the applicant failed to support her claim for postal expenses with any documentary evidence and therefore no sum can be awarded in respect of those expenses.\n71: Regard being had to the above, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 1,600 for the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant on that sum.\n72: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

                "CASE OF RIZA AND OTHERS v. BULGARIA; § 1: The case originated in two applications against the Republic of Bulgaria: the first, no. 48555/10, was lodged by a Bulgarian national, Mr Rushen Mehmed Riza, and a Bulgarian political party, Dvizhenie za Prava i Svobodi (Movement for Rights and Freedoms – “DPS”), and the second, no. 48377/10, was lodged by 101 other Bulgarian nationals, whose names, dates of birth and places of residence are appended. Those two applications were lodged with the Court on 14 August 2010 under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”).\n2: All the applicants were represented by Ms S. O. Solakova, a lawyer practising in Sofia. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms N. Nikola and Ms A. Panova, of the Ministry of Justice.\n3: Mr Riza and the DPS, on the one hand, and the other 101 applicants, on the other, alleged, in particular, that the Bulgarian Constitutional Court’s decision to annul the election results in 23 polling stations set up outside the country during the 2009 Bulgarian general elections had amounted to an unjustified infringement of their right to stand for election and their right to vote, respectively, which rights were safeguarded by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\n4: On 4 April 2011 application no. 48555/10 lodged by Mr Riza and the DPS was communicated to the Government. On 8 July 2014 application no. 48377/10 lodged by 101 Bulgarian nationals was also communicated to the Government. As permitted under Article 29 § 1 of the Convention, it was also decided that the Chamber would adjudicate simultaneously on the admissibility and the merits of the applications.\n5: On 10 February 2015 the Chamber decided to join the two applications as permitted under Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court and to invite the judge elected in respect of Bulgaria, Z. Kalaydjieva, to participate in the subsequent examination of the case pursuant to Rule 26 § 3 of the Rules of Court.\n6: The 101 applicants, whose names are appended, are Bulgarian nationals of Turkish origin and/or of Muslim faith who live or have lived in Turkey. They all exercised their right to vote at the 2009 Bulgarian general elections in 17 of the polling stations set up in Turkish territory, the election results in which were subsequently contested by the RZS political party and nullified by the Bulgarian Constitutional Court.\n7: According to the official statistics from the census carried out in Bulgaria in 2011, 588,318 persons stated that they were ethnic Turks, amounting to 8.8% of the persons who answered that question, and 577,139 persons stated that they were of Muslim religion. Since the late 1980s, the members of those communities have been involved in major migrations leading many of them to settle in Turkey. The Court has no official information on the exact number of Bulgarian citizens who are ethnic Turks or Muslims living temporarily or permanently in Turkey. Estimates of that number vary considerably, generally ranging from 300,000 to 500,000 individuals, in all the age brackets.\n8: The DPS was founded in 1990. Its statutes define it as a liberal political party endeavouring to help unite all Bulgarian citizens and to protect the rights and freedoms of minorities in Bulgaria as guaranteed by the Constitution and national legislation, as well as by the international instruments ratified by the Republic of Bulgaria.\n9: The DPS has put up candidates for all general and local elections in Bulgaria since its inception. It has won seats in the national Parliament in all the general elections held since 1990. Between 2001 and 2009 it took part in two successive coalition governments. Several of its leaders and members belong to the Bulgarian Turkish and Muslim minorities.\n10: Mr Riza was born in 1968 and lives in Sofia. A DPS member, he is also one of its Vice-Presidents and a member of the party’s central executive bureau. He is currently a DPS deputy of the National Assembly.\n11: These two applicants submit that most of the Bulgarian citizens currently living in Turkey have voted for the DPS at all the general elections held over the last twenty years.\n12: By Decree of 28 April 2009 the Bulgarian President set 5 July 2009 as the date of the elections to the 41st National Assembly. The electoral law laid down a new hybrid electoral system: 31 deputies were to be elected on a first-past-the-post basis in single-member constituencies, and 209 deputies were to be elected on a proportional basis at national level in 31 multiple-member constituencies.\n13: Bulgarian citizens living abroad were entitled to vote in the general elections, but only for parties and coalitions, and their votes were taken into account in the proportional distribution of sears among the different political formations at the national level ... Having obtained the consent of the competent authorities in the countries concerned, the Bulgarian diplomatic representations opened 274 polling stations in 59 countries, 123 of them in Turkey.\n14: On 20 May 2009 the Central Electoral Commission registered the DPS as participating in the general elections. The DPS presented lists of candidates in several single- and multiple-member constituencies. It was also included on the ballot paper designed for voting by Bulgarian citizens living abroad. Mr Riza was included in second position on the list of his party’s candidates for the 8th multiple-member constituency (Dobrich).\n15: Thirteen of the 101 applicants (see appended list) (nos., 13, 17, 21, 26, 30, 39, 51, 59, 74, 75, 89 and 94) submitted that they had all personally submitted prior declarations of intention to vote to the Bulgarian diplomatic representations in Turkey. The Bulgarian diplomates has asked them to take part in local electoral committees in Istanbul, Bursa, Çerkezköy, Çorlu and İzmir as presidents, secretaries or ordinary members, which they had agreed to do. On 4 July 2009 they had been invited to the offices of the Bulgarian diplomatic and consular representations, where Bulgarian diplomats had informed them about the formalities to be complied with on election day, and in particular how to draw up the electoral rolls. Some of the applicants affirmed that they had only been given one instruction on that subject, to the effect that persons attending the polling station on election day without preregistration should be included on the additional pages of the electoral roll, and that the last name added on election day should be suffixed with a “Z”.\n16: The 13 applicants submitted that their names had not been included on the list at the polling station where they were to function as members of the electoral committee. They had all voted in their respective polling stations by registering on election day and signing opposite their names and forenames. Furthermore, they submitted that they had carefully indicated their choices on their ballot papers, without any other type of indication, and slotted the papers into the ballot box.\n17: The 13 applicants also pointed out that there had been no particular problems on election day. Their respective electoral committees had been made up of Bulgarian nationals living in their respective towns and representatives of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some of the polling stations had been visited by the Bulgarian Ambassador and Consul General, and others had been reported on by Bulgarian public television and radio teams, and no irregularities had been noted. At the close of polling on election day the local committees had counted the votes, filled in the requisite report forms and submitted the electoral documents to the Bulgarian diplomatic representatives.\n18: The other 88 applicants submitted that at the material time they had been living in Turkey. Some of them had sent prior statements of intention to vote to the Bulgarian diplomatic representations, but they had never been informed in return of which polling stations to vote in. On election day all the applicants in question had attended the nearest polling stations in their respective towns. Their names had been handwritten into the electoral rolls, and after voting they signed opposite their names.\n19: According to information available on the Central Electoral Commission website (), following the 5 July 2009 elections, six political parties and coalitions garnered more than the minimum 4% of votes cast and were included in the process of proportional distribution of seats in the National Assembly: the GERB party, the Coalition for Bulgaria, the DPS, Ataka, the Blue Coalition and the RZS party.\n20: The DPS obtained a total of 610,521 votes, or 14.45% of the valid votes, which made it the country’s third political party. It garnered 61.18% of the out-of-country voting, that is to say 93,926 votes, 88,238 of which were cast in polling stations in Turkish territory. It came out well ahead in the 17 polling stations – in Istanbul, Bursa, Çerkezköy, Çorlu and İzmir – in which the 101 applicants had voted. By decision of 7 July 2009 the Central Electoral Commission assigned the DPS 33 parliamentary seats under the proportional representation system, together with a further five seats won in the first-past-the-post constituencies.\n21: Following the apportionment of seats won by the DPS at the national level in the 31 multiple-member constituencies, the party won only one seat in the 8th constituency. However, another political formation, the Blue Coalition, having appealed to the Constitutional Court and the votes cast in a polling station in the 19th constituency having been recounted, the Central Electoral Commission conducted a reassignment of the seats won at the national level among the 31 multiple-member constituencies. This gave the DPS a second seat in the 8th constituency, where Mr Riza was in second place on his list of candidates, and removed one of the two seats initially won in the 19th multiple-member constituency. On 12 October 2009 Mr Riza was declared elected to the National Assembly. He was sworn in as a deputy and became a member of his party’s parliamentary group. On 20 January 2010 he was elected member of the Parliamentary Commission on Ethics and the Fight against Corruption and Conflicts of Interest.\n22: On 21 July 2009 the President and three other members of the RZS (Red, Zakonnost, Spravedlivost – “Order, Law and Justice”), a right-wing conservative party, requested the Attorney General to lodge with the Constitutional Court the appeal provided for in section 112 of the Electoral Law in order to annul the election of seven DPS deputes on the grounds of several irregularities which had occurred in the 123 polling stations operating in Turkish territory. The four appellants complained of several breaches of electoral legislation in connection with the setting up of the said polling stations and their handling of the voting: they claimed that the rule requiring a polling station to be opened for every one hundred prior statements of intention to vote had been flouted in Turkish territory; some electors had exercised their voting rights once in Bulgarian national territory and again in a polling station in Turkish territory; incorrect information had been included in the reports drawn up by the electoral committees concerning the number of voters in the polling stations in question; 23 of them had allegedly dealt with over 1,000 voters, which would have been a practical impossibility in view of the opening hours of the polling station and the time required to complete the requisite formalities for each voter, and the electoral committees attached to those polling stations had, in certain cases, reportedly allowed persons into the voting booths without valid Bulgarian identity papers. The appellants invited the Constitutional Court to verify the authenticity of the prior voting requests issued in Turkish territory, to check the electoral rolls drawn up in the region of Bulgaria where the individuals wishing to vote in Turkey had their permanent addresses, and to declare null and void the records drawn up by the electoral committees responsible for the polling stations opened in Turkish territory. According to the appellants, the large number of irregularities committed in the voting procedure in the 123 polling stations in question necessitated the annulment of the votes cast in them, which annulment would have changed the election results and led to the ousting of seven DPS deputies from their seats.\n23: On 22 July 2009 the Attorney General transmitted the request submitted by the President and three other members of the RZS party to the Constitutional Court.\n24: On 11 August 2009 the Constitutional Court declared the appeal admissible and designated as parties to proceedings the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Central Electoral Commission, the National Department responsible for Citizens’ Civil Status Data and two non-governmental organisations. It sent copies of the request and the relevant documents to the parties to proceedings and gave them a deadline of twenty days to submit their observations on the merits of the case. That court asked the National Department responsible for Citizens’ Civil Status Data to ascertain how many voters had voted in the national territory and then again in Turkish territory, and invited it to submit certified copies of the lists of persons having voted and the reports on voting drawn up by the polling stations in Turkish territory. The President of the Constitutional Court, R.Y., and Judge B.P. signed the admissibility decision, while issuing a separate opinion. They argued that the Attorney General should have submitted a reasoned request to the Constitutional Court rather than merely transmitting the request for annulment lodged by the RZS political party.\n25: On 18 September 2009 the DPS parliamentary group of the National Assembly presented its written observations on the case. It first of all disputed the admissibility of the appeal lodged by the four appellants, arguing that the Attorney General had failed to conduct a prior assessment of the merits of the said request, merely transmitting it to the Constitutional Court, that the appeal had been lodged belatedly, after the deputies in question had been sworn in, and that the seven DPS deputies mentioned in the request had been designated randomly since the out-of-country votes had been used solely to apportion the seats among the various parties at the national level and not for the benefit of any given list of candidates. Secondly, the DPS parliamentary group submitted that the request had been ill-founded for the following reasons: the legal conditions for setting up the 123 polling stations in question had been fulfilled; there had been very few cases of double voting, and voting secrecy precluded determining for which party exactly those persons had voted; the number of persons included on the additional electoral rolls on election day had been higher than that of preregistered voters because the number of persons wishing to exercise their voting rights had far exceeded the number of voters having previously declared their intention to vote outside the country; and in several of the out-of-country polling stations the number of persons voting had exceeded one thousand, and that had not been the case only in the polling stations in Turkey.\n26: On 6 October 2009, at the request of the RZS party, the Constitutional Court ordered a threefold expert assessment to provide the answers to the following questions: (i) how many prior statements of intention to vote were submitted for the territory of Turkey, from which towns were they sent, and did their number correspond to the number of polling stations set up? (ii) were the identity papers of electors voting in the 123 polling stations valid? (iii) did the numbers of electors voting recorded in the minutes drawn up on election day correspond to the total number of preregistered electors and persons registered on the rolls on election day, and were there any polling stations in which none of the preregistered persons exercised their right to vote? (iv) what was the maximum number of persons who could vote in a polling station over election day? The three experts were given leave to consult all the documents on elections in Turkish territory which the diplomatic service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had submitted to the Central Electoral Commission.\n27: The expert report was submitted to the Constitutional Court some time later. It indicated that there had been a total of 27,235 prior declarations of intention to vote in respect of the territory of Turkey: 5,127 of those declarations had been received at the Bulgarian Embassy in Ankara, 15,556 at the Consulate General in Istanbul and 6,552 at the Consulate General in Edirne. The Bulgarian diplomatic services had opened 28 polling stations in the Ankara region, 72 in the Istanbul region and 23 in the Edirne region. The experts had noted that some polling stations had been opened without the threshold of 100 declarations of intention to vote having been reached.\n28: The experts were unable to answer the second question, on the validity of the Bulgarian identity papers of those voting in Turkey. They pointed out that it would have been very time-consuming to carry out the necessary verifications and would have required access to the population database administered by the Ministry of the Interior. Furthermore, in several cases the local electoral committees had merely mentioned the type of document presented, i.e. an identity card or passport, without recording the document number.\n29: As regards the third question, the experts replied that there had been some very slight differences – between one and five persons – between the numbers of persons voting recorded in the polling station minutes and the numbers of voters included in the electoral rolls. According to the experts, that might have been due to inadvertent omissions. Moreover, they observed that the additional electoral lists in 116 polling stations, which had been drawn up on election day and contained data on the persons who had turned out without having been preregistered, had not been signed by the chair or secretary of the local electoral committee. The experts noted that the personal data on electors contained in those lists had been handwritten, apparently unhurriedly, and those entries would have taken a considerable length of time to write. Furthermore, in some of the polling stations none of the preregistered persons had turned out to vote. In some other polling stations there had been no minutes on file, or else the first page of the minutes had been missing.\n30: As regards the fourth question put by the Constitutional Court, the experts concluded, from a reconstitution of the requisite formalities in dealing with voters and their ballot papers, that the minimum time required for voting would have been about fifty seconds. Having regard to the total duration of election day, that is to say thirteen hours, the experts estimated that a polling station could deal with a maximum of 936 voters. The maximum number of persons voting as thus calculated had been exceeded in 30 of the polling stations operating in Turkey.\n31: The National Department responsible for Citizens’ Civil Status Data presented the Constitutional Court with the results of its inquiry into cases of double voting. The department pointed out that 174 persons had voted several times and that 79 cases of double voting had been noted in Turkey.\n32: On 27 January 2010 the Constitutional Court decided to ask the three experts to examine an additional point: it asked them to recalculate the election results after deducting all the votes cast in 23 polling stations and some of those cast in another polling station, all located in Turkish territory. The court’s request covered: (i) all the votes cast in 18 polling stations where none of the preregistered voters had voted and where the additional lists of those voting had not been signed by the members of the local electoral committees and therefore lacked the probative value of official documents; (ii) all the votes cast in a polling station in which the minutes on voting were missing; (iii)  all the votes cast in two other polling stations where the first page of the minutes was missing; (iv)  all the votes cast in a polling station where the list of preregistered voters was missing; (v)  86 votes cast for the DPS by persons included in the unsigned additional list at another polling station where that party had garnered all the votes and where 124 preregistered persons had voted; (vi)  all the votes cast in another polling station where the list of preregistered voters had not been put on file and where the additional electoral list had not been signed by the members of the local electoral committee.\n33: On 2 February 2010 the experts submitted their supplementary conclusions to the Constitutional Court. In the introductory section of the report they pointed out that they had been mandated to deduct from the outcome of the election the votes cast in polling stations where: (i) none of the preregistered voters had voted and where the additional lists of those voting had not been signed by the members of the local electoral committees; (ii) the minutes were not put on file; (iii) the first page of the minutes was missing. The report presented estimates of the votes cast in 23 polling stations: (i) in 18 of those stations, none of the preregistered voters had voted and the additional list of voters had not been signed; (ii) in the case of another polling station, no minutes had been put on file and the additional list of voters had not been signed; (iii) for three other stations, the first page of the minutes was missing and the additional list of voters had not been signed; (iv) in another polling station, the first page of the minutes had not mentioned the number of persons having voted and none of the preregistered voters had voted. The experts considered that a total of 18,351 votes should be deducted from the election results, 18,140 of which had been case for the DPS. The Central Electoral Commission conducted the provisional reassignment of seats among the political parties on the basis of the expert report.\n34: On 9 February 2010 the parliamentary group of the DPS submitted supplementary observations challenging the Constitutional Court’s choice of criteria for excluding the votes cast in the aforementioned polling stations from the vote count. The DPS deputies pointed out that the outcome of the voting had been based on the data set out in the polling station minutes, and not on the electoral rolls. They added that electoral legislation did not require the chairs and secretaries of out-of-country local electoral committees to sign below the additional lists of voters drawn up on election day. At all events, in the deputies’ opinion, the shortcomings of members of the electoral administration could not lead to the annulment of electors’ votes.\n35: On 15 February 2010 the Central Electoral Commission presented its findings to the Constitutional Court. It pointed out that according to mathematical projections, the annulment of the votes cast in the 23 polling stations mentioned in the experts’ supplementary conclusions would deprive the DPS of one seat which would be assigned to the GERB political party and that in the 8th multiple-member constituency the DPS candidate concluded in second place on the party’s list, Mr Riza, would lose his parliamentary seat.\n36: The Central Electoral Commission presented the Constitutional Court with observations made by five of its twenty-five members on the merits of the case. Those five members voiced the opinion that the arguments put forward by the appellants and the experts’ conclusions could not be used to justify annulling the votes cast in the polling stations in question. They explained in particular that the lists of persons voting in the out-of-country polling stations had been drawn up by the Bulgarian diplomatic representatives accredited on the basis of the prior declarations of intention to vote which they had received. They nevertheless stated that no prior information had been given on the distribution of the voters in question around the various polling stations, as they could attend any polling station or choose not to vote at all, which in their view explained why in some stations none of the voters on the main list had voted. The members of the Electoral Commission considered that that should not lead to the invalidation of the ballots of other electors who had voted in the same polling station. They pointed out that under domestic legislation the election documents had to be packaged and sealed by the local electoral committees and then sent to the Central Electoral Commission. However, when the election documents had arrived from Turkey, it had been noted that the packages containing the documents had already been opened and then re-sealed by the diplomatic services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At all events, the absence, attributable to the Bulgarian diplomatic services or the local electoral committees, of election documents from out-of-county polling stations could not have justified annulling votes cast in those stations, given that the election results from outside the country had been based on data transmitted via diplomatic telegrams to the Central Electoral Commission. Finally, the members of the Electoral Commission, referring to domestic legislation, submitted that the fact that a member of the Electoral Commission had not signed minutes of voting or the accompanying documents did not invalidate them and did not constitute grounds for annulling the votes cast in the station in question. They considered that the recalculation of the election results was based on arguments which had not been mentioned in the request to the Constitutional Court.\n37: On 15 February 2010 the DPS and six of its deputies applied to the Constitutional Court for leave to join the proceedings in question as a party. In that application the DPS stated that it fully endorsed the observations submitted by its parliamentary group on 18 September 2009 and 9 February 2010. On 16 February 2010 Mr Riza requested leave to join the proceedings as a party. In order to demonstrate his interest in taking part in the proceedings he referred explicitly to the additional expert report ordered by the Constitutional Court and the reapportionment of seats effected by the Central Electoral Commission on the basis of the experts’ findings. All those requests remained unanswered.\n38: On 16 February 2010 the Constitutional Court, sitting in private session, adopted its decision in the case in question. It delivered its judgment on the same day.\n39: The Constitutional Court dismissed the pleas of inadmissibility put forward by the DPS parliamentary group in its observations of 18 September 2009 (see paragraph 25 above). It considered, first of all, that the procedure for applying to the court had been respected. Secondly, it observed that the case concerned the contestation of election results rather than the eligibility of an individual candidate, which enabled it to assess the case even though the deputies in question had been sworn in and were already in office. It joined to the merits of the case the third plea of inadmissibility concerning the lack of a direct link between the out-of-country votes and the election of the seven DPS deputies named in the initial request. Judges R.N. and B.P. set out separate opinions on the admissibility of the request for annulment of the election results. They considered that the Attorney General had merely transmitted the request submitted by the RZS party instead of himself lodging a reasoned application for the annulment of the elections.\n40: Considering that it should begin by clarifying the scope of the case, the Constitutional Court pointed out that it had been invited to find unlawful the election of a number of DPS deputies owing to several alleged irregularities in the polling stations operating in Turkish territory. Having regard to the specific mode of functioning of the Bulgarian electoral system, in which votes cast by Bulgarian citizens living abroad were taken into account solely for the proportional distribution of seats among political parties at the national level, it was impossible to determine in advance which deputies would be affected by the invalidation of some or all of the votes cast in Turkish territory. Thus, in the framework of that case, the Constitutional Court considered that it had been called upon to determine whether there had been any serious irregularities in the voting procedure in the 123 polling stations in Turkey. It held that a finding of such irregularities could lead to a change in the election results, a fresh apportionment of seats among the political parties and the annulment of the seats of deputies who had not been explicitly targeted by the initial application lodged by the leader and a number of candidates of the RZS party in the general elections.\n41: The Constitutional Court rejected all the arguments put forward in the initial statement of claim. It first of all noted that section 41 (8) (3) of the Electoral Law gave Bulgarian diplomatic representatives outside the country carte blanche to open as many polling stations as they considered necessary for the proper conduct of the elections.\n42: Secondly, it considered that the question whether a given voter had voted without a valid Bulgarian identity card was immaterial to the outcome of the proceedings, since voting secrecy ruled out ascertaining which party the person had voted for.\n43: The Constitutional Court stated that the experts had noted that in some polling stations none of those on the main electoral roll had voted, while in other stations only a few of those on the roll had voted. It pointed out that according to the experts the names added on election day had been written clearly and apparently unhurriedly, which would seem rather unlikely given the large number of such additions and the pressure under which the members of the electoral committees would have been working on election day. However, the Constitutional Court considered that such considerations were mere suspicions which had not categorically demonstrated that the results of voting in those polling stations had been manipulated.\n44: The Constitutional Court also noted that the experts had reached the conclusion that the maximum number of persons who could vote in one polling station was 936. However, it considered that in the absence of precise information on the alleged irregularities in the voting procedure in the polling stations with more than 1,000 persons voting, that finding did not provide grounds for invalidating the election results. At all event voting secrecy precluded determining for whom the persons registered after number 936 on the list of voters had cast their vote.\n45: For those reasons the Constitutional Court dismissed the application for the annulment of the seats of the seven deputies explicitly covered by the initial request submitted by the leader and candidates of the RZS party.\n46: However, it decided to deduct from the results obtained by each of the political parties respectively all the votes cast in 23 polling stations in Turkey, that is to say a total of 18,358 votes, 18,140 of which had been cast for the DPS. It pointed out that in those polling stations none of the voters preregistered on the main electoral rolls had voted, or else the first page of the minutes of the voting, certifying that the preregistered persons had voted, was missing. The court pointed out that in the 23 polling stations in question the additional lists of voters drawn up on election day did not bear the signatures of the chairs and secretaries of the local electoral committees, which deprived them of the probative value of official documents. The Constitutional Court accordingly considered that they could not be used in evidence to demonstrate that the registered persons had voted. That approach had allegedly also enabled it to determine how many votes had been deducted from the election results of each party or coalition and to reallocate the deputies’ seats in the National Assembly.\n47: The Constitutional Court rejected the additional objections raised by the DPS parliamentary group on 9 February 2010 (see paragraph 34 above). It considered that the irregularities noted in the electoral rolls in the various polling stations had also affected the legitimacy of the minutes drawn up by the electoral committee on completion of the voting because they contained data on the exact number of persons having voted in the polling station in question and the election results had been determined on the basis of the minutes. Even though domestic legislation did not explicitly require the members of the out-of-country local electoral committees to sign additional electoral lists, the module additional electoral list approved by the President of the Republic pursuant to the Electoral Law provided for such signatures. The Constitutional Court therefore took the view that such signature was a legal condition for the validity of such official documents. At all events, the signature was one of the fundamental and obvious components of any official document. The lack of those signatures on the additional voter lists drawn up in the 23 polling stations thus deprived them of their official probative value in respect of the fact that the registered persons had actually cast their votes.\n48: The Constitutional Court declared that the votes in question had been valid under domestic legislation but that they had been deducted from the election results owing to the irregularity of the voter lists and the voting minutes. It considered that the seats in the National Assembly had to be reallocated. For those reasons, and having taken into account the prior calculations submitted by the Central Electoral Commission, the Constitutional Court annulled the parliamentary seats of three deputies, including Mr Riza. It ordered the Central Electoral Commission to reapportion the seats in the National Assembly by deducting from the election results the 18,358 votes cast in the 23 polling stations in question.\n49: By decision of 19 February 2010, pursuant to the judgment of the Constitutional Court, the Central Electoral Commission declared three other candidates elected. Consequently to that redistribution of seats, the DPS was the only party to have lost a parliamentary seat and the GERB party, which had won the general elections, obtained an additional seat.\n50: On 4 March 2010 the DPS and three of its deputies in the National Assembly in turn lodged the appeal provided for in section 112 of the Electoral Law and contested the lawfulness of the election of the three deputies which the Central Electoral Commission had declared elected by decision of 19 February 2010. Mr Riza lodged the same appeal in his own name.\n51: On 31 March and 27 April 2010 the Constitutional Court declared the two appeals inadmissible on the grounds that the dispute in issue had already been the subject of proceedings before it, leading to its judgment of 16 February 2010.\n52: The 41st National Assembly constituted following the general elections of 5 July 2009 sat until 15 March 2013, when it was dissolved by Presidential Decree.\n53: The elections to the 42nd National Assembly were held on 12 May 2013. At those elections the DPS obtained 400,460 votes, that is to say 11.31% of the validly cast votes. It obtained 51,784 votes in Turkish territory. It sent 36 deputies to the National Assembly, where it was the third biggest parliamentary group. Mr Riza was elected deputy of the 8th multiple-member constituency, where he headed his party’s list.\n54: The lawfulness of those general elections, particularly as regards the polling stations opened in Turkish territory, was disputed before the Constitutional Court by a group of 48 deputies from the GERB party. The deputies requested the annulment of the elections in the 86 polling stations operating in Turkey owing to several alleged irregularities in the voting procedures: they submitted that the polling stations had been set up on the basis of forged prior declarations of intention to vote; they had opened despite their electoral committees lacking the minimum number of members; unidentified persons had canvassed the areas inhabited by Bulgarian citizens in Turkey, had obtained Bulgarian identity papers from various electors and had returned them to their owners the day before the elections telling them that they had voted; several voters had not shown any valid Bulgarian identity papers; the number of persons voting in some of the polling stations had exceeded, which was unrealistic in view of the time required to complete the formalities linked to the voting procedure; there had been several cases of double voting; the lists of electors registered on election day had not been properly drawn up and had not been signed by the chair and the other members of the electoral committee. The request referred explicitly to the reasoning of the judgment delivered by the Constitutional Court on 16 February 2010.\n55: By judgment of 28 November 2013 the Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal lodged by the 48 GERB deputies. It considered and rejected, on the basis of the evidence gathered, all the allegations of breaches of electoral legislation advanced by the appellants. It noted, inter alia, that the relevant members of all the electoral committees set up in Turkish territory had signed at the bottom of the lists of voters added on election day, which gave those documents the probative value of official documents.\n56: During the 42nd legislature the DPS took part in a coalition government which resigned in July 2014. Following those events the 42nd National Assembly was dissolved on 6 August 2014 by Presidential Decree.\n57: The elections to the 43rd National Assembly were held on 5 October 2014. The DPS obtained 487,134 votes, that is to say 14.84% of all valid votes cast, and sent 38 deputies to Parliament. No admissible appeal was lodged before the Constitutional Court against those election results. The DPS is currently the third biggest political party in the country and the second biggest opposition party.\n58: Mr Riza was elected as deputy in the 8th constituency, where he headed the DPS list.\n91: At its 51st and 52nd sessions on 5 and 6 July and 18 and 19 October 2002, the Commission European for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) adopted its guidelines in electoral matters and an explanatory report on those guidelines. These two documents together constitute the Venice Commission’s Code of Good Conduct in Electoral Matters, which was approved by the Parliamentary Assemblée and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe in 2003.\n92: The relevant parts of the Code read as follows:\n93: There are two possible solutions:\n94: Appeal to parliament, as the judge of its own election, is sometimes provided for but could result in political decisions. It is acceptable as a first instance in places where it is long established, but a judicial appeal should then be possible.\n95: Appeal proceedings should be as brief as possible, in any case concerning decisions to be taken before the election. On this point, two pitfalls must be avoided: first, that appeal proceedings retard the electoral process, and second, that, due to their lack of suspensive effect, decisions on appeals which could have been taken before, are taken after the elections. In addition, decisions on the results of elections must also not take too long, especially where the political climate is tense. This means both that the time limits for appeals must be very short and that the appeal body must make its ruling as quickly as possible. Time limits must, however, be long enough to make an appeal possible, to guarantee the exercise of rights of defence and a reflected decision. A time limit of three to five days at first instance (both for lodging appeals and making rulings) seems reasonable for decisions to be taken before the elections. It is, however, permissible to grant a little more time to Supreme and Constitutional Courts for their rulings.\n96: The procedure must also be simple, and providing voters with special appeal forms helps to make it so. It is necessary to eliminate formalism, and so avoid decisions of inadmissibility, especially in politically sensitive cases.\n97: It is also vital that the appeal procedure, and especially the powers and responsibilities of the various bodies involved in it, should be clearly regulated by law, so as to avoid any positive or negative conflicts of jurisdiction. Neither the appellants nor the authorities should be able to choose the appeal body. The risk that successive bodies will refuse to give a decision is seriously increased where it is theoretically possible to appeal to either the courts or an electoral commission, or where the powers of different courts – e.g. the ordinary courts and the constitutional court – are not clearly differentiated. ...\n98: Disputes relating to the electoral registers, which are the responsibility, for example, of the local administration operating under the supervision of or in co-operation with the electoral commissions, can be dealt with by courts of first instance.\n99: Standing in such appeals must be granted as widely as possible. It must be open to every elector in the constituency and to every candidate standing for election there to lodge an appeal. A reasonable quorum may, however, be imposed for appeals by voters on the results of elections.\n100: The appeal procedure should be of a judicial nature, in the sense that the right of the appellants to proceedings in which both parties are heard should be safeguarded.\n101: The powers of appeal bodies are important too. They should have authority to annul elections, if irregularities may have influenced the outcome, i.e. affected the distribution of seats. This is the general principle, but it should be open to adjustment, i.e. annulment should not necessarily affect the whole country or constituency – indeed, it should be possible to annul the results of just one polling station. This makes it possible to avoid the two extremes – annulling an entire election, although irregularities affect a small area only, and refusing to annul, because the area affected is too small. In zones where the results have been annulled, the elections must be repeated.\n102: Where higher-level commissions are appeal bodies, they should be able to rectify or annul ex officio the decisions of lower electoral commissions.”\n109: The Government contested the victim status of Mr Riza, the DPS and the other 101 applicants.\n110: They submitted in particular that Mr Riza had stood in the 2009 general elections as a party candidate in a multiple-member constituency in Bulgarian territory where parliamentary seats had been allocated according to the proportional system. Bulgarian voters living abroad, particularly in Turkey, had voted not for lists of candidates put forward by the political parties but for the parties themselves. Thus electors who had voted for the DPS in the polling stations in question had not voted explicitly for Mr Riza. Accordingly, the latter could not have validly claimed that the decision which had led to the annulment of the votes cast for his party in 23 polling stations in Turkey had had a direct negative impact on his right to stand in the general elections.\n111: The Government added that the DPS also could not claim to have been the victim of a violation of its right to stand in elections, since it had taken part in the election under the same conditions as all the other parties and coalitions. By actively participating in the country’s political life and the elections, the party had implicitly agreed to obey the rules on the apportionment of seats and not to take advantage of any irregularities occurring during the voting procedure. The impugned judgment of the Constitutional Court had noted and remedied just such irregularities, and that decision had led to the annulment of the election of candidates from other political parties. Thus the impugned measure had not been aimed exclusively at the DPS and had not been implemented disproportionately and tendentiously.\n112: As regards the other 101 applicants who voted in polling stations where the results were annulled by the Constitutional Court, the Government submitted that their voting rights had in no way been infringed. They pointed out in particular that the State had made the necessary arrangements to enable those concerned to cast their votes in their country of residence. The applicants’ votes had not been declared null and void by the Constitutional Court’s judgment: the latter had been delivered in the framework of proceedings which had provided all the necessary safeguards against arbitrariness, and had merely deducted from the final outcome of the elections all the votes cast in the polling stations where the 101 applicants had voted on grounds of non-compliance with the legal obligation for the leaders of electoral committees to sign the additional lists of voters. Accordingly, the Constitutional Court’s judgment had not directly or sufficiently seriously infringed those applicants’ active electoral rights.\n113: Relying on the same arguments, the Government submitted, in the alternative, that the application lodged by the 101 electors should be rejected as being incompatible ratione materiae, manifestly ill-founded, and/or, pursuant to Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention, for lack of significant disadvantage.\n114: The Court notes that all those objections can be summed up in a single plea disputing the applicants’ victim status. It considers that that question is closely connected with the very substance of the complaints raised by the applicants under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. It therefore holds that that objection should be joined to the merits of the complaints submitted by Mr Riza, the DPS and the other 101 applicants.\n116: The applicants alleged that the judgment delivered by the Constitutional Court on 16 February 2010 had given rise to an unjustified infringement of their rights as secured under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n117: Mr Riza submitted that he had stood in the 2009 general elections as a candidate on the DPS list in the 8th multiple-member constituency in Dobrich. Following the elections he had been declared elected to the National Assembly, and his party, the DPS, had been represented by 38 deputies in the national Parliament, 33 of whom had benefited from the proportional allocation of seats. The impugned judgment of the Constitutional Court had subsequently modified the election results: the DPS’s total was reduced by 18,140 votes, which had led to the loss of one of its seats, Mr Riza’s, in the national Parliament. Mr Riza and the DPS considered that that situation amounted to an interference with the exercise of their right to stand in general elections.\n118: The other 101 applicants had exercised their voting rights during the Bulgarian general elections. They had chosen to vote in 17 of the polling stations opened in Turkish territory. The Bulgarian Constitutional Court had, by its judgment of 16 February 2010, annulled the voting in 23 of the polling stations in Turkish territory, including those in which the applicants had voted. Their votes had thus been annulled. The 101 applicants considered that that situation amounted to an interference with the exercise of their right to participate as voters in the general election.\n119: The applicants submitted that the decision-making process which had led to the modification of the election result had lacked adequate safeguards against arbitrariness. The procedure used by the Constitutional Court to reach its decision had been designed for assessing the constitutionality of legislation enacted by Parliament: the procedure had been completely unsuited to the assessment of an electoral dispute and, moreover, the regulations governing it had been defective. In the instant case, the precise subject matter of the dispute had not been determined from the outset of the proceedings, having only been established when the Constitutional Court had delivered judgment. The fact that the Constitutional Court had rejected all the appellants’ arguments put forward one by one, but decided to annul the voting in in 23 polling stations because of formal defects which had been mentioned for the first time in the proceedings by an expert report, at the initiative of the experts in question, revealed a lack of clarity and foreseeability in that regard. The appellants had thus been exempted from the obligation to present evidence of the irregularities allegedly committed in the polling stations in question. The Constitutional Court had appropriated the power to investigate and to adjudicate ex officio on compliance with the overall criteria governing the fairness of voting in all the polling stations in which the Bulgarian citizens living in Turkey had voted.\n120: The proceedings before the Constitutional Court had not been adversarial. Neither the DPS nor Mr Riza had been parties to the proceedings in spite of their express requests to that effect and despite the fact that, in their view, the dispute had concerned them directly. The only document in the case file to which they had had access was the initial statement of claim, which had been transmitted to them by the DPS deputies in the National Assembly. Those applicants had had no access to the other contents of the case-file, the additional arguments set forth by the appellants, the evidence gathered during the proceedings or the factual and legal issues discussed before the Constitutional Court. They had been deprived of any opportunity to defend their rights and legitimate interests in the framework of the proceedings. Furthermore, domestic law provided no remedy against the impugned judgment of the Constitutional Court.\n121: The DPS, Mr Riza and the other 101 applicants submitted that the irregularities in the voting procedure noted in the judgment of the Constitutional Court had been minimal and should not have led to the annulment of the votes cast in the polling stations in question or of the voting procedure itself. The Constitutional Court had failed to consider whether the impact of the irregularities noted had been sufficiently serious to require the annulment of the voting in the 23 polling stations.\n122: The applicants considered that none of those irregularities had pointed to any kind of electoral fraud. The Electoral Law did not require the chair and the secretary of the local electoral committee responsible for an out-of-country polling station to sign at the bottom of the list of voters registered on election day. Such a requirement applied to the “additional lists” drawn up solely in polling stations in the national territory. That was why almost all the lists of voters drawn up on election day in the polling stations in Turkey had not been signed. Moreover, the same requirement had not been complied with in polling stations in the national territory, although, according to the applicants, that had not affected the validity of the voting procedure in those stations. That being the case, the Constitutional Court’s affirmation that the signatures in question were a fundamental and obvious element for the validity of the voting lists had been completely arbitrary.\n123: The applicants submitted that the electoral documents required for calculating out-of-country electoral results were the minutes of voting signed by the members of the local electoral committee and the diplomatic telegram sent by the Bulgarian representations in the country concerned. They explained that those two documents contained information on the number of persons voting, the number of spoiled votes and the number of votes cast for each party. Enclosed with the list of voters comprising identification data on and the signature of each person voting, as well as the ballot papers in the ballot box, those documents had been sufficient to detect any instance of electoral fraud. All those documents had been available for the 23 polling stations and no electoral fraud had been discovered.\n124: The applicants added that the Constitutional Court had noted two further irregularities: the absence of minutes or of the first page of such minutes. In fact it was not the first but the second page of the minutes which provided the information required to calculate the results, that is to say the number of persons voting, the number of valid ballots, the number of spoiled votes, and the apportionment of votes among the different political parties. In the event that neither of the two pages of the minutes had been placed on file, the diplomatic telegram reproduced the same data. Those documents had indeed been filed away in respect of the 23 polling stations in question.\n125: The Constitutional Court had itself acknowledged that the votes cast in the 23 polling stations had been valid, but had decided to deduct them from the election results owing to omissions which had been attributable neither to the voters, including the 101 applicants in the present case, nor to Mr Riza and the DPS. Furthermore, the media had reported many cases of similar omissions, such as the accidental destruction by maintenance staff at the Bulgarian Embassy in Washington of all the electoral documents from the polling stations operating in US territory. The lawfulness of the voting procedure in US territory had never been challenged, and the votes cast in those polling stations had been taken into account for the apportionment of seats in the National Assembly.\n126: For those reasons, the applicants invited the Court to find that the impugned interference with the exercise of their respective rights to participate in the general elections as candidates/voters had not pursued any legitimate aim and had been totally unjustified under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n127: The Government first of all disputed the existence of an interference with the exercise by the applicants of the rights secured under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n128: They pointed out that the DPS had put up numerous candidates for the 2009 general elections in single- and multiple-member constituencies, and that Mr Riza had been included in that party’s list of candidates for the 8th multiple-member constituency. They denied that there had been any direct link between the annulment of the voting in the 23 polling stations in Turkish territory and the annulment of Mr Riza’s parliamentary seat. The Government considered that that decision had not affected the DPS’s political weighting, since it was still the third biggest political party in Bulgaria in terms of number of deputies elected to the National Assembly.\n129: As regards the other 101 applicants, the Government considered that they had exercised their voting rights and that their votes had not been annulled by the Constitutional Court. On the contrary, the Constitutional Court had emphasised that those votes had been valid but had nonetheless not been counted owing to serious negligence on the part of the members of the electoral committees responsible for the polling stations in which the applicants had voted.\n130: In the alternative, the Government submitted that even supposing there had been an interference with Mr Riza’s and the DPS’s passive electoral rights and with the other applicants’ active electoral rights, that interference had been justified in the light of the arguments set out below.\n131: The Government thus explained that the right to vote and the right to stand for election were guaranteed by the Bulgarian Constitution and that at the material time the voting procedure had been governed by the 2001 Electoral Law. Seats in the National Assembly had been allocated on the basis of all valid votes cast. That being the case, it had been vital for the lawfulness of the election to take into account only the valid votes in calculating the election results. In the Government’s view, that had been the only way to guarantee the protection of both the right to vote and the right to stand for election, inasmuch as it had ensured that deputies were elected to the national Parliament with the genuine support of the electorate.\n132: The Government added that the domestic courts had applied Bulgarian electoral legislation in a clear and foreseeable manner. They stated that the judgment of the Constitutional Court disputed by the applicants had been geared to ensuring compliance both with electoral legislation and with the lawfulness of the election.\n133: The Government further pointed out that according to the Electoral Law the Constitutional Court was the body competent to examine the lawfulness of the election of deputies. In the framework of its competences and pursuant to the above-mentioned legitimate aims, the Constitutional Court had conducted very careful scrutiny of the conditions for ensuring the regularity of voting in the polling stations operating in Turkish territory. It had ordered two expert assessments and examined their findings, and had received and taken into account the observations of all the parties concerned. Referring to the overall evidence amassed, it had noted serious omissions from the election material, particularly the lists of voters and the minutes of voting, which it submitted had affected the lawfulness of the voting procedure and necessitated the exclusion of the votes cast in 23 polling stations, including the 17 stations in which the 101 applicants in the present case had voted. The modification of the election results had led to a redistribution of parliamentary seats and the annulment of the seats of three deputies belonging to different political formations, that is to say the DPS, the RZS party and the Blue Coalition. The impact of the modification of the election results had thus been apportioned among several parties taking part in the general elections, and neither the DPS nor Mr Riza could validly claim that the impugned judgment had had the effect of exclusively infringing their rights and legitimate interests.\n134: The Government submitted that there had been no sign of arbitrariness in the manner in which the judgment in question had been adopted and reasoned. The Constitutional Court had merely applied domestic electoral legislation. The alleged interference with the exercise of the rights to vote and to stand for election had not violated the substance of those rights; it had pursued a legitimate aim and observed a proper proportionality between the general interest and the applicants’ rights.\n135: The Government added that the Bulgarian authorities were determined to fight electoral practices that were incompatible with democracy, making them liable to criminal prosecution. Those practices included vote-buying and “electoral tourism”, which consisted in organising transport out of the country for a large number of voters in order to skew the election results.\n136: The Court reiterates that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 enshrines a characteristic principle of democracy and is accordingly of prime importance in the Convention system (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 2 March 1987, § 47, Series A no. 113, and Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, § 103, ECHR 2006IV). The role of the State, as ultimate guarantor of pluralism, involves adopting positive measures to “organise” democratic elections “under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 54).\n137: Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 does not create any obligation to introduce a specific system such as proportional representation or majority voting with one or two ballots. The Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation in that sphere. Electoral systems seek to fulfil objectives which are sometimes scarcely compatible with each other: on the one hand, to fairly accurately reflect the opinions of the people, and on the other, to channel currents of thought so as to promote the emergence of a sufficiently clear and coherent political will. In these circumstances the phrase “conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” implies essentially the principle of equality of treatment of all citizens in the exercise of their right to vote and their right to stand for election. It does not follow, however, that all votes must necessarily have equal weight as regards the outcome of the election or that all candidates must have equal chances of victory. Thus no electoral system can eliminate “wasted votes” (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 54).\n138: According to the case-law of the Court, the words “free expression of the opinion of the people” mean that elections cannot be conducted under any form of pressure in the choice of one or more candidates, and that in this choice the elector must not be unduly induced to vote for one party or another. The word “choice” means that the different political parties must be ensured a reasonable opportunity to present their candidates at elections (see Yumak and Sadak v. Turkey [GC], no. 10226/03, § 108, ECHR 2008). The Court has also ruled that once the wishes of the people have been freely and democratically expressed, no subsequent amendment to the organisation of the electoral system may call that choice into question, except in the presence of compelling grounds for the democratic order (see Lykourezos v. Greece, no. 33554/03, § 52, ECHR 2006VIII).\n139: Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 also covers subjective rights, including the right to vote and the right to stand for election (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, §§ 46-51).\n140: The right to vote, that is to say the “active” aspect of the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, is not a privilege. In the twenty-first century, the presumption in a democratic State must be in favour of inclusion (see Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, § 59, ECHR 2005IX). Clearly, Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 does not provide for the implementation by Contracting States of measures to allow expatriates to exercise their right to vote from their place of residence. Nevertheless, since the presumption in a democratic State must be in favour of inclusion, such measures are consonant with that provision (see Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos v. Greece [GC], no. 42202/07, § 71, ECHR 2012).\n141: As regards the passive aspect of electoral rights, it is not restricted to the mere possibility of standing for election: once elected, the person concerned is also entitled to sit as a member of parliament (see Sadak and Others v. Turkey (no. 2), nos. 25144/94, 26149/95 to 26154/95, 27100/95 and 27101/95, § 33, ECHR 2002IV, and Lykourezos, cited above, § 50 in fine). Moreover, the Court has accepted that, when electoral legislation or the measures taken by national authorities restrict individual candidates’ right to stand for election through a party list, the relevant party, as a corporate entity, could claim to be a victim under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 independently of its candidates (see Georgian Labour Party v. Georgia, no. 9103/04, §§ 72-74, ECHR 2008).\n142: The Court then reiterates that the rights secured under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are not absolute. There is room for “implied limitations”, and Contracting States must be given a margin of appreciation in this sphere (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 52; Ždanoka, cited above, § 103; and Podkolzina v. Latvia, no. 46726/99, § 33, ECHR 2002-II). However, it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 52, and Ždanoka, cited above, § 104).\n143: The Court must ensure that the decision-making process on ineligibility or contestation of election results is accompanied by criteria framed to prevent arbitrary decisions. In particular, such a finding must be reached by a body which can provide a minimum of guarantees of its impartiality. Similarly, the discretion enjoyed by the body concerned must not be exorbitantly wide; it must be circumscribed, with sufficient precision, by the provisions of domestic law. Lastly, the procedure for declaring a candidate ineligible must be such as to ensure a fair and objective decision and prevent any abuse of power on the part of the relevant authority (see Podkolzina, cited above, § 35; Kovach v. Ukraine, no. 39424/02, §§ 54-55, ECHR 2008; and Kerimova, cited above, §§ 44-45). The Court also reiterates that under the subsidiarity principle it is not its task to replace the domestic courts in assessing the facts or interpreting domestic law. In the specific context of electoral disputes, it is not called up to determine whether the irregularities in the voting procedure complained of by the parties amounted to violations of the relevant domestic legislation (see Namat Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 18705/06, § 77, 8 April 2010). Its role in determining whether there was an unjustified interference in “the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” is confined to establishing whether the decision given by the domestic court was arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see Babenko v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 43476/98, 4 May 1999; Partija “Jaunie Demokrati” and Partija “Musu Zeme” v. Latvia (dec.), nos. 10547/07 and 34049/07, 29 November 2007; and Kerimli and Alibeyli, cited above, §§ 38-42).\n144: The Court considers that it should first of all seek to establish whether the situation complained of by the applicants amounts to an interference with their rights as guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n145: The Court observes that at the material time the 101 applicants, whose names are appended to the present judgment, lived in Turkey. They voted in the 5 July 2009 general elections in 17 of the polling stations in Turkish territory. Their votes were initially taken into account in calculating the 4% electoral threshold. The votes cast by the applicants for the six successful parties were then taken into account in apportioning seats among those political parties at the national level ....\n146: In its judgment of 16 February 2010, which is the subject of the present application, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court decided to annul the elections in 23 polling stations opened by the Bulgarian diplomatic representations in Turkish territory and to deduct from the election results the votes cast in those polling stations, to a total of 18,358 votes. Those votes included those cast by the 101 applicants whose names are appended, as the 17 polling stations in which they had voted had been among the 23 in which the elections were annulled.\n147: The Government submitted that the situation in question did not amount to an interference with the exercise of the 101 applicants’ voting rights: they argued that the latter had exercised their right to vote, but that their votes had not been counted in the allocation of seats in the National Assembly because there had had been serious irregularities in the voting procedure in their polling stations. The Court begs to differ.\n148: The active electoral right as guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is not confined exclusively to the acts of choosing one’s favourite candidates in the secrecy of the polling booth and slipping one’s ballot paper into the box. It also involves each voter being able to see his or her vote influencing the make-up of the legislature, subject to compliance with the rules laid down in electoral legislation. To allow the contrary would be tantamount to rendering the right to vote, the election and ultimately the democratic system itself meaningless.\n149: Those considerations lead the Court to note that the impugned judgment of the Constitutional Court did have a direct impact on the voting rights of the 101 applicants in question. Their votes were excluded from the election results: they were not taken into account in calculating the 4% electoral threshold, and those of the 101 votes which were cast for the first six parties in the elections were not taken into account in apportioning seats among those parties at the national level ....\n150: The Court observes that Mr Riza and the DPS stood in the 5 July 2009 Bulgarian general elections: the DPS was registered by the Central Electoral Commission as a party participating in the election, put up several candidates in the multiple- and single-member constituencies in Bulgarian territory and was included on the ballot paper specially designed for voting outside the national territory; Mr Riza was in second place on his party’s list of candidates in the 8th multiple-member constituency in Dobrich (see paragraph 14 above). After the initial publication of the election results and the first allocation of seats on 7 July 2009, the DPS obtained 33 seats in the National Assembly under the proportional system, and five further seats under the majority system (see paragraph 20 above). Mr Riza was not elected to Parliament (see paragraph 21 above). However, following a Constitutional Court appeal lodged by a candidate for another political party, which was ultimately successful, a second proportional distribution of seats was organised: the DPS lost one of its two seats in the 19th multiple-member constituency but obtained a second seat in the 8th multiple-member constituency, which was assigned to Mr Riza as the second candidate on his party’s list in that constituency (ibid.). Accordingly, as at 12 October 2009 the DPS’s score in the elections totalled 610,521 votes and the party had 38 deputies in Parliament, including Mr Riza. The latter was subsequently elected to one of the standing committees in the National Assembly.\n151: The Constitutional Court judgment affected the situation of those two applicants, who had stood for the general election in question. The DPS had 18,140 votes deducted from its total electoral score. The ensuing redistribution of seats led to changes in the composition of the national Parliament: the DPS lost one parliamentary seat to the political party which had won the elections under the proportional system, and Mr Riza lost his mandate as a deputy (see paragraphs 48 and 49 above). Thus the applicant party’s electoral score under the proportional system fell by some 3%; its parliamentary group was reduced from 38 deputies to 37, and Mr Riza forfeited his position as a representative in the National Assembly.\n152: In the light of the above facts, the Court considers that the situation complained of by the applicants amounts to an interference with the exercise of their respective rights to vote in and stand for general elections as secured under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. It also considers that the same arguments require it to reject the Government’s objection regarding the applicants’ lack of victim status (see paragraph 114 above).\n153: The Court must therefore satisfy itself that the interference in question did not limit the applicants’ active and passive electoral rights to the extent of affecting their very substance and depriving them of their effectiveness, that it pursued a legitimate aim and that the means used were not disproportionate to the aim pursued.\n154: The Court notes that the parties disagree as to the purpose of the impugned measures. The applicants considered that the annulment of the voting in 23 out-of-country polling stations had not pursued any legitimate aim, whereas the Government submitted that the scrutiny conducted by the Constitutional Court had been geared to ensuring compliance with electoral legislation.\n155: The Court observes that the proceedings before the Constitutional Court which led to the judgment complained of by the applicants were based on Article 149, (1) (7) of the Constitution and section 112 of the 2001 Electoral Law. Those provisions allowed any person standing in the general elections to contest the lawfulness of the election of deputies to the National Assembly .... Such disputes often concern compliance with the rules on voting and vote-counting in one or more polling stations, and may lead to the invalidation of some of the votes and a change in the total number of votes obtained by each individual candidate or political party. In proportional election systems, changing the electoral score of political formations, sometimes just in one single polling station, can lead to a redistribution of parliamentary seats and an increase or decrease in the number of seats allocated to the various parties or coalitions. That is exactly what happened in the present case. The impugned proceedings were brought by the President of the RZS political party and three of its candidates, seeking to contest the lawfulness of the election of seven DPS deputies under the proportional system in the framework of the Bulgarian election system. The appellants complained of several irregularities in the voting procedure in the 123 polling stations in which Bulgarian citizens living in Turkey had exercised their voting rights (see paragraph 22 above). Accordingly, the Court accepts that the proceedings before the Constitutional Court had the legitimate aim of ensuring compliance with electoral legislation and therefore the lawfulness of the voting and the election results.\n156: The Court considers that the next step must be to establish whether the decision-making process was surrounded by adequate safeguards against arbitrariness. In doing so it must ascertain whether that process complied with the requirements as set out in its well-established case-law (see paragraph 143 above).\n157: The applicants submitted that the proceedings before the Constitutional Court had been unsuited to the assessment of post-electoral disputes. They observed that the application of the procedural rules laid down in the Law on the Constitutional Court and its implementing regulations had resulted in a set of proceedings that had lacked any clearly determined purpose, remained inaccessible to the DPS and Mr Riza and been unappealable (see paragraphs 119 and 120 above). The Government considered that the two applicants had been involved in the proceedings to the extent required in order to defend their interests, as the Constitutional Court had considered their observations and replied to them in its judgment of 16 February 2010 (see paragraph 133 above).\n158: The Court observes from the outset that the applicant party disputed neither the independence nor the impartiality of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court dealing with the post-electoral case in question. It sees no reason to reach any different conclusion on that matter.\n159: The Court then notes that the Law on the Bulgarian Constitutional Court and its implementing regulations only provide for one type of proceedings for all cases submitted to it. The same procedural rules are therefore applicable to cases concerning the compatibility with the Constitution of domestic legislative provisions and to disputes concerning the lawfulness of general elections and election results. In the present case it is not the Court’s task to adjudicate in abstracto on the compatibility with the Convention and its Protocols of the legislature’s approach. It will confine itself to assessing whether, in the instant case, the proceedings in issue allowed the applicants to defend their legitimate interests effectively, as persons or parties participating in general elections.\n160: In the initial complaint on which the impugned proceedings were based, the leader of the RZS political party and three of its members contested the lawfulness of the election of seven DPS deputies, alleging serious violations of electoral legislation in all the polling stations operating in Turkish territory (see paragraph 22 above). The proceedings led to the annulment of the elections in 23 of the 123 polling stations in question and to the cancellation of Mr Riza’s parliamentary mandate, which had not been included in the initial complaint. The Court observes that that situation is the result of the combined effect of three specific aspects of the Bulgarian electoral system: the allocation under proportional representation at the national level of 209 parliamentary seats among the different political parties; the consideration of out-of-country votes solely for that allocation of seats at the national level; and the subsequent allocation of seats won by each party in the 31 multiple-member constituencies in Bulgaria. Having regard to those specific features of the Bulgarian electoral system, the decisions whether to annul one or more parliamentary mandates and which mandates to annul depended on the number of votes invalidated and their apportionment among the different parties. The Constitutional Court therefore had first of all to establish whether the voting procedure had been sufficiently seriously flawed to require the annulment of the results of voting. The Constitutional Court chose to limit the territorial scope of its assessment of observance of electoral legislation to the polling stations specially opened in Turkish territory because those stations had been explicitly mentioned in the initial complaint submitted to it. The Court will not question the domestic court’s choice in this respect.\n161: All the parties’ observations and the expert reports presented to the Constitutional Court concerned the question whether there had been irregularities in the voting procedure in the polling stations in Turkey, and if so, whether those irregularities had been sufficiently serious to justify annulling the results (see paragraphs 22 and 25-37 above). The reasoning set out by the Bulgarian Constitutional Court in its judgment of 16 February 2010 had been based on the same questions (see paragraphs 38-48 above). The Court considers that all these elements show that the subject matter of the dispute before the Constitutional Court, that is to say the alleged irregularity of the voting procedure in all the polling stations operating in Turkish territory, was known to all those taking part in the proceedings right from the outset.\n162: The wording of section 112 of the 2001 Electoral Law suggested that a dispute concerning the alleged unlawfulness of the election of a deputy necessarily involved the latter and the natural or legal persons disputing his or her election .... The applicant party relied on that provision to argue that the DPS and Mr Riza had been parties to the proceedings right from the outset, and at the very least since their explicit request to join the proceedings on 15 and 16 February 2010. However, it cannot be overlooked that Rule 21 (1) of the Rules of the Constitutional Court confers on it the discretionary power to determine the parties involved in proceedings before it .... It was in the framework of that power that the Constitutional Court designated a number of State institutions and bodies and two non-governmental organisations as parties to the proceedings (see paragraph 24 above).\n163: It is true that the Constitutional Court did not reply to the request submitted by Mr Riza and the DPS to be joined as parties to the proceedings. On the other hand, the National Assembly joined as a party to the proceedings on 11 August 2009 (see paragraph 24 above). The Court will not question the Constitutional Court’s choice in this regard. Owing to the specific features of the Bulgarian electoral system ... it was impossible to foresee which party or individual candidate would be affected by the final decision. In that framework, designating the National Assembly as a party to the proceedings before the Constitutional Court seemed logical because all the deputies were potentially concerned by the future judgment of that court and all the political parties which had participated in the allocation of seats under the proportional system were represented in the Assembly.\n164: On the date on which Parliament was officially designated as a party to the proceedings, the DPS had a parliamentary group comprising 38 deputies. Mr Riza, who is a Vice-President of the party, joined the ranks of his parliamentary group in October 2009 (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). The two applicants acknowledged that it was through the intermediary of the parliamentary group that Mr Riza and the party organs had obtained a copy of the initial statement of claim (see paragraph 120 above). The Court notes that the DPS parliamentary group played a much more active role in the impugned proceedings before the Constitutional Court than the applicants would admit. Through the intermediary of the national Parliament the DPS parliamentary group presented observations on both the admissibility and the merits of the case, in which it countered the arguments set out in the appellants’ complaint (see paragraph 25 above). The Constitutional Court replied to those observations in its judgment of 16 February 2010 (see paragraphs 39-48 above). The DPS parliamentary group also pronounced on the additional expert assessment ordered by the Constitutional Court on 27 January 2010, contesting the criteria used in order to deduct from the election results the votes cast in the 23 polling stations in Turkey (see paragraph 34 above). Those criteria subsequently proved decisive for the outcome of the proceedings (see paragraphs 46-48 above).\n165: In the light of all the above factors, the Court notes that during the proceedings before the Constitutional Court the DPS parliamentary group actively defended the interests of its political party and those of Mr Riza, who was a party member. Moreover, it would appear that through the intermediary of the national Parliament, which was officially a party to the proceedings, the parliamentary group, and therefore the two applicants, had access to all the documents in the case file and were regularly updated on the progress of the proceedings (see, in particular, the content of their individual requests for leave to join the proceedings as parties in paragraph 37 above). Having regard to the circumstances of the case and notwithstanding that the two applicants were not officially parties to the impugned proceedings, the Court considers that they did actually participate in the proceedings through the intermediary of the DPS parliamentary group and that they had an opportunity to set forth their arguments against the annulment of the election results in the polling stations in Turkish territory and to contest effectively the arguments presented by the appellants.\n166: The DPS and Mr Riza also complained that no appeal had lain against the Constitutional Court’s judgment. The Court observes in that regard that none of the provisions of the Convention or the Protocols thereto require Contracting States to put in place an appeal system for electoral disputes, let alone provide for an appeal against Constitutional Court judgments, where States opt for assigning the adjudication of post-electoral disputes to such superior courts. It should also be noted that in its Code of Good Conduct in Electoral Matters, the Venice Commission recommends introducing the possibility of appealing to a tribunal solely where the first-instance decisions have been given by specialised bodies such as electoral committees (see paragraph 92 above).\n167: All the applicants contested the reasons on which the Constitutional Court had based its decision to annul the voting in 23 polling stations. The Court reiterates that it is not its task to replace the domestic courts in assessing the facts or interpreting domestic law, in this case the Bulgarian Electoral Law. It must, however, satisfy itself that the decision given by the domestic court was not arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see paragraph 143 above).\n168: The Court observes that the Bulgarian Constitutional Court noted the following irregularities in the electoral documents in order to justify the annulment of the voting in the 23 polling stations in question: the failure to put on file the minutes of voting in one polling station; no first page for the minutes of voting or no information on the first page concerning the number of persons voting; and failure of the chair and secretary of the local electoral commission to sign at the bottom of the list of voters registered on election day (see paragraph 46 above). The Bulgarian Constitutional Court accepted that the minutes of voting constituted the main document establishing the facts concerning voting in a given polling station, and that the absence of the first page of that document and the signatures at the bottom of the additional list of voters affected its probative value vis-à-vis the reality of the voting in the polling station in question (see paragraphs 46 and 47 above).\n169: The Court notes that the minutes of voting as defined by Bulgarian legislation plays a dual role in the voting process: the second page of the minutes sets out the results of the voting, and it is on the basis of those data that the Central Electoral Commission determines the election results ...; the first page of the minutes also contains the number of persons registered on the electoral roll and the number of those who actually voted on election day ... and thus serves as a basis for comparison with the electoral rolls in detecting various types of electoral fraud, such as ballot-box stuffing and the inclusion of fictitious voters on the lists of persons voting. In the present case, there were no minutes on file for just one of the polling stations in Turkish territory; as regards the other three, the first page of the minutes was missing; and in respect of another polling station the minutes failed to record the number of persons who had voted on election day (see paragraph 33 above).\n170: The Court observes that it was only in the last of those five polling stations that the irregularity concerning the minutes was, in all likelihood, committed on election day by the members of the local electoral commission and that that irregularity can therefore be considered as circumstantial evidence of electoral fraud. Given that the electoral documents from out-of-country polling stations had first of all been handed over to the Bulgarian diplomatic representatives at the close of voting on election day and only then been sent on to the Central Electoral Commission in Bulgaria ..., it cannot be ruled out that the minutes from the first of those polling stations and the first page of the minutes from the other three had gone missing at that stage. The Constitutional Court failed to look into that possibility, despite the reports from some of the members of the Central Electoral Commission that the electoral documents from Turkey had previously been opened and then resealed before being sent to the Commission (see paragraph 36 above).\n171: Without seeking to establish whether the minutes from those four polling stations had in fact been completed, signed and handed over in their entirety to the Bulgarian diplomatic services in Turkey by the corresponding local electoral commissions, the Constitutional Court merely noted their total or partial absence from the files of the competent State bodies, which automatically led to the annulment of the voting in those four polling stations. The Constitutional Court thus based that part of its decision on a factual finding which did not in itself demonstrate that there had been any kind of irregularity in the voting procedure in the four polling stations.\n172: The Constitutional Court decided to annul the elections in another 18 polling stations on the grounds that the lists of voters registered on the day of the elections had been signed neither by the chair nor the secretary of the local electoral commission. Its judgment acknowledged that the Electoral Law did not explicitly require such signatures. It nonetheless considered that such signature was one of the fundamental and obvious components of any official document and that the model “additional list of voters” approved by Presidential Decree provided for such signatures (see paragraph 47 above). The Constitutional Court thus applied by analogy the provisions on “additional lists of voters” and “under-the-line lists” drawn up in the polling stations in Bulgarian national territory ... to the specific case of the lists of non-preregistered voters drawn up on election day in the out-of-country polling stations. It annulled the voting in the 18 polling stations on the grounds that the irregularities noted in the voting lists had irremediably affected the probative value of the minutes of voting.\n173: It transpires from the case file that all the electoral documents from those 18 polling stations (ballot-papers, minutes and electoral lists) had been filed and placed at the disposal of the experts and the members of the Constitutional Court. The Court observes that the lack of the two signatures is the only irregularity that was found in those electoral documents. Moreover, the Constitutional Court acknowledged in its judgment that the absence of the signatures of the local electoral commission officials only cast doubt on the probative value of the lists of voters and consequently the accuracy of the data set out in the minutes of voting, and not the validity of the votes cast.\n174: Clearly, non-compliance with the formal requirements concerning electoral lists may point to fraud relating to the composition of the electorate. However, the Court considers that that was not necessarily the case in the specific context of the present case. It cannot be overlooked that at the material time there were omissions in the Bulgarian electoral legislation concerning the formalities to be observed by out-of-country local electoral commissions when registering voters on the electoral lists on election day. The Constitutional Court came up against that problem in the present case, and it resorted to application by analogy of the Electoral Law in order to fill the legal vacuum left by the legislature (see paragraph ... 47 ... above). However, the 18 lists of voters in question were not the only ones lacking the two signatures in question. In fact, this was a recurrent formal omission because the additional lists of voters had not been signed by the chairs and secretaries of the electoral commissions in a total 116 of the 123 polling stations in Turkish territory (see paragraph 29 above), which amounted to some 42% of all the out-of-country polling stations (see paragraph 13 above). The Court considers that that information only confirms its finding that domestic legislation was insufficiently clear on this specific point. Under those circumstances it considers that that omission, which is purely technical in nature, does not in itself demonstrate that the voting procedure in those 18 polling stations involved irregularities justifying the annulment of the election results.\n175: The Constitutional Court used an additional criterion to annul the election results in the 18 polling stations in question, that is to say the fact that none of the pre-registered voters had cast their votes in those stations. The Court nevertheless observes that domestic legislation did not require Bulgarian citizens to vote on election day, even where they had previously declared their intention to exercise their voting rights. The criterion in question is therefore a complementary one which cannot in itself reveal any particular irregularity in the voting procedure. The Constitutional Court used it exclusively to eliminate the votes cast by persons included on the unsigned additional lists.\n176: These facts are sufficient for the Court to conclude that the decision-making process implemented by the Bulgarian Constitutional Court did not comply with the standards developed in the Court’s case-law (see paragraph 143 above). In particular, the Constitutional Court annulled the election in 22 polling stations on purely formal grounds. Moreover, the elements on which that court relied to justify that part of its decision were not set out clearly and foreseeably enough in domestic law, and it had not been demonstrated that they had affected the electorate’s choice and distorted the election results.\n177: As regards the last polling station, where the results were annulled on the grounds that the number of persons voting was not mentioned on the first page of the minutes (see paragraphs 169 and 170 above), the Court observes that the Bulgarian Electoral Law in force at the material time infringed the recommendations of the Venice Commission’s Code of Good Conduct in Electoral Matters (see paragraph 92 above) by failing to provide for the possibility of organising fresh elections in the event of annulment of voting .... Such a possibility was not introduced into domestic legislation until 2011, and the rule was only applicable where the election results had been annulled in their entirety (ibid.). It is clear that the impossibility of holding fresh elections had at no stage been considered by the Constitutional Court in deciding whether the annulment of the election results, under the particular circumstances of the case, would be a measure proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, whose purpose is to ensure the free expression of voters’ wishes.\n178: The Court bears in mind that organising fresh elections in the territory of another sovereign country, even in a small number of polling stations, is always liable to come up against major diplomatic and operational obstacles and occasion additional cost. However, it considers that the holding of new elections in the last polling station, where there was cogent circumstantial evidence that the electoral commission was responsible for irregularities in the voting procedure on election day (see paragraph 170 above) would have reconciled the legitimate aim of annulling the election results, that is to say protecting the lawfulness of the electoral procedure, with the subjective rights of the voters and candidates in the general elections. The Court observes that the judgment of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court also failed to take that factor into account.\n179: On those grounds, the Court considers that the annulment by the Bulgarian Constitutional Court of the election results in the polling stations in question, the cancellation of Mr Riza’s parliamentary mandate and the DPS’ loss of a parliamentary seat assigned under the proportional system amounted to an interference in the exercise of the 101 applicants’ active electoral rights and of Mr Riza’s and the DPS’ passive electoral rights. Having regard to the lacunae noted in domestic law and the lack of any possibility of organising fresh elections, the impugned judgment, which was based on purely formal arguments, occasioned an unjustified infringement of the 101 applicants’ and Mr Riza’s and the DPS’ rights to take part in the general elections as voters and candidates respectively. There were therefore two separate violations of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n185: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n186: The first applicant, Mr Risa, claimed EUR 60,155 in respect of pecuniary damage, explaining that that amount was the equivalent of four years’ deputy’s salary which he would have received in the national Parliament. He also claimed EUR 15,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n187: In respect of pecuniary damage, the second applicant, the DPS, claimed an amount equal to that which it would have received in State subsidies for four years if the 18,140 votes cast for the party in the 23 polling stations in question had not been deducted from its electoral score. It presented two estimates of that sum computed in accordance with two different methods of calculation which, it submitted, depended on the changes in domestic legislation in connection with the calculation and payment of the State subsidy to political parties ...: EUR 395,507 under the first method and EUR 335,740 under the second.\n188: The other 101 applicants considered that the finding of a violation of their right as guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 would in itself amount to sufficient just satisfaction.\n189: The Government objected to the claims submitted by Mr Riza and the DPS. They invited the Court to declare that the finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction. In the alternative, they submitted that the claims lodged by the first two applicants were excessive and unsubstantiated.\n190: As regards pecuniary damage, the Court observes that Mr Riza and the DPS claimed sums which they stated represented the earnings lost owing to the impugned judgment of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court for a period of four years, that is to say the whole of the 41st parliamentary term. The Court considers that those claims are not sufficiently substantiated, for the reasons set out below.\n191: First of all, the Court notes that the two applicants based their estimates on the presumption that the 41st National Assembly would complete its four-year term. In fact the Assembly was dissolved by Presidential Decree before it could complete its term (see paragraph 52 above). Secondly, the Court observes that Mr Riza, like all national parliamentary deputies, could not have been sure that he would complete his four-year term and that he did not specify the amount of alternative income he received between the time of cancellation of his mandate and the end of the 41st parliamentary term. Thirdly, the Court notes that the finding of a violation in the present case is based not only on the annulment of the elections in the polling stations in question but also on the fact that no new elections could be organised (see paragraphs 176-178 above). Thus the Court is not in a position to calculate the DPS’ lost earnings on the basis of the difference between the annulled votes and the votes which the party would have obtained following hypothetical new elections.\n192: The Court consequently considers that these two applicants’ claims in respect of pecuniary damage should be rejected.\n193: As regards compensation for alleged non-pecuniary damage, in view of the specific circumstances of the case the Court considers that the finding of a violation of the voting rights of the 101 applicants listed in the appendix and the finding of a violation of Mr Riza’s right to stand for election represent sufficient just satisfaction for the non-pecuniary damage which they sustained.\n194: The DPS also claimed EUR 5,300 for costs and expenses, which sum corresponded to the legal fees incurred before the Court. The other 101 applicants claimed EUR 3,400 for costs and expenses, which sum they stated corresponded to legal fees incurred before the Court.\n195: The Government considered that the sums claimed under this head by the applicants were excessive and unsubstantiated.\n196: According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum.\n197: In the present case, the Court observes that all the applicants were represented by the same lawyer and that the pleas put forward by the applicants were largely identical. In view of those circumstances, the documents presented and its relevant case-law, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 6,000 EUR jointly to the DPS and the other 101 applicants.\n198: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

Azerbaijan, no. 18705/06, § 77, 8 April 2010). Its role in determining whether there was an unjustified interference in “the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” is confined to establishing whether the decision given by the domestic court was arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see Babenko v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 43476/98, 4 May 1999; Partija “Jaunie Demokrati” and Partija “Musu Zeme” v.

In the present case it is not the Court’s task to adjudicate in abstracto on the compatibility with the Convention and its Protocols of the legislature’s approach. It will confine itself to assessing whether, in the instant case, the proceedings in issue allowed the applicants to defend their legitimate interests effectively, as persons or parties participating in general elections.",

            "001-60417\n35: That being so, it must determine whether the decision to remove the applicant's name from the list of candidates was proportionate to the aim pursued. In that connection, the Court reiterates that the object and purpose of the Convention, which is an instrument for the protection of human beings, requires its provisions to be interpreted and applied in such a way as to make their stipulations not theoretical or illusory but practical and effective (see, for example, Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15-16, § 33; United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports 1998-I, pp. 18-19, § 33; and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 100, ECHR 1999-III).

In the instant case, the precise subject matter of the dispute had not been determined from the outset of the proceedings, having only been established when the Constitutional Court had delivered judgment. The fact that the Constitutional Court had rejected all the appellants’ arguments put forward one by one, but decided to annul the voting in in 23 polling stations because of formal defects which had been mentioned for the first time in the proceedings by an expert report, at the initiative of the experts in question, revealed a lack of clarity and foreseeability in that regard. The appellants had thus been exempted from the obligation to present evidence of the irregularities allegedly committed in the polling stations in question.

Nevertheless, the Court finds alarming the CEC's failure to even consider the possibility of a recount before invalidating the election results. The Court considers that, in cases where illegal tampering with vote counting or election documents may affect the determination of the outcome of the elections, a fair procedure for recounting votes where such a recount is possible is an important safeguard of the fairness and success of the entire election process. Even accepting the Government's argument that under Azerbaijani law an election recount was optional (at the CEC's discretion) and not mandatory, the Court considers that in the present case the CEC could have considered the possibility of a recount and at least explained the reasons for passing up this opportunity before deciding on an outright invalidation of the election results. In the Court's view, the CEC's failure to do so contributed to the appearance of arbitrariness of its decision."

Although recruits could opt for the latter type of service and were assigned to such civilian institutions as orphanages, retirement homes and hospitals, the system available to the applicants at the time had not been of a genuinely civilian nature, because it had two main shortcomings. First of all, the service had not been sufficiently separated from the military system: the military had been involved in the supervision of the civilian institutions, carrying out regular spot checks, taking measures in the event of unauthorised absence, ordering transfers and determining assignments and the application of military regulations. As regards appearances, civilian servicemen had been required to wear a uniform. Secondly, the programme had been considerably longer than the period of military service (42 months as against 24), which had necessarily had a deterrent, or even punitive, effect.",

They failed to appear, and instead addressed letters to the local military commissariat (զինվորական կոմիսարիատ) and the regional prosecutor’s office, refusing to perform either military or alternative service. They stated that they were Jehovah’s Witnesses and that, having studied the Alternative Service Act, they had come to the conclusion that, by European standards, the service proposed was not of a genuinely civilian nature since it was supervised by the military authorities. Their conscience did not allow them to work directly or indirectly for the military system. The alternative labour service was known to be organised and supervised by the military authorities because the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet was marked “Armed Forces of Armenia”, and alternative servicemen were subject to military discipline and penalties and had to register with the military subdivisions of the Armed Forces of Armenia. Furthermore, the law required that they remain at their place of service around the clock, seven days a week, which was akin to house arrest and was unacceptable to the applicants. The requirement to perform military service or the available alternative service violated their rights guaranteed by, inter alia, Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. For the reasons stated above, their conscience did not allow them to perform the alternative service available in Armenia. The applicants added that they were willing to perform alternative service as long as it was not in any way connected with the military authorities and did not violate their religious beliefs.\n\n001-177429\n21: The applicants lodged appeals against their convictions, arguing that they violated the requirements of Article 9 of the Convention. Their opposition to the alternative service available in Armenia was based on their religious beliefs, as that service was not of a genuinely civilian nature and failed to comply with European standards. It was organised and supervised by the military authorities (section 14 of the Alternative Service Act (see paragraph 28 below)) and was equivalent to non-armed military service, whereas their conscience did not allow them to perform any service supervised by the military authorities. Furthermore, section 17(3) of the Act authorised a military authority to order the transfer of an alternative labour serviceman to another institution, while certain aspects of the service were organised in accordance with military rules (section 18(2) of the Act). Alternative labour servicemen were also required to wear a uniform that resembled a military uniform and to follow orders, and were not allowed to leave their place of service without authorisation. The cover of the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet (այլընտրանքային աշխատանքային ծառայողի գրքույկ) bore the coat of arms and the words “The Armed Forces of Armenia”, and the monthly allowance paid was the same as that of military servicemen. Moreover, alternative service was punitive in nature as it lasted forty-two months and alternative servicemen were required to stay at their place of service around the clock. They reiterated their readiness to perform a genuinely civilian alternative service and argued that, in the absence of alternative service that complied with European standards and was of a truly civilian nature, their sentences did not pursue a pressing social need and were not necessary in a democratic society.\n\n001-177429\n17: In the course of the proceedings before their respective trial courts, the applicants submitted that their opposition to military and alternative service was based on their religious beliefs. The alternative service provided for under domestic law was not of a genuinely civilian nature, as it was supervised by the military authorities. The right to conscientious objection was protected by, inter alia, Article 9 of the Convention. The applicants were willing to perform alternative service as long as it was not supervised by the military and was of a genuinely civilian nature.\u003C/s\u003E\u003Cs\u003E[INST] You are an ECHR legal expert tasked to answer a question.\n\nAnswer the following question using the retrieved documents.

                "CASE OF ADYAN AND OTHERS v. ARMENIA; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 75604/11) against the Republic of Armenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Armenian nationals, Mr Artur Adyan, Mr Garegin Avetisyan, Mr Harutyun Khachatryan and Mr Vahagn Margaryan (jointly “the applicants”), on 6 December 201\n2: The applicants were represented by Mr P. Muzny, Professor of Law at the Universities of Savoy and Geneva, and Mr A. Carbonneau and Mr A. Martirosyan, lawyers practising in Paris and Yerevan respectively. The Armenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Kostanyan, Representative of the Republic of Armenia to the European Court of Human Rights.\n3: The applicants alleged, in particular, that their convictions had violated the guarantees of Article 9 of the Convention and that their detention had been based on stereotyped reasoning by the courts.\n4: On 29 February 2016 the complaints concerning the applicants’ conviction for evasion of military and alternative service and the failure of the courts to provide relevant and sufficient reasons for their pre-trial detention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.\n5: Mr Armen Harutyunyan, the judge elected in respect of Armenia, was unable to sit in the case (Rule 28). Accordingly, the President of the Chamber decided to appoint Mrs Siranush Sahakyan to sit as an ad hoc judge (Rule 29 § 1(b)).\n6: Mr Adyan (“the first applicant”) was born in 1991, while Mr Avetisyan, Mr Khachatryan and Mr Margaryan (“the second, third and fourth applicants”) were born in 1993. The first and second applicants live in Yerevan, while the third and fourth applicants live in Tsaghkavan and Kapan respectively.\n7: The applicants are four Jehovah’s Witnesses who were found to be fit for military service.\n8: In May and June 2011 the applicants were called up for military service. They failed to appear, and instead addressed letters to the local military commissariat (զինվորական կոմիսարիատ) and the regional prosecutor’s office, refusing to perform either military or alternative service. They stated that they were Jehovah’s Witnesses and that, having studied the Alternative Service Act, they had come to the conclusion that, by European standards, the service proposed was not of a genuinely civilian nature since it was supervised by the military authorities. Their conscience did not allow them to work directly or indirectly for the military system. The alternative labour service was known to be organised and supervised by the military authorities because the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet was marked “Armed Forces of Armenia”, and alternative servicemen were subject to military discipline and penalties and had to register with the military subdivisions of the Armed Forces of Armenia. Furthermore, the law required that they remain at their place of service around the clock, seven days a week, which was akin to house arrest and was unacceptable to the applicants. The requirement to perform military service or the available alternative service violated their rights guaranteed by, inter alia, Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. For the reasons stated above, their conscience did not allow them to perform the alternative service available in Armenia. The applicants added that they were willing to perform alternative service as long as it was not in any way connected with the military authorities and did not violate their religious beliefs.\n9: On 15 June 2011 charges were brought against the second applicant under Article 327 § 1 of the Criminal Code (evasion of regular conscription for military or alternative service).\n10: On 6 July 2011 the first and fourth applicants were arrested.\n11: On 7 July 2011 the same charges were brought against the first and fourth applicants. Finding the investigator’s applications for their detention substantiated, the Syunik Regional Court decided to detain them.\n12: On 28 July 2011 the Criminal Court of Appeal dismissed appeals lodged by the first and fourth applicants against the detention orders, finding, inter alia, that as the alleged offence carried a sentence of more than one year’s imprisonment, that increased the probability that the first and fourth applicants would commit a new offence or evade punishment if they remained at large.\n13: On 27 July 2011 the same charges were brought against the third applicant and the Tavush Regional Court decided to detain him at the investigator’s request, finding that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence with which he was charged.\n14: On an unspecified date his criminal case was sent to court.\n15: On 19 August 2011 the Tavush Regional Court decided to set the case down for trial, finding that the “detention was to remain unchanged”.\n16: On 24 August 2011 the Criminal Court of Appeal examined an appeal lodged by the third applicant against the detention order of 27 July 2011 and decided to dismiss it, finding, inter alia, that the offence with which he was charged carried a sentence of more than one year’s imprisonment, which increased the probability that he would commit a new offence or evade punishment if he remained at large.\n17: In the course of the proceedings before their respective trial courts, the applicants submitted that their opposition to military and alternative service was based on their religious beliefs. The alternative service provided for under domestic law was not of a genuinely civilian nature, as it was supervised by the military authorities. The right to conscientious objection was protected by, inter alia, Article 9 of the Convention. The applicants were willing to perform alternative service as long as it was not supervised by the military and was of a genuinely civilian nature.\n18: On 19 July 2011 the Kotayk Regional Court found the second applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to two years and six months in prison. He was taken into custody on the same day.\n19: On 27 July 2011 the Syunik Regional Court imposed similar sentences on the first and fourth applicants.\n20: On 25 November 2011 the Tavush Regional Court imposed a similar sentence on the third applicant.\n21: The applicants lodged appeals against their convictions, arguing that they violated the requirements of Article 9 of the Convention. Their opposition to the alternative service available in Armenia was based on their religious beliefs, as that service was not of a genuinely civilian nature and failed to comply with European standards. It was organised and supervised by the military authorities (section 14 of the Alternative Service Act (see paragraph 28 below)) and was equivalent to non-armed military service, whereas their conscience did not allow them to perform any service supervised by the military authorities. Furthermore, section 17(3) of the Act authorised a military authority to order the transfer of an alternative labour serviceman to another institution, while certain aspects of the service were organised in accordance with military rules (section 18(2) of the Act). Alternative labour servicemen were also required to wear a uniform that resembled a military uniform and to follow orders, and were not allowed to leave their place of service without authorisation. The cover of the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet (այլընտրանքային աշխատանքային ծառայողի գրքույկ) bore the coat of arms and the words “The Armed Forces of Armenia”, and the monthly allowance paid was the same as that of military servicemen. Moreover, alternative service was punitive in nature as it lasted forty-two months and alternative servicemen were required to stay at their place of service around the clock. They reiterated their readiness to perform a genuinely civilian alternative service and argued that, in the absence of alternative service that complied with European standards and was of a truly civilian nature, their sentences did not pursue a pressing social need and were not necessary in a democratic society.\n22: On 2 December 2011 the Criminal Court of Appeal upheld the judgments of the Regional Courts in the cases of the first and second applicants.\n23: On 9 December 2011 and 6 March 2012 the Criminal Court of Appeal adopted judgments in the cases of the third and fourth applicants similar to its judgment in the case of the first applicant.\n24: The applicants lodged appeals on points of law, raising the same arguments as in their appeals.\n25: On 7, 8 and 17 February and 7 May 2012 the Court of Cassation declared the applicants’ appeals inadmissible for lack of merit.\n26: On 8 and 9 October 2013 the applicants were released from prison following a general amnesty, after having served between twenty-six and twenty-seven months of their sentences.\n27: Article 327 § 1 provides that evasion of regular conscription for fixed-term military or alternative service, in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from such service, is punishable by detention (defined in this context as imprisonment under conditions of strict isolation) for a period not exceeding two months or imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years.\n28: The relevant provisions of the Alternative Service Act of 17 December 2003, which entered into force on 1 July 2004, read as follows:\n29: On 28 April 2011 amendments were proposed to the Alternative Service Act. In the Explanatory Report on the proposed amendments, it was indicated that the Act – introduced for the purpose of fulfilling the obligations assumed by Armenia upon joining the Council of Europe – fell short of international standards. Its main shortcomings included the following:\n30: The amendments in question were eventually passed on 2 May 2013 and entered into force on 8 June 2013. They included the following changes:\n31: Section 4 provides that the term of compulsory military service for privates is twenty-four months.\n32: On 2 May 2013 a number of amendments to the Act were passed. They entered into force on 8 June 2013 and included the following amendment:\n33: Pursuant to paragraph 2(b), alternative labour servicemen were to perform their service in various institutions under the authority of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, such as orphanages, retirement homes, mental health institutions, institutions for disabled persons and hospitals. They were to perform the functions of an orderly. Pursuant to paragraph 3, the Minister of Defence, the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs and the Minister of Health were entrusted with providing alternative labour servicemen with clothing, food and financial means. The decree also set out the rules on the uniforms to be worn by both alternative military servicemen and alternative labour servicemen.\n34: On 1 August 2013 the decree was amended and made applicable only to alternative military servicemen.\n35: The decree established a National Commission to examine applications for alternative service. The commission was composed of the head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Armenia, as its president, the Military Commissar of Armenia (ՀՀ զինվորական կոմիսար) as its vice-president, the Deputy Minister of Health, the Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, the head of the Governmental Department for National Minorities and Religious Affairs, and the head of the Governmental Department for Administrative Bodies.\n36: On 25 July 2013 the decree was repealed and replaced with Decree No. 797-A, which modified the composition of the National Commission to include the First Deputy Minister of Territorial Administration as its president, the Deputy Minister of Health, the Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, the Deputy Minister of Education and Science, the Deputy Minister of Defence, the Deputy Chief of Police and the head of the Governmental Department for National Minorities and Religious Affairs.\n37: For the purpose of supervising the work discipline of persons conscripted to perform alternative labour service, the Military Commissar of Armenia and the head of the Military Police Division of the Ministry of Defence were ordered: (a) to carry out weekly joint spot checks to verify the presence of persons performing alternative labour service at the institutions located within the territory of the regional military commissariats and their sub-divisions; (b) to report the results of such checks to the head of the General Staff at the end of each month; and (c) to report immediately to the head of the General Staff in the event that any alternative labour servicemen were absent and to take necessary measures to find them.\n38: On 28 March 2014 and 27 March 2015 the Court of Cassation examined appeals by two conscientious objectors against their convictions by the lower courts under Article 327 of the Criminal Code (criminal cases nos. KD1/0053/01/12 and GD1/0006/01/13). It found that since their cases met the conditions specified in the Criminal Code Implementation Act, as amended on 8 June 2013, the provisions of that Act were applicable and hence their sentences were to be quashed and the criminal proceedings discontinued for lack of corpus delicti.\n39: In his 2008 Annual Report, the Human Rights Defender noted:\n40: The Committee of Ministers noted that “alternative service shall not be of a punitive nature. Its duration shall, in comparison to that of military service, remain within reasonable limits”.\n41: The Committee of Ministers recommended that member States should ensure that any limitations on the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion of members of the armed forces complied with the requirements of Article 9 § 2 of the Convention, that conscripts should have the right to be granted conscientious objector status and that alternative service of a civilian nature should be proposed to them. The Explanatory Memorandum to this Recommendation noted, in particular, that the length of any alternative service to be performed by objectors should be reasonable in comparison with the length of ordinary military service. It further noted that the European Committee of Social Rights had deemed alternative service exceeding oneandahalf times the length of military service to be excessive.\n42: PACE recommended that the Committee of Ministers invite those member States that had not yet done so to introduce into their legislation a genuine alternative service of a clearly civilian nature, which should be neither deterrent nor punitive in character.\n43: PACE noted that Armenia had undertaken to honour the following commitment:\n44: As regards Armenia’s commitment to enact legislation on alternative service “in compliance with European standards” and “pardon all conscientious objectors sentenced to prison terms”, PACE noted with disappointment that the current law, as amended in 2005 and subsequently in June 2006, still did not offer conscientious objectors any guarantee of “genuine alternative service of a clearly civilian nature, which should be neither deterrent nor punitive in character”, as provided for by Council of Europe standards. It was deeply concerned that, for lack of a genuine form of civilian service, dozens of conscientious objectors, most of whom were Jehovah’s Witnesses, continued to be imprisoned, since they preferred prison to an alternative service which was not of a truly civilian nature. PACE urged the Armenian authorities to amend the law on alternative service in accordance with the recommendations made by the Council of Europe experts and, in the meantime, to pardon the young conscientious objectors serving prison sentences.\n45: In its Second Report on Armenia, adopted on 30 June 2006, ECRI noted:\n46: In his report of 9 May 2011 following his visit to Armenia from 18 to 21 January 2011, the Commissioner stated:\n47: In their formal response to the Commissioner’s report, the Government admitted that the exercise of the right to conscientious objection was still flawed in Armenia, and that they intended to introduce further legislative amendments to promote civilian control over alternative service and completely to withdraw military control over such service. That function was to be assigned to a new body composed of representatives of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and strictly civil service officers of the Ministry of Defence.\n48: In its Conclusions XIX-1 of 24 October 2008 regarding compliance by Greece with Article 1 § 2 of the European Social Charter (The right to work: effective protection of the right of the worker to earn his living in an occupation freely entered upon), the European Committee of Social Rights noted:\n49: The applicants complained that the criminal proceedings against them and their convictions had violated their rights guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n50: The Government argued that the applicants had failed to exhaust domestic remedies. In particular, on 2 May 2013 amendments had been introduced to the Criminal Code Implementation Act, pursuant to which: (a) a person serving a sentence under Article 327 of the Criminal Code was to be released provided that he applied for alternative service before 1 August 2013 and his application was granted; (b) both pre-trial and trial proceedings were to be discontinued; (c) the criminal record of those concerned was to be deleted; and (d) the term of alternative service was to be reduced by the period of actual service of the sentence or the period of deprivation of liberty during criminal prosecution. After the introduction of those amendments, the Court of Cassation had quashed a number of convictions of conscientious objectors and discontinued the criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti. The amendments had been introduced while the applicants were still serving their sentences. Thus, they had had the opportunity to be afforded appropriate redress by means of acquittal and rehabilitation had they applied for alternative service before a specific date, but they had not seized that opportunity.\n51: The applicants contested the Government’s non-exhaustion claim and argued that the provisions of the Criminal Code Implementation Act as amended did not constitute an effective remedy as they did not provide a possibility for genuine rehabilitation or for compensation to be paid. Substituting the remainder of their sentences with alternative service would have led to a situation in which, having served twenty-four months in prison, they would still need to perform a further twelve months of alternative service, because one full day of imprisonment was equivalent to one eight-hour working day of alternative service. Such a scheme was punitive and akin to substituting their terms of imprisonment for a noncustodial sentence and then increasing their sentences from thirty to thirtysix months, which could not be considered an acquittal or rehabilitation. Moreover, the Government had failed to disclose that the National Commission, that is the authority entrusted with deciding on applications for alternative service, had not begun functioning until months after the amendments had been introduced, with its first hearing being held on 23 October 2013. By then, the applicants had already been released from prison.\n52: The Court considers that the Government’s objection of nonexhaustion is closely linked to the substance of the applicants’ complaint and must be joined to the merits.\n53: Furthermore, although the parties did not contest the applicability of Article 9 to the case, the Court considers it necessary to address this question of its own motion. It reiterates in this regard that opposition to military service, where it is motivated by a serious and insurmountable conflict between the obligation to serve in the army and a person’s conscience or his deeply and genuinely held religious or other beliefs, constitutes a conviction or belief of sufficient cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance to attract the guarantees of Article 9. Whether and to what extent objection to military service falls within the ambit of that provision must be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case (see Bayatyan v. Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 110, ECHR 2011; Erçep v. Turkey, no. 43965/04, § 47, 22 November 2011; Savda v. Turkey, no. 42730/05, § 91, 12 June 2012; and Papavasilakis v. Greece, no. 66899/14, § 36, 15 September 2016).\n54: In the present case, the applicants are Jehovah’s Witnesses, a religious group whose beliefs include the conviction that service, even unarmed, within the military is to be opposed. Article 9 has already been found to be applicable to such opposition to military service (see Bayatyan, cited above, § 111). However, in contrast to the case of Bayatyan, the applicants in the present case objected to performing not only military service but also the substitute service which had been available in Armenia since 2004, alleging that it was not of a genuinely civilian nature and was punitive in nature. Having regard to the overall circumstances of the case, the Court has no reason to doubt that the applicants’ objection to both military and alternative service was motivated by their religious beliefs, which were genuinely held and were in serious and insurmountable conflict with their obligation to perform such service. Accordingly, Article 9 is applicable to the applicants’ case.\n55: The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n56: The applicants alleged that the alternative labour service was not of a genuinely civilian nature, referring to the arguments raised in that connection in their appeals (see paragraph 21 above). Although the physical work of an alternative labour serviceman was technically performed at a civilian institution, everything about that programme and all the activities of the serviceman were under military control and supervision. The military authorities could transfer an alternative labour serviceman at will to another assignment. He was required to be at his place of assignment twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and was ordered to wear a uniform provided by the military authorities, which was similar in appearance to a military uniform. The cover of the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet bore the military insignia and once his service had been completed he would be discharged and registered in the military reserve. Any violation of the prescribed procedure gave rise to sanctions in accordance with military rules and any orders given to an alternative labour serviceman were to be implemented in accordance with a procedure prescribed by the Act Establishing the Internal Rules of Service in the Armed Forces. Alternative labour servicemen were at all times subject to military authority and discipline. Thus, it could not be said that the alternative labour service contained only a few formal elements of military supervision, as the Government claimed (see paragraph 58 below). In fact, from the perspective of religious conscience, it was the same as unarmed military service.\n57: The applicants further referred to the fact that the law had later been amended, arguing that the Government had conceded that it had been fundamentally flawed. One of the main defects identified when the amendments had been proposed was that the alternative labour service was under military control. Prior to those amendments there had been no genuine alternative service of a clearly civilian nature in Armenia. PACE and the Committee of Ministers had repeatedly called on the Armenian authorities to introduce a clearly civilian service. The applicants submitted that the fact that the law had eventually been amended in 2013 to remove all military control and supervision and to place the programme under a purely civilian administration also confirmed that it had not been necessary in a democratic society to prosecute and imprison them.\n58: The Government submitted that in 2003 Armenia had enacted a law on alternative service as part of the commitments undertaken upon joining the Council of Europe. Unfortunately, it had transpired that there were a number of omissions in that law and inconsistencies with the European standards. However, in deciding on the applicants’ criminal cases, the domestic courts had been bound to apply the law as in force at the material time. Referring to the findings of the Criminal Court of Appeal, the Government argued that the alternative labour service available at the material time had been of a civilian nature and contained only a few formal elements of military supervision in theory, not being directly controlled by the military in practice. Thus, the interference was legitimate and prescribed by law.\n59: The Government further submitted that the present case was to be distinguished from the Bayatyan case, since the applicants in the present case had had the possibility of substituting military service with alternative service of a civilian nature. Nevertheless, taking into account the shift in the case-law brought about by the Bayatyan judgment and a number of opinions and recommendations of various international bodies, including the Venice Commission, the domestic law had been amended on 2 May 2013 in order to provide a possibility for those who objected not only to the carrying of arms or performing other military activities but also to serving under any type of military command in general. In conclusion, there had been no interference with the applicants’ right to freedom of thought, conscience or religion and there had been no violation of Article 9 of the Convention.\n60: The Government made contradictory submissions regarding the existence of an interference, arguing, on the one hand, that “the interference was legitimate and prescribed by law”, but, on the other hand, that there was no interference. In any event, the Court considers that the applicants’ refusal to be drafted for military and alternative service was a manifestation of their religious beliefs and their conviction for draft evasion therefore amounted to an interference with their freedom to manifest their religion, as guaranteed by Article 9 § 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, § 112). Such interference will be contrary to Article 9 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims set out in paragraph 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” (see, among other authorities, İzzettin Doğan and Others v. Turkey [GC], no. 62649/10, § 98, ECHR 2016).\n61: There is no dispute between the parties as to whether the interference was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim.\n62: The Court considers it unnecessary to determine this question, since the interference was in any event incompatible with Article 9 for the reasons set out below (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, §§ 113-17).\n63: The Court reiterates that, as enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a “democratic society” within the meaning of the Convention. This freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, § 34, ECHR 1999I; Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 104, ECHR 2005XI; and Bayatyan, cited above, § 118).\n64: While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to manifest one’s religion, alone and in private, or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. Article 9 lists a number of forms which manifestation of one’s religion or belief may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance (see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 60, ECHR 2000XI, and Bayatyan, cited above, § 119).\n65: According to its settled case-law, the Court leaves to States Parties to the Convention a certain margin of appreciation in deciding whether and to what extent an interference is necessary. This margin of appreciation goes hand in hand with European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it. The Court’s task is to determine whether the measures taken at national level were justified in principle and proportionate (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 110). Furthermore, in so far as the Court has had opportunity to consider this issue, it has made clear that a State which has not introduced alternatives to compulsory military service in order to reconcile the possible conflict between individual conscience and military obligations enjoys only a limited margin of appreciation and must advance convincing and compelling reasons to justify any interference. In particular, it must demonstrate that the interference corresponds to a “pressing social need” (see Bayatyan, cited above, § 123).\n66: The Court has also held that any system of compulsory military service imposes a heavy burden on citizens. It will be acceptable if it is shared in an equitable manner and if exemptions from this duty are based on solid and convincing grounds. However, a system which imposes on citizens an obligation which has potentially serious implications for conscientious objectors, such as the obligation to serve in the army, without making allowances for the exigencies of an individual’s conscience and beliefs, would fail to strike a fair balance between the interests of society as a whole and those of the individual (ibid., §§ 124 and 125).\n67: The Court notes that, in contrast to the Bayatyan case cited above, the applicants in the present case, as already noted above, had the opportunity at the material time to refuse compulsory military service for reasons of conscience and to perform “alternative labour service” instead, pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of the Alternative Service Act, since such service had been introduced in Armenia in 2004 and was performed outside the armed forces of Armenia (see paragraph 28 above). However, in the Court’s opinion, that fact alone is not sufficient to conclude that the authorities have discharged their obligations under Article 9 of the Convention. The Court must also verify that the allowances made were appropriate for the exigencies of an individual’s conscience and beliefs. In this connection, while accepting that the States Parties to the Convention enjoy a certain margin of appreciation regarding the manner in which their systems of alternative service are organised and implemented, the Court considers that the right to conscientious objection guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention would be illusory if a State were allowed to organise and implement its system of alternative service in a way that would fail to offer – whether in law or in practice – an alternative to military service of a genuinely civilian nature and one which was not deterrent or punitive in character. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the alternative labour service available to the applicants at the material time complied with those requirements.\n68: The Court notes that it is not in dispute between the parties that the work performed by alternative labour servicemen was of a civilian nature. Such servicemen were assigned to various civilian institutions, such as orphanages, retirement homes, mental health institutions, institutions for disabled persons and hospitals, and performed the functions of an orderly (see paragraph 33 above). However, in the Court’s opinion, the nature of the work performed is only one of the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether alternative service is of a genuinely civilian nature. Such factors as authority, control, applicable rules and appearances may also be important for the determination of that question.\n69: The Court notes, firstly, that, while alternative labour servicemen were accountable and subordinate primarily to the heads of the civilian institutions where the service was performed, the military authorities were, nevertheless, actively involved in the supervision of that service. In particular, they carried out regular spot checks at the relevant civilian institutions, upon the order of the head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Armenia, for the purpose of “supervising the work discipline of alternative labour servicemen”. In the event of the unauthorised absence of an alternative labour serviceman, they were required to take measures to find him (see paragraph 37 above). Secondly, the military authorities had the power to influence an alternative labour serviceman’s service by ordering his transfer to another institution or place of service (see section 17(3) of the Alternative Service Act in paragraph 28 above). Thirdly, certain aspects of the alternative labour service were organised in accordance with the Internal Rules of Service in the Armed Forces (see section 18(2) of the Act in paragraph 28 above). The Court further refers to the findings of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, which the Government did not explicitly contest, according to which the heads of the civilian institutions where alternative labour service was performed received instructions about the conditions and modalities of the service from the military, while conscientious objectors were sent to military hospitals for medical treatment and received assignments and changes of assignments determined by the military (see paragraph 47 above). The Court therefore considers that the alternative labour service was not sufficiently separated hierarchically and institutionally from the military system at the material time. Furthermore, as regards appearances, the Court notes that alternative civilian servicemen were required to wear a uniform and to stay at their place of service. They also had “The Armed Forces of Armenia” written on the cover of their alternative labour serviceman’s record booklets. Thus, taking into account all the above-mentioned factors, the Court considers that the alternative labour service available to the applicants at the material time was not of a genuinely civilian nature.\n70: The Court turns to the question as to whether the alternative labour service could be perceived as being deterrent or punitive in character. It considers that the duration of the service may be a relevant factor to consider, among others, when determining this question. In this connection, the Court refers to the findings of the European Committee of Social Rights, also mentioned by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in his report following his visit to Armenia in January 2011, to the effect that the length of alternative service may not exceed one and a half times the length of armed military service (see paragraphs 46 and 48 above). In Armenia, where armed military service lasts for a relatively long period of twenty-four months (see paragraph 31 above), the alternative labour service was significantly longer than one and a half times that period, lasting, at the material time, forty-two months (see section 5 of the Alternative Service Act in paragraph 28 above). In the Court’s opinion, such a significant difference in duration of service must have had a deterrent effect and can be said to have contained a punitive element.\n71: The Court also notes that the Government admitted that the system of alternative labour service, as provided for by the Alternative Service Act, had shortcomings. The Armenian parliament was even more explicit in its criticism of the alternative labour service, pointing out as two of its main shortcomings the military supervision and its duration (see paragraph 29 above). The Alternative Service Act was eventually amended in 2013 with the purpose of eliminating the shortcomings, and a number of relevant governmental decrees were subsequently also amended or repealed (see paragraphs 30, 34 and 36 above). The Court lastly notes that the shortcomings of the alternative labour service were also highlighted in a number of international and domestic reports (see paragraphs 39 and 44-47 above).\n72: In the light of the above, the Court concludes that the authorities failed, at the material time, to make appropriate allowances for the exigencies of the applicants’ conscience and beliefs and to guarantee a system of alternative service that struck a fair balance between the interests of society as a whole and those of the applicants, as required by Article 9 of the Convention. It follows that the applicants’ convictions constituted interferences which were not necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of that provision.\n73: Having reached this conclusion, the Court considers it necessary to address the Government’s non-exhaustion objection. The Court notes that the authorities introduced legislative amendments on 8 June 2013 which allowed the applicants to have their final convictions reviewed and to be released from prison, conditional on having submitted applications before 1 August 2013 seeking to perform alternative service and on such applications being granted by the relevant authority (see paragraph 32 above). By then, the applicants had already served almost two years of their sentences. Furthermore, that measure was introduced after the applicants had already lodged their applications with the Court. The Court notes that, while the measure could have potentially led to the commutation of the remainder of the applicants’ sentences with alternative service and the quashing of their final convictions for lack of corpus delicti, it does not appear from the case-law of the Court of Cassation – nor has it been argued by the Government – that it was meant to lead to an acknowledgment of a violation of their rights guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention or to an award of compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants as a result of an alleged violation of those rights (see paragraph 38 above). Moreover, that measure was conditional on the applicants’ performance of alternative service instead of serving the remainder of their sentences and depended on the positive exercise of a discretion by the relevant authority. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the measure in question was not an effective and adequate remedy capable of providing redress in respect of violations of the applicants’ rights. It therefore decides to dismiss the Government’s non-exhaustion objection.\n74: There has accordingly been a violation of Article 9 of the Convention.\n75: The first, third and fourth applicants complained that the courts had failed to provide relevant and sufficient reasons in their decisions to detain them. They relied on Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.\n76: The Government contested those allegations.\n77: Having regard to the facts of the case, the submissions of the parties and its findings under Article 9 of the Convention, the Court considers that it has examined the main legal question raised in the present application and that there is no need to give a separate ruling on this complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, Kamil Uzun v. Turkey, no. 37410/97, § 64, 10 May 2007, and Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, § 156, ECHR 2014).\n78: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n79: The applicants claimed 32,400 euros (EUR) each in respect of nonpecuniary damage.\n80: The Government contested the claims and submitted that the amounts claimed were exorbitant.\n81: The Court considers that the applicants have undoubtedly suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of their convictions and imprisonment. It awards them EUR 12,000 each in respect of such damage.\n82: The applicants also claimed a total of EUR 11,900 for the costs of the two lawyers who had represented them before the domestic courts and EUR 9,000 for the costs of the two lawyers who had represented them before the Court. In support of their claims, the applicants submitted letters addressed to them by the lawyers requesting lump-sum payments for various portions of the work done.\n83: The Government submitted that the amounts requested were excessive and not duly substantiated. Firstly, the applicants had engaged an excessive number of lawyers. Secondly, the hourly rates claimed (EUR 200 to 300) were unheard of in Armenia. Thirdly, the amounts in question could not be said to have been actually incurred because the letters submitted by the applicants, in the absence of an actual contract between the parties or an invoice, could not serve as a proof of payment or of an obligation to pay. Fourthly, the applicants had failed to provide detailed information on the number of hours of work performed.\n84: According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, the applicants have failed to submit any legal document, such as a contract signed with their representatives or invoices issued by them, in support of their claim that they were bound to pay the amounts in question. The letters submitted by the applicants could not serve as such proof. In such circumstances, the Court rejects the applicants’ claim for legal costs.\n85: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

            "001-177429\n8: In May and June 2011 the applicants were called up for military service. They failed to appear, and instead addressed letters to the local military commissariat (զինվորական կոմիսարիատ) and the regional prosecutor’s office, refusing to perform either military or alternative service. They stated that they were Jehovah’s Witnesses and that, having studied the Alternative Service Act, they had come to the conclusion that, by European standards, the service proposed was not of a genuinely civilian nature since it was supervised by the military authorities. Their conscience did not allow them to work directly or indirectly for the military system. The alternative labour service was known to be organised and supervised by the military authorities because the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet was marked “Armed Forces of Armenia”, and alternative servicemen were subject to military discipline and penalties and had to register with the military subdivisions of the Armed Forces of Armenia. Furthermore, the law required that they remain at their place of service around the clock, seven days a week, which was akin to house arrest and was unacceptable to the applicants. The requirement to perform military service or the available alternative service violated their rights guaranteed by, inter alia, Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. For the reasons stated above, their conscience did not allow them to perform the alternative service available in Armenia. The applicants added that they were willing to perform alternative service as long as it was not in any way connected with the military authorities and did not violate their religious beliefs.",
            "001-177429\n21: The applicants lodged appeals against their convictions, arguing that they violated the requirements of Article 9 of the Convention. Their opposition to the alternative service available in Armenia was based on their religious beliefs, as that service was not of a genuinely civilian nature and failed to comply with European standards. It was organised and supervised by the military authorities (section 14 of the Alternative Service Act (see paragraph 28 below)) and was equivalent to non-armed military service, whereas their conscience did not allow them to perform any service supervised by the military authorities. Furthermore, section 17(3) of the Act authorised a military authority to order the transfer of an alternative labour serviceman to another institution, while certain aspects of the service were organised in accordance with military rules (section 18(2) of the Act). Alternative labour servicemen were also required to wear a uniform that resembled a military uniform and to follow orders, and were not allowed to leave their place of service without authorisation. The cover of the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet (այլընտրանքային աշխատանքային ծառայողի գրքույկ) bore the coat of arms and the words “The Armed Forces of Armenia”, and the monthly allowance paid was the same as that of military servicemen. Moreover, alternative service was punitive in nature as it lasted forty-two months and alternative servicemen were required to stay at their place of service around the clock. They reiterated their readiness to perform a genuinely civilian alternative service and argued that, in the absence of alternative service that complied with European standards and was of a truly civilian nature, their sentences did not pursue a pressing social need and were not necessary in a democratic society.",
            "001-177429\n17: In the course of the proceedings before their respective trial courts, the applicants submitted that their opposition to military and alternative service was based on their religious beliefs. The alternative service provided for under domestic law was not of a genuinely civilian nature, as it was supervised by the military authorities. The right to conscientious objection was protected by, inter alia, Article 9 of the Convention. The applicants were willing to perform alternative service as long as it was not supervised by the military and was of a genuinely civilian nature.",
            "001-177429\n41: The Committee of Ministers recommended that member States should ensure that any limitations on the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion of members of the armed forces complied with the requirements of Article 9 § 2 of the Convention, that conscripts should have the right to be granted conscientious objector status and that alternative service of a civilian nature should be proposed to them. The Explanatory Memorandum to this Recommendation noted, in particular, that the length of any alternative service to be performed by objectors should be reasonable in comparison with the length of ordinary military service. It further noted that the European Committee of Social Rights had deemed alternative service exceeding oneandahalf times the length of military service to be excessive.",
            "001-177429\n67: The Court notes that, in contrast to the Bayatyan case cited above, the applicants in the present case, as already noted above, had the opportunity at the material time to refuse compulsory military service for reasons of conscience and to perform “alternative labour service” instead, pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of the Alternative Service Act, since such service had been introduced in Armenia in 2004 and was performed outside the armed forces of Armenia (see paragraph 28 above). However, in the Court’s opinion, that fact alone is not sufficient to conclude that the authorities have discharged their obligations under Article 9 of the Convention. The Court must also verify that the allowances made were appropriate for the exigencies of an individual’s conscience and beliefs. In this connection, while accepting that the States Parties to the Convention enjoy a certain margin of appreciation regarding the manner in which their systems of alternative service are organised and implemented, the Court considers that the right to conscientious objection guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention would be illusory if a State were allowed to organise and implement its system of alternative service in a way that would fail to offer – whether in law or in practice – an alternative to military service of a genuinely civilian nature and one which was not deterrent or punitive in character. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the alternative labour service available to the applicants at the material time complied with those requirements.",
            "001-177429\n70: The Court turns to the question as to whether the alternative labour service could be perceived as being deterrent or punitive in character. It considers that the duration of the service may be a relevant factor to consider, among others, when determining this question. In this connection, the Court refers to the findings of the European Committee of Social Rights, also mentioned by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in his report following his visit to Armenia in January 2011, to the effect that the length of alternative service may not exceed one and a half times the length of armed military service (see paragraphs 46 and 48 above). In Armenia, where armed military service lasts for a relatively long period of twenty-four months (see paragraph 31 above), the alternative labour service was significantly longer than one and a half times that period, lasting, at the material time, forty-two months (see section 5 of the Alternative Service Act in paragraph 28 above). In the Court’s opinion, such a significant difference in duration of service must have had a deterrent effect and can be said to have contained a punitive element.",
            "001-177429\n69: The Court notes, firstly, that, while alternative labour servicemen were accountable and subordinate primarily to the heads of the civilian institutions where the service was performed, the military authorities were, nevertheless, actively involved in the supervision of that service. In particular, they carried out regular spot checks at the relevant civilian institutions, upon the order of the head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Armenia, for the purpose of “supervising the work discipline of alternative labour servicemen”. In the event of the unauthorised absence of an alternative labour serviceman, they were required to take measures to find him (see paragraph 37 above). Secondly, the military authorities had the power to influence an alternative labour serviceman’s service by ordering his transfer to another institution or place of service (see section 17(3) of the Alternative Service Act in paragraph 28 above). Thirdly, certain aspects of the alternative labour service were organised in accordance with the Internal Rules of Service in the Armed Forces (see section 18(2) of the Act in paragraph 28 above). The Court further refers to the findings of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, which the Government did not explicitly contest, according to which the heads of the civilian institutions where alternative labour service was performed received instructions about the conditions and modalities of the service from the military, while conscientious objectors were sent to military hospitals for medical treatment and received assignments and changes of assignments determined by the military (see paragraph 47 above). The Court therefore considers that the alternative labour service was not sufficiently separated hierarchically and institutionally from the military system at the material time. Furthermore, as regards appearances, the Court notes that alternative civilian servicemen were required to wear a uniform and to stay at their place of service. They also had “The Armed Forces of Armenia” written on the cover of their alternative labour serviceman’s record booklets. Thus, taking into account all the above-mentioned factors, the Court considers that the alternative labour service available to the applicants at the material time was not of a genuinely civilian nature.",
            "001-177429\n54: In the present case, the applicants are Jehovah’s Witnesses, a religious group whose beliefs include the conviction that service, even unarmed, within the military is to be opposed. Article 9 has already been found to be applicable to such opposition to military service (see Bayatyan, cited above, § 111). However, in contrast to the case of Bayatyan, the applicants in the present case objected to performing not only military service but also the substitute service which had been available in Armenia since 2004, alleging that it was not of a genuinely civilian nature and was punitive in nature. Having regard to the overall circumstances of the case, the Court has no reason to doubt that the applicants’ objection to both military and alternative service was motivated by their religious beliefs, which were genuinely held and were in serious and insurmountable conflict with their obligation to perform such service. Accordingly, Article 9 is applicable to the applicants’ case.",
            "001-177429\n59: The Government further submitted that the present case was to be distinguished from the Bayatyan case, since the applicants in the present case had had the possibility of substituting military service with alternative service of a civilian nature. Nevertheless, taking into account the shift in the case-law brought about by the Bayatyan judgment and a number of opinions and recommendations of various international bodies, including the Venice Commission, the domestic law had been amended on 2 May 2013 in order to provide a possibility for those who objected not only to the carrying of arms or performing other military activities but also to serving under any type of military command in general. In conclusion, there had been no interference with the applicants’ right to freedom of thought, conscience or religion and there had been no violation of Article 9 of the Convention.",
            "001-177429\n56: The applicants alleged that the alternative labour service was not of a genuinely civilian nature, referring to the arguments raised in that connection in their appeals (see paragraph 21 above). Although the physical work of an alternative labour serviceman was technically performed at a civilian institution, everything about that programme and all the activities of the serviceman were under military control and supervision. The military authorities could transfer an alternative labour serviceman at will to another assignment. He was required to be at his place of assignment twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and was ordered to wear a uniform provided by the military authorities, which was similar in appearance to a military uniform. The cover of the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet bore the military insignia and once his service had been completed he would be discharged and registered in the military reserve. Any violation of the prescribed procedure gave rise to sanctions in accordance with military rules and any orders given to an alternative labour serviceman were to be implemented in accordance with a procedure prescribed by the Act Establishing the Internal Rules of Service in the Armed Forces. Alternative labour servicemen were at all times subject to military authority and discipline. Thus, it could not be said that the alternative labour service contained only a few formal elements of military supervision, as the Government claimed (see paragraph 58 below). In fact, from the perspective of religious conscience, it was the same as unarmed military service."

                "CASE OF Z.A. AND OTHERS v. RUSSIA; § 1: The case originated in four applications (nos. 61411/15, 61420/15, 61427/15 and 3028/16) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Z.A., an Iraqi national, Mr M.B., who holds a passport issued by the Palestinian Authority, Mr A.M., a Somalian national and Mr Hasan Yasien, a Syrian national (“the applicants”) on 12 December 2015 (the first three applications) and 14 January 2016 (the latter application). The President of the Grand Chamber acceded to the first three applicants’ request not to have their names disclosed (Rule 47 § 4 of the Rules of Court).\n2: The applicants were represented by Ms E. Davidyan, Ms D. Trenina, and Mr K. Zharinov, lawyers practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.\n3: The applicants complained under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention that they had been unlawfully detained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport pending examination of their asylum applications. Relying on Article 3 of the Convention, they further complained that the conditions of their detention had been inadequate.\n4: The applications were allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). A Chamber of that Section composed of Helena Jäderblom, Branko Lubarda, Helen Keller, Dmitry Dedov, Pere Pastor Vilanova, Alena Poláčková, Georgios A. Serghides, judges, and also of Stephen Phillips, Section Registrar, delivered a judgment on 28 March 2017. The Court unanimously joined the applications and declared them admissible and held, by a majority, that there had been violations of Article 5 § 1 and Article 3 of the Convention. The dissenting opinion of Judge Dedov was annexed to the judgment.\n5: On 27 June 2017 the Government requested the referral of the cases to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention. On 18 September 2017 the panel of the Grand Chamber granted that request.\n6: The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 26 §§ 4 and 5 of the Convention and Rule 24 of the Rules of Court. The President of the Court decided that, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present case and the case of Ilias and Ahmed v. Hungary (application no. 47287/15) should be assigned to the same composition of the Grand Chamber (Rules 24, 42 § 2 and 71).\n7: The applicants and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 § 1) on the merits.\n8: In addition, third-party comments were received from the Hungarian Government, which had been given leave by the President of the Grand Chamber to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 3). Third-party comments received in the course of the proceedings before the Chamber from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which had been granted leave by the President of the Third Section to intervene in the written procedure in application no. 3028/16, were included in the file before the Grand Chamber.\n9: A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 18 April 2018 (Rule 59 § 3).\n10: The applicants found themselves staying in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow. Certain details of the factual circumstances of the case are in dispute between the parties, as indicated below.\n11: Mr Z.A. is an Iraqi national who was born in 1987.\n12: Following threats from an Islamic State militant group, the applicant left Iraq for Turkey on a single-entry transit tourist visa received in Mosul on 11 May 2014. According to the applicant, he fled Iraq on 12 June 2014; according to the Government, he moved to Turkey by car on 27 June 2014.\n13: According to the Government, Mr Z.A. spent a year in Turkey seeking employment, but did not apply for refugee status there. According to the applicant, he unsuccessfully applied for asylum in Turkey in June 2014 and moved to China in June 2015, where he had no opportunity to seek asylum.\n14: On 24 July 2015 Mr Z.A. travelled by air from Shanghai to Ankara via Moscow. The Turkish authorities denied him entry because he had no visa. The applicant was sent to Moscow on 27 July 2015. On arrival at Sheremetyevo Airport on the same day, he was not allowed to pass through passport control. The Russian Border Guard Service of the Federal Security Service (“the BGS”) seized his passport.\n15: Mr M.B., who was born in 1988, holds a passport issued by the Palestinian Authority.\n16: On 19 April 2013 the applicant left Gaza by car and arrived in Cairo, Egypt, on 20 April 2013. According to the Government, he did not apply for refugee status in Egypt.\n17: On 22 April 2013 Mr M.B. left Egypt and arrived in Moscow holding a business visa valid from 16 April 2013 to 25 February 2014. On 23 April 2013 he arrived in Irkutsk where he resided with his uncle and found casual jobs. After his visa expired, Mr M.B. stayed in Irkutsk.\n18: On 18 August 2015 a Russian court found Mr M.B. guilty of a breach of the migration rules and ordered his expulsion. The parties have not submitted a copy of the judgment of 18 August 2015, nor have they specified the name of the court that delivered it.\n19: On 21 August 2015 the applicant took a flight from Russia to the Gaza Strip via Cairo. However, given that the crossing point in Rafah was closed, he was held for two days in the transit zone of Cairo Airport and then sent back to Moscow.\n20: Mr M.B. arrived at Sheremetyevo Airport on 23 August 2015. As he did not have a visa, he was denied entry into Russia. The BGS seized his passport.\n21: Mr A.M. is a Somalian national who was born in 1981.\n22: In 2005 the applicant moved from Somalia, where he had worked as a journalist, to Yemen, and was granted refugee status there. In 2010 he went back to Somalia and worked as a journalist for a national TV channel in Mogadishu.\n23: In the applicant’s submission, on 20 September 2012 members of the militant group Al-Shabaab carried out a terrorist attack next to the TV channel’s office to coerce its journalists into broadcasting extrajudicial killings that the group performed. As the applicant refused to obey them, his family was taken hostage. On 23 September 2012 one of the applicant’s sons, aged seven, was killed, and another received a blow as a result of which he was paralysed. The applicant himself was beaten and tortured. Eventually Mr A.M. and his remaining family managed to escape. In September 2012 the applicant again fled to Yemen. On 16 September 2012 he obtained a temporary residence permit valid until 15 September 2014. A copy of the Yemeni residence permit shows that it was issued on 16 September 2012 in Sana’a, Yemen. The applicant has provided no explanation for the discrepancy in dates regarding the terrorist attack of 20 September 2012 and the attack on his family of 23 September 2012.\n24: In August 2014 Mr A.M. obtained Yemeni nationality and a Yemeni passport. In March 2015 the applicant decided to go to Cuba and apply for asylum there because of a personal conflict and the escalation of hostilities in Yemen.\n25: In the Government’s submission, at the end of 2012 the applicant went to Yemen and set up a business there. Later the applicant had to move to Cuba because his former business partner had allegedly threatened him and kidnapped his wife.\n26: On 12 March 2015 Mr A.M. travelled by air to Havana, Cuba. The journey consisted of three legs: Sana’a to Istanbul, Istanbul to Moscow and Moscow to Havana. On 13 March 2015 the applicant, who was in possession of a Russian transit visa, landed in Moscow for the first time. He then continued his journey to Havana.\n27: The applicant had a valid one-month Cuban visa. According to the applicant, he requested asylum immediately upon arrival in Cuba but was not allowed to enter the country. His asylum request was not processed. Mr A.M. took a flight to Quito, Ecuador, where he unsuccessfully requested asylum and was denied entry into the country and access to the asylum procedure. The applicant was sent back to Cuba, where he was detained in a special detention facility for aliens.\n28: On 9 April 2015 the applicant was deported from Cuba to Russia.\n29: On 10 April 2015 the applicant arrived at Sheremetyevo Airport. He was not allowed to pass through passport control. The BGS seized his passport.\n30: Mr Hasan Yasien is a Syrian national who was born in 1975.\n31: In 2004 and 2008 the applicant stayed in Russia for several months on business visas.\n32: According to the applicant, in 2011 he left Syria for Lebanon because of the hostilities and unsuccessfully applied for temporary asylum there. Nine months later he returned to Syria to renew his passport. In June 2014 he left for Lebanon. On 11 June 2014 he obtained a Russian business visa valid until 25 August 2014 from the Russian embassy in Beirut.\n33: On 4 July 2014 Mr Yasien arrived in Moscow from Beirut. After his business visa expired he remained in Russia.\n34: On 8 September 2014 the Noginsk City Court of the Moscow Region (“the Noginsk Court”) found the applicant guilty of a breach of the migration rules and ordered his expulsion.\n35: On 10 September 2014 Mr Yasien applied to the Moscow City Department of the Federal Migration Service (“the Moscow City FMS”) for temporary asylum. That application was refused on 8 December 2014. The applicant did not appeal against the refusal and remained in Russia.\n36: On 17 August 2015 the Noginsk Court again found the applicant guilty of a breach of the migration rules and ordered his expulsion.\n37: On 18 August 2015 the applicant took a flight from Moscow to Antalya, Turkey. The BGS seized his passport and handed it over to the aircraft crew. The Turkish authorities denied the applicant entry into the country and sent him back to Moscow, on 20 August 2015 according to the applicant and on 21 August 2015 according to the Government. Upon the applicant’s arrival in Moscow, the Russian authorities sent him back to Antalya. The Turkish authorities then returned the applicant to Moscow.\n38: On 8 September 2015 the applicant took a flight to Beirut, but the Lebanese authorities denied him entry into the country and sent him back to Moscow.\n39: On 9 September 2015 Mr Yasien arrived at Sheremetyevo Airport. The BSG did not allow him to pass through passport control and seized his passport.\n40: The applicants described the conditions of their stay in the airport transit zone as follows.\n41: They had slept on a mattress on the floor in the boarding area of the airport, which had been constantly lit, crowded and noisy. There had been no showers readily available to them in the transit area. The only shower that was free of charge was located in the room for detainees and had been locked. Access to it had been conditional upon permission of the BGS officers, who had allowed the applicants to use it and provided them with the key several times during the first week of their stay.\n42: The applicants had not had access to fresh air and had not been able to take any outdoor exercise. They had not had access to a notary, which had precluded them from issuing notarised powers of attorney required under Russian law to appoint a representative who could communicate with the public authorities on their behalf, or to medical, legal, social or postal services. All their requests for medical assistance had been dismissed; medical personnel had not been allowed to visit the applicants in the transit zone.\n43: The applicants had not been in possession of their passports throughout the duration of their stay. The BGS officers had seized each applicant’s passport upon their arrival and had handed them to the aircraft crews only when the applicants were about to take a flight out of Sheremetyevo Airport.\n44: The applicants’ access to a lawyer had remained within the discretion of the BGS officers on duty in the transit zone and “[had] never [been] guaranteed”. All meetings of the applicants with the lawyers who had been introduced to them by the Russian office of the UNHCR had taken place in the presence of two or three BGS officers.\n45: In their written observations and oral submissions before the Grand Chamber, the Government did not provide any description of the material conditions of the applicants’ stay in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport.\n46: On 29 July 2015 Mr Z.A. applied for refugee status in Russia through the BGS.\n47: According to the applicant, about one month after that date the BGS officers had “forced [him] to rewrite his application changing the date of the initial request to the current one”, threatening him with expulsion to Iraq in order “to conceal their failure” to transmit the request to the Federal Migration Authority within three days.\n48: On 17 September 2015 Mr Z.A. was interviewed in the airport transit zone by officers of the Moscow Regional Department of the Federal Migration Service (“the Moscow Region FMS”).\n49: On 23 September 2015 the application for refugee status was accepted for examination on the merits. According to the applicant, the Moscow Region FMS did not issue him with an examination certificate (see paragraphs 99-100 below). According to the Government, an examination certificate was issued on 23 September 2015. The Government have enclosed a copy of the decision to issue a certificate but no copy of the document itself.\n50: On 10 November 2015 the Moscow Region FMS dismissed Mr Z.A.’s request for asylum on the grounds that “the reason why the applicant left [Iraq] and why he is reluctant to return there is not in order to seek asylum but economic considerations and a difficult social and economic situation on the territory of [Iraq].” They concluded that the applicant had not put forward convincing reasons why he personally feared persecution. The applicant was notified accordingly on 14 November 2015. On 1 December 2015 the applicant’s lawyer requested the Moscow Region FMS to issue Mr Z.A. with an examination certificate and to assign him to a temporary accommodation centre.\n51: On 3 December 2015 the applicant appealed to the Federal Migration Service of Russia (“the Russian FMS”), which, at the material time, prior to its dissolution by the Presidential Decree of 5 April 2016, served as the higher migration authority. He requested that the Russian FMS overrule the decision of 10 November 2015, issue him with an examination certificate, and assign him to a centre for the temporary detention of aliens.\n52: On 29 December 2015 the Russian FMS dismissed the applicant’s appeal.\n53: On 1 February 2016 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decisions of 10 November and 29 December 2015 with the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow (“the Basmannyy Court”).\n54: On 5 February 2016 the UNHCR recognised the applicant as a person in need of international protection and started a resettlement procedure.\n55: On 17 March 2016, having been resettled by UNHCR, the applicant left for Denmark.\n56: On 12 May 2016 the Basmannyy Court upheld the Russian FMS’s decision. On the same date the applicant’s lawyer lodged a brief statement of appeal (краткая апелляционная жалоба), pending receipt of a reasoned judgment in written form. Subsequently the Basmannyy Court discontinued the proceedings on the grounds that the applicant’s lawyer could not obtain a notarised authority form following the resettlement.\n57: Three weeks after his arrival at Sheremetyevo Airport the applicant applied for refugee status in Russia through the BGS. Neither party has submitted the exact date; if calculated from 23 August 2015, the date of Mr M.B.’s arrival at Sheremetyevo Airport, the date would fall on 13 September 2015.\n58: On 14 November 2015 the Moscow Region FMS officers interviewed Mr M.B. in the airport transit zone.\n59: On 20 November 2015 Mr M.B.’s application for refugee status was accepted for examination on the merits. According to the Government, an examination certificate was issued on the same date. The Government have enclosed a copy of the decision to issue a certificate but no copy of the document itself. According to the applicant, the Moscow Region FMS did not provide Mr M.B. with such a certificate.\n60: On 1 December 2015 the applicant’s lawyer requested the Moscow Region FMS to issue Mr M.B. with an examination certificate and to assign him to a temporary accommodation centre.\n61: On the same date the Moscow Region FMS dismissed Mr M.B.’s application for refugee status on the grounds that “the reason why the applicant left Palestine and why he is reluctant to return there is not in order to seek asylum but the poor social and economic situation in the territory of Palestine.” They concluded that the applicant had not put forward convincing reasons why he personally feared persecution.\n62: On 21 December 2015 the applicant’s lawyer appealed to the Russian FMS. On 31 December 2015 the Russian FMS dismissed the appeal.\n63: On 1 February 2016 the applicant lodged an appeal against the Russian FMS’s decision with the Basmannyy Court.\n64: On 13 February 2016 the Egyptian authorities opened the Rafah crossing point to Gaza. The applicant agreed to take a flight to Egypt and left the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport.\n65: On 12 May 2016 the Basmannyy Court upheld the Russian FMS’s decision. The applicant’s lawyer lodged a brief statement of appeal on the same date, pending receipt of a reasoned judgment in written form. Later, the Basmannyy Court discontinued the proceedings on the grounds that the applicant’s lawyer could not obtain a notarised authority form following the departure and thus could not lodge a detailed statement of appeal.\n66: The applicant applied for refugee status in Russia through the BGS (according to the applicant, on 10 April 2015; according to the Government, on 11 April 2015).\n67: On 1 July 2015 the Moscow Region FMS interviewed the applicant in the airport transit zone.\n68: In the applicant’s submission, on 1 July 2015 his application was accepted for examination on the merits. However, he was not issued with an examination certificate. In the Government’s submission, an examination certificate was issued on 7 July 2015. The Government have enclosed a copy of the decision to issue a certificate but no copy of the document itself.\n69: On 1 October 2015 the Moscow Region FMS dismissed the application for refugee status on the grounds that the applicant’s family had continued living in Somalia without being persecuted and that he had worked in Yemen. They concluded that the applicant had not left Somalia for any of the reasons listed in Federal Law FZ-4528-1 of 19 February 1993 (with amendments, hereinafter “the Refugees Act”), and thus could be deported there. The applicant was informed accordingly on 3 November 2015, but claimed that he had not been served with a copy of the decision rejecting his application.\n70: On 24 November 2015 Mr A.M. appealed against the decision of 1 October 2015 to the Russian FMS.\n71: On 1 December 2015 the applicant’s lawyer requested the Moscow Region FMS to issue Mr A.M. with an examination certificate and to assign him to a temporary accommodation centre.\n72: On 7 December 2015 the Russian FMS dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 1 October 2015 on the grounds that he had been unwilling to return to Yemen because of threats from a third person but nothing prevented him from returning to Somalia in the absence of convincing claims of persecution there. It also noted that the applicant had expressed his readiness to go to Somalia.\n73: On 15 December 2015 Mr A.M. applied for temporary asylum through the BGS.\n74: On 29 December 2015 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Basmannyy Court against the Russian FMS’s decision of 7 December 2015 rejecting his application for refugee status.\n75: On 22 December 2015 the Moscow Region FMS refused the application for temporary asylum as unsubstantiated on the grounds that the applicant had applied for it merely in order to legitimise his situation in Russia. The applicant was notified accordingly, on 25 December 2015 according to the Government and on 28 December 2015 according to the applicant.\n76: On 10 February 2016 the Russian FMS rejected an appeal against the Moscow Region FMS’s decision of 22 December 2015 regarding temporary asylum on the grounds that the applicant had been unwilling to return to Yemen because of the threats from a third person but nothing prevented him from returning to Somalia in the absence of convincing claims of persecution there. They also noted that the applicant had expressed his readiness to go to Somalia.\n77: On 24 February 2016 the UNHCR recognised the applicant as a person in need of international protection.\n78: On 19 May 2016 the Basmannyy Court dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant on 11 March 2016 against the decisions of the Moscow Region FMS and the Russian FMS dismissing his application for temporary asylum. It reasoned, in particular, that the applicant had not proved that the terrorists who had threatened him in 2005 represented any danger more than ten years later and that, should such threats persist, he “ha[d] not been deprived of an opportunity to avail himself of the protection of his State of nationality [that is to say] to apply to the law-enforcement agencies of the Republic of Somalia [for protection].” The applicant’s lawyer appealed against the judgment on 31 May 2016.\n79: On 12 September 2016 the Basmannyy Court upheld the Russian FMS’s decision of 7 December 2015 concerning the application for refugee status.\n80: On 20 September 2016 the Moscow City Court dismissed his appeal against the Basmannyy Court’s judgment of 19 May 2016 concerning the application for temporary asylum on the grounds that the situation in Somalia had not changed since the applicant’s application for refugee status had been rejected, and that there were no humanitarian grounds that would warrant granting him temporary asylum. It was also noted that the applicant had abused his right to apply to court by trying to circumvent the legal procedure for legitimising his situation in Russia.\n81: On 6 February 2017 the Moscow City Court dismissed his appeal against the Basmannyy Court’s judgment of 12 September 2016 concerning the application for refugee status on the grounds that the applicant had not needed asylum at the moment of “crossing the State border of the Russian Federation” because he had not provided proof of the existence of a real threat in the event of his return to Somalia.\n82: According to the applicant, having received the final rejections of his applications for refugee status and temporary asylum from the Russian authorities, he decided that he did not have any chance of obtaining asylum in Russia and informed the BGS that he agreed to leave for Mogadishu, Somalia. On 9 March 2017 the UNHCR obtained the agreement of Turkish Airlines to provide Mr A.M. with a ticket to Mogadishu via Istanbul. The officers of the Federal Security Service escorted the applicant to Vnukovo Airport of Moscow, ensured that he boarded the aircraft and handed his passport over to the crew. Since then the applicant has resided in Mogadishu, where he has abandoned journalism “to escape the attention of the terrorists”.\n83: According to the Government, Mr Yasien applied for temporary asylum on 19 September 2015.\n84: According to the applicant, on that date he applied for refugee status through the BGS. His application was allegedly lost. The applicant lodged a new application for refugee status on 5 October 2015.\n85: On 3 November 2015 the Moscow Region FMS interviewed the applicant in the airport transit zone.\n86: According to the applicant, the Moscow Region FMS accepted his application for examination on the merits on 3 November 2015 but did not provide him with an examination certificate. In his submission, it was a wellestablished practice of the migration authorities to issue, but not deliver, examination certificates to detained asylum-seekers. The certificates of asylum-seekers in detention were kept at the migration service office together with the case files.\n87: On 1 December 2015 the applicant’s lawyer requested the Moscow Region FMS to issue Mr Yasien with an examination certificate and to assign him to a temporary accommodation centre.\n88: On 21 December 2015 the Moscow Region FMS dismissed Mr Yasien’s application for temporary asylum although the applicant had applied for refugee status, not temporary asylum. The grounds for rejection were as follows: the applicant’s economic situation in Syria had been unsatisfactory so he had left the country for economic reasons, and he had applied for temporary asylum to legitimise his situation in Russia in order to have an opportunity to work there. The applicant was notified accordingly, on 23 December 2015 according to the applicant and on 25 December 2015 according to the Government. According to the applicant, he was not served with a copy of the decision.\n89: On 29 December 2015 Mr Yasien again submitted his application for refugee status through the BGS.\n90: On 12 January 2016 the applicant appealed, through his lawyer, against the decision of 21 December 2015 to the Russian FMS. He emphasised that on 19 September and 5 October 2015 he had applied for refugee status, while the decision in question concerned temporary asylum, and that for unknown reasons the Moscow Region FMS had substituted the temporary asylum procedure for the refugee status procedure. The applicant referred to the grave humanitarian crisis in Syria and submitted that, in breach of the Refugees Act, the Moscow Region FMS had not issued him with an examination certificate.\n91: On 4 February 2016 the Russian FMS dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of 21 December 2015. It noted, in particular, that there were regular flights from Moscow to Damascus, from where Syrian nationals could travel to other parts of the country under the control of the Government of Syria, and that “many Syrians wish[ed] to leave the country not only because of a fear for their lives but, in large part, because of the worsening economic and humanitarian situation”. The Russian FMS did not address the applicant’s argument regarding the replacement of the refugee status procedure with the one for temporary asylum.\n92: On 7 April 2016 the applicant once again lodged an application for refugee status through the BGS. He received no response.\n93: On 11 April 2016 the applicant complained to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow (“the Zamoskvoretskiy Court”) about the decisions of 21 December 2015 and 4 February 2016 and the inaction of the Russian FMS.\n94: On 21 April 2016 the UNHCR recognised the applicant as a person in need of international protection and started a resettlement procedure.\n95: On 11 May 2016 the applicant was resettled by the UNHCR and left for Sweden.\n96: On 31 August 2016 the Zamoskvoretskiy Court upheld the Russian FMS’s decision of 4 February 2016.\n97: Section 6 of the Federal Law on Exit from and Entry into the Territory of the Russian Federation (FZ-114 of 15 August 1996, with amendments), in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n98: Section 14 of the State Border of the Russian Federation Act (FZ4730-1 of 1 April 1993, with amendments), in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n99: Section 4 of the Refugees Act provides, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n100: Section 6 of the Refugees Act reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n101: Article 31 of the 1951 Convention reads as follows:\n102: Article 33 of the 1951 Convention provides:\n103: According to the survey of the situation of asylum-seekers confined to a transit zone on the territory of a State pending the outcome of asylum proceedings in thirty-four Contracting Parties to the Convention made available to the Court, in seven of the thirty-four member States surveyed, namely the Czech Republic, France, Lithuania, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal and Ukraine, the stay in a transit zone of persons who have applied for international protection is regarded under national law as a deprivation of liberty, whereas under the national law of eighteen of the thirty-four Contracting Parties, namely Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, North Macedonia, Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom (England and Wales), such stay is not regarded as a deprivation of liberty.\n104: In nine of the thirty-four Contracting Parties, namely Armenia, Belgium, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, San Marino, Slovakia and Sweden, there are no transit zones in either legal or practical terms in which asylum-seekers are confined pending the outcome of their asylum proceedings.\n105: Twelve of the thirty-four Contracting Parties, namely Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Georgia, Greece, Lithuania, Montenegro, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania and Spain, have in place legal provisions and procedures specifically applicable to persons who have applied for international protection while in a transit zone at an airport or at a land or sea border point.\n106: The applicants complained that their confinement in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport had amounted to an unlawful deprivation of liberty, in breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n107: The Chamber declared the complaint under Article 5 § 1 admissible and found that the applicants’ confinement in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport had amounted to a de facto deprivation of liberty.\n108: The Chamber further examined the issue of lawfulness of the applicants’ de facto deprivation of liberty. In the absence of any reference by the Government to any domestic legal provision capable of serving as a legal basis, the Chamber considered that the applicants’ lengthy confinement in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport had not had any legal basis in the domestic law, in breach of the requirement of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, and found a violation of that provision.\n109: The applicants submitted that while in the airport transit zone they had been in the situation of asylum-seekers whose applications had not yet been considered. They had not had the option of entering a State other than the one they had fled and had been under the jurisdiction of Russia. During their lengthy stay in the airport transit zone they had been unable to enter Russian territory or receive visits from doctors and notaries; access to them by their lawyers had been conditional and occasionally denied; and the BGS had seized their passports. Accordingly, the applicants had not chosen to stay in the transit zone and thus could not be said to have validly consented to being deprived of their liberty. They concluded that their confinement in the transit zone had amounted to a de facto deprivation of liberty.\n110: Regarding the compatibility of their de facto deprivation of liberty with Article 5 § 1, the applicants submitted that there had been no court or other official decision authorising their respective detention. In the absence of any legal procedure to assess the lawfulness or duration of their detention, the applicants had been “in a legal vacuum.” They concluded that their lengthy confinement in the airport transit zone for an indefinite and unforeseeable period in the absence of a specific legal provision justifying it and of judicial authorisation or review had not had any basis in domestic law, in breach of Article 5 § 1.\n111: The applicants submitted that the subject of their complaint before the Court was not the Russian authorities’ refusal to grant them asylum. The thrust of their respective applications was “that their rights [had been] violated by the absence of legal regulations and by the authorities’ violation of the regulations that should have applied and their complete lack of consideration or intention to preserve human dignity.”\n112: The applicants stated that they had lodged applications for refugee status and temporary asylum in compliance with Russian domestic law despite the lack of information about the procedure available in the airport transit zone and the fact that the BGS officers had only spoken Russian. The Russian authorities’ failure to treat the applicants as asylum-seekers and to provide them with examination certificates had deprived them of the opportunity to enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Refugees Act.\n113: The Government insisted that it was “vital to draw a distinction between genuine refugees and migrants”, the latter being persons moving to a third country for mainly economic reasons. In the Government’s view, the applicants had not met the refugee criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention as they had not arrived in Russia directly from the countries of the alleged risk, had not chosen it as a first safe country for the purposes of claiming asylum, had not applied for asylum in Russia immediately upon arrival there, and had not sought asylum in other countries beforehand. In the course of interviews by the Russian migration authorities, the applicants had not substantiated their allegations that their lives were endangered in the countries of origin but had referred to a poor economic situation. Allegations of possible risks had been raised only after the applicants had been put in contact with lawyers specialising in asylum cases. Accordingly, the applicants were not “genuine asylum-seekers” but “ordinary migrants” whose asylum applications had been “artificially created and had little prospects of success.”\n114: The Government submitted that they should not be deemed responsible for difficulties that had been the result of the applicants’ own choices. The Court’s position in asylum-seekers’ cases encouraged migrants “to abuse the right to asylum”.\n115: The Government insisted that a person under a State’s jurisdiction was not necessarily “at the hands of the authorities” and further stated that the applicants should have been well aware of the fact that they had not had the requisite documents and had not had valid grounds to enter Russia. By deliberately attempting to enter Russia without valid visas and grounds on which to be regarded as refugees, the applicants had breached Russian law and had validly consented to be deprived of their liberty. The fact that the Russian authorities had examined the applicants’ asylum applications did not mean they had had to stay in the airport transit zone as the prospects of success of those applications had been slim. They also referred to the margin of appreciation that States enjoyed in granting asylum. They concluded that Article 5 was inapplicable in the present case.\n116: The Government further referred to a State’s “inherent sovereign right to control the entry and residence of aliens on its territory” and submitted that the applicants’ passports had not been seized. The applicants had not been subject to expulsion, deportation or extradition proceedings; therefore, there had been no deprivation of liberty as the applicants had been free to leave Russia at any time and eventually had done so.\n117: They further submitted that if a State prohibited an alien from entering its territory, he or she was forced to leave the State. Should an applicant meeting the asylum-seeker criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention be forced to return to a country where he had been persecuted, an issue under Article 3 of the Convention could arise, but only if a relevant complaint was raised by that applicant.\n118: The Government further argued that the Court had “invented” a new right under the Convention – which did not guarantee a right to asylum – imposing an obligation on States to allow anyone claiming to be an asylum-seeker to enter its territory unimpeded. They concluded that there had been no violation of Article 5 § 1 in the present case.\n119: The UNHCR, in their submissions, addressed the Russian domestic legal framework and practice applicable to the treatment of asylum-seekers in transit zones of airports in the Russian Federation and provided its interpretation of the relevant principles of international law.\n120: Russian law did not contain any provisions addressing the grounds for or duration of stays in border areas and in transit zones or stipulating procedural safeguards for asylum-seekers at the borders; nor did it provide for the possibility of judicial review in respect of the situation of those stranded in a transit zone. The conditions of stay in airport transit zones were not regulated by domestic law. Russian law did not place responsibility on any State authority for ensuring minimum basic care for asylum-seekers in transit zones.\n121: Migration authorities had no staff in transit zones, which were under the full control of the BGS. The BGS did not make decisions to keep a person in the transit zone; rather, they simply did not allow the person to pass through passport control. They could also refuse, without giving reasons, to accept asylum applications. Asylumseekers in airport transit zones were deprived of the minimum rights guaranteed by the Refugees Act as they remained in legal limbo even after being issued with an examination certificate. They could not effectively exercise their right to appeal against a rejection at first instance of their application for refugee status.\n122: Asylum-seekers stranded in transit zones were deprived of access to fresh air, privacy, food, and access to medical and social care. The period for which an asylum-seeker had to undergo such a dire lack of basic facilities could be prolonged as on average the complete asylum procedure, including appeals, could last between one and two years.\n123: The UNHCR stated that, where applied, the detention of asylumseekers should be justified under the principles of necessity, reasonableness and proportionality, and should be subject to a series of important procedural safeguards – all of which were absent in the context of persons held in airport transit zones in the Russian Federation.\n124: The Government of Hungary argued before the Grand Chamber that there was no “right to asylum-shopping” (that is, the right to choose a country in which to seek asylum) under current international law despite the fact that the UNHCR and “other organisations promoting refugee rights” advocated it.\n125: According to the Government of Hungary, there was no right to be granted asylum. Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guaranteed the right to enjoy asylum; Article 12 § 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention proclaimed the right to leave one’s own country. Yet no right to admission to a country for the purposes of seeking asylum was recognised in international law. Asylum-shopping benefitted international organised crime and escalated the European “migration crisis.” The Convention did not “confer a right of admission to the territory and thus the full jurisdiction of the State”. The threshold for the application of Articles 3 and 5 and their standards left “ample room for interpretation in the light of Article 1 of the Convention.”\n126: The Court takes note of the concerns expressed by the Russian and Hungarian Governments in their submissions and agrees that the present case must be seen in the context of the practical, administrative, budgetary and legal challenges that the member States face as a consequence of the influx of refugees and immigrants. However, contrary to the Russian and Hungarian Governments’ submissions before the Grand Chamber, in the Court’s view this case has little to do with the issue of whether a right to asylum as such or a right to asylumshopping exist under current international law.\n127: The thrust of the Chamber’s findings was not the fact that none of the applicants had been granted asylum in Russia but the absence of a legal basis for their lengthy confinement in the airport transit area and the failure to take care of their essential needs pending the examination of their asylum applications. The Court would reiterate that the Convention has been created to set minimum standards. The right to have one’s liberty restricted only in accordance with the law and the right to humane conditions, if detained under State control, are minimum guarantees that should be available to those under the jurisdiction of all member States, despite the mounting “migration crisis” in Europe.\n128: Accordingly, the Court’s task in the present case is to verify the respondent Government’s compliance with these Convention obligations.\n129: The first issue to be addressed is whether the applicants fell within Russian jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention. The Court notes in this connection that during the events at issue the applicants were physically present on the territory of Russia and found themselves under the control of the Russian authorities.\n130: The Court reiterates that an airport, including an international airport, located on the territory of a State is legally part of the territory of that State (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, §§ 41 and 43-45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III; Shamsa v. Poland, nos. 45355/99 and 45357/99, § 45, 27 November 2003; Riad and Idiab v. Belgium, nos. 29787/03 and 29810/03, § 68, 24 January 2008; Rashed v. the Czech Republic, no. 298/07, § 70, 27 November 2008; and Abou Amer v. Romania, no. 14521/03, § 39, 24 May 2011).\n131: It is noteworthy that the Russian Government did not deny before the Grand Chamber that the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport was part of Russian territory; nor did they dispute that the applicants were under the control of the authorities throughout the relevant period (see paragraph 115 above).\n132: The Court concludes that the applicants were within the jurisdiction of Russia during the events of the present case.\n133: In proclaiming the “right to liberty”, paragraph 1 of Article 5 contemplates the physical liberty of the person. Accordingly, it is not concerned with mere restrictions on liberty of movement, which are governed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task, in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends (see Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 16483/12, § 64, 15 December 2016, with further references).\n134: In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5, the starting-point must be his or her specific situation in reality and account must be taken of a whole range of factors such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 225, ECHR 2012, and Gahramanov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), no. 26291/06, § 40, 15 October 2013). The difference between deprivation and restriction of liberty is one of degree or intensity and not one of nature or substance (see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, § 80, 23 February 2017, with further references; see also Kasparov v. Russia, no. 53659/07, § 36, 11 October 2016).\n135: The Court considers that in drawing the distinction between a restriction on liberty of movement and deprivation of liberty in the context of confinement of asylum-seekers, its approach should be practical and realistic, having regard to the present-day conditions and challenges. It is important in particular to recognise the States’ right, subject to their international obligations, to control their borders and to take measures against foreigners circumventing restrictions on immigration.\n136: The question whether staying at airport international zones amounts to deprivation of liberty has been dealt with in a number of cases (see, among those: Amuur, cited above, § 43; Shamsa, cited above, § 47; Mogoş v. Romania (dec.), no. 20420/02, 6 May 2004; Mahdid and Haddar v. Austria (dec.), no. 74762/01, ECHR 2005-XIII (extracts); Riad and Idiab, cited above, § 68; Nolan and K. v. Russia, no. 2512/04, §§ 93-96, 12 February 2009; and Gahramanov, cited above, §§ 35-47).\n137: The Court stated the following in the case of Amuur, at § 43:\n138: In determining the distinction between a restriction on liberty of movement and deprivation of liberty in the context of confinement of foreigners in airport transit zones and reception centres for the identification and registration of migrants, the factors taken into consideration by the Court may be summarised as follows: i) the applicants’ individual situation and their choices, ii) the applicable legal regime of the respective country and its purpose, iii) the relevant duration, especially in the light of the purpose and the procedural protection enjoyed by applicants pending the events, and iv) the nature and degree of the actual restrictions imposed on or experienced by the applicants (see the cases cited in the preceding three paragraphs).\n139: The Court considers that the factors outlined above are also relevant, mutatis mutandis, in the present case.\n140: The Court observes that all four applicants entered the airport involuntarily, but without any involvement of the Russian authorities, either because they had been denied entry into the country they wanted to go to or because they had been deported to Russia. Compelled by the circumstances, they all decided to seek asylum in Russia. While this fact in itself does not exclude the possibility of the applicants finding themselves in a situation of de facto deprivation of liberty after having entered, the Court considers that it is a relevant consideration, to be looked at in the light of all other circumstances of the case.\n141: It is true that in a number of cases the Court stated that detention might violate Article 5 of the Convention even though the person concerned had agreed to it and emphasised that the right to liberty is too important for a person to lose the benefit of the protection of the Convention for the single reason that he gave himself up to be taken into detention (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 18 June 1971, § 65, Series A no. 12; I.I. v. Bulgaria, no. 44082/98, §§ 84-87, 9 June 2005; Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, § 48, 9 November 2010; Venskutė v. Lithuania, no. 10645/08, § 72, 11 December 2012; and Buzadji v. Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, §§ 106-10, 5 July 2016). Those cases, however, concerned situations where the law provided for deprivation of liberty or situations where the applicants had complied with an obligation, such as, among others, to enter a prison or a police station or submit to house arrest. The circumstances are not the same, in the Court’s view, where the applicants – as in the present case – had no relevant prior link to the State concerned and no obligation to which they acquiesced but requested admission to that State’s territory of their own initiative and sought asylum there. In such cases the starting point regarding the applicants’ individual position vis-à-vis the authorities is entirely different.\n142: In the present case, having regard to the known facts about the applicants and their respective journeys and, notably, the fact that they did not arrive in Russia because of a direct and immediate danger for their life or health but rather due to specific circumstances of their travel routes, there is no doubt that they entered the Sheremetyevo airport involuntarily, but without the Russian authorities being involved. It is therefore clear that, at all events, the Russian authorities were entitled to do the necessary verifications and examine their claims before deciding whether or not to admit them.\n143: Second, it is also relevant that the rationale and purpose of the domestic legal regime applicable to the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone was to put in place a waiting area while the authorities decided whether to formally admit the asylum-seekers to Russia (see paragraphs 99 and 100 above). Albeit not decisive in itself, it is relevant to note that the Russian authorities did not seek to deprive the applicants of their liberty and that they denied them entry at once (see paragraphs 14, 20, 29 and 39 above). The applicants remained in the transit zone essentially because they awaited the outcome of their asylum proceedings (see paragraphs 46-96 above).\n144: The right of States to control the entry of foreigners into their territory necessarily implies that admission authorisation may be conditional on compliance with relevant requirements. Therefore, absent other significant factors, the situation of an individual applying for entry and waiting for a short period for the verification of his or her right to enter cannot be described as deprivation of liberty imputable to the State, since in such cases the State authorities have undertaken vis-à-vis the individual no other steps than reacting to his or her wish to enter by carrying out the necessary verifications (see, mutatis mutandis, Gahramanov, cited above, §§ 35-47; see also Mahdid and Haddar, cited above, where the applicants’ asylum requests were dismissed in an airport transit zone within three days and the Court found that there had been no deprivation of liberty (taking into consideration additional factors, such as that the applicants were not under constant police control).\n145: It is further relevant whether, in line with the purpose of the applicable legal regime, procedural guarantees concerning the processing of the applicants’ asylum claims and domestic provisions fixing the maximum duration of their stay in the transit zone existed and whether they were applied in the present case.\n146: On the facts, the Court notes that the respondent Government were unable to point at any domestic provisions fixing the maximum duration of the applicants’ stay in the transit zone and that furthermore in disregard of the Russian domestic rules granting every asylum-seeker the right to be issued with an examination certificate and to be placed in temporary accommodation facilities pending examination of the asylum application (see paragraphs 99 and 100 above; compare Riad and Idiab, cited above, § 101), the applicants were essentially left to their own devices in the transit zone. The Russian authorities did not acknowledge that they were in any manner responsible for the applicants, thereby leaving the latter in a legal limbo without any possibility of challenging the measures restricting their liberty (see paragraph 44 above). While in the transit zone, all four applicants had little information regarding the outcome of their respective applications for refugee status and temporary asylum (see paragraphs 41-44 above).\n147: In the Court’s case-law concerning confinement of aliens in an immigration context, the duration of the relevant restriction on movement and the link between the actions of the authorities and the restricted freedom may be elements affecting the classification of the situation as amounting to deprivation of liberty or not (see, mutatis mutandis, Amuur, cited above, § 43; Gahramanov, cited above, §§ 35-47; and Mahdid and Haddar, cited above). However, as long as the applicant’s stay in the transit zone does not exceed significantly the time needed for the examination of an asylum request and there are no exceptional circumstances, the duration in itself should not affect the Court’s analysis on the applicability of Article 5 in a decisive manner. That is particularly so where the individuals, while waiting for the processing of their asylum claims, benefitted from procedural rights and safeguards against excessive waiting periods. The presence of domestic legal regulation limiting the length of stay in the transit zone is of significant importance in this regard.\n148: In the present case the processing and subsequent judicial examination of the applicants’ respective cases was anything but speedy, as Mr Z.A. spent seven months and nineteen days in the transit zone awaiting the outcome of his asylum proceedings (see paragraphs 46-55 above); Mr M.B. five months and one day (see paragraphs 57-64 above); Mr A.M. one year, nine months and at least twenty-eight days (see paragraph 66-82 above); and Mr Yasien seven months and twenty-two days (see paragraphs 83-95 above). The Court thus considers that the applicants’ situation was very seriously influenced by delays and inactions of the Russian authorities which were clearly attributable to them and were not justified by any legitimate reasons.\n149: The Court would add that the case file contains no indication that the applicants in the present case failed to comply with the legal regulations in place or did not act in good faith at any time during their confinement in the transit zone or at any stage of the domestic legal proceedings by, for instance, complicating the examination of their asylum cases (see, by contrast, Mahdid and Haddar, cited above, where the applicants remained in the international zone of an airport after the rejection of their request for asylum and destroyed their documents in an attempt to force the Austrian authorities to accept them).\n150: The individuals staying at the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone were not permitted to leave in the direction of the remaining territory of Russia, the country where the zone was located (compare and contrast Mogoş, cited above). This is unsurprising having regard to the very purpose of the transit zone as a waiting area while the authorities decided whether to formally admit asylum-seekers to Russia.\n151: The Court further observes, and this was not in dispute between the parties, that even though the applicants were largely left to their own devices within the perimeter of the transit zone, the restrictions on their liberty were nevertheless substantial given that the whole area was under the permanent control of the BSG, a branch of the FSB. The Court finds that, overall, the size of the area and the manner in which it was controlled were such that the applicants’ freedom of movement was restricted to a very significant degree, in a manner similar to that characteristic of certain types of light regime detention facilities.\n152: The remaining question is whether the applicants could leave the transit zone in a direction other than the territory of Russia.\n153: The Court recalls its reasoning in the case of Amuur (cited above), where it stated that “the mere fact that it is possible for asylum-seekers to leave voluntarily the country where they wish to take refuge cannot exclude a restriction on liberty” and noted that the possibility to leave “becomes theoretical if no other country offering protection comparable to the protection they expect to find in the country where they are seeking asylum is inclined or prepared to take them in” (ibid., § 48).\n154: In this regard, the Court observes that unlike in land border transit zones, in this particular case leaving the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone would have required planning, contacting aviation companies, purchasing tickets and possibly applying for a visa depending on the destination. The Court considers that the Government have failed to substantiate their assertion that despite these obstacles “the applicants were free to leave Russia at any time and go wherever they wished”. The practical and real possibility for the applicants to leave the airport transit zone and do so without a direct threat for their life or health, as known by or brought to the attention of the authorities at the relevant time, must be convincingly shown to exist.\n155: In the light of this conclusion, the Court does not find it necessary to address the parties’ arguments relating to the merits of the applicants’ asylum requests. The Convention cannot be read as linking in such a manner the applicability of Article 5 to a separate issue concerning the authorities’ compliance with Article 3 (see Ilias and Ahmed [GC], no. 47287/15, §§ 244-46, 21 November 2019).\n156: The Court thus finds that, having regard in particular to the lack of any domestic legal provisions fixing the maximum duration of the applicants’ stay, the largely irregular character of the applicants’ stay in the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone, the excessive duration of such stay and considerable delays in domestic examination of the applicants’ asylum claims, the characteristics of the area in which the applicants were held and the control to which they were subjected during the relevant period of time and the fact that the applicants had no practical possibility of leaving the zone, the applicants were deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article 5. Article 5 § 1 is therefore applicable.\n157: The aim of the applicants’ deprivation of liberty was “to prevent [their] effecting an unauthorized entry into the country” and, therefore, it falls to be examined under the first limb of subparagraph Article 5 § 1 (f) (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, §§ 64-66, ECHR 2008).\n158: The first question to be addressed is whether the detention was effected “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.\n159: Article 5 § 1 of the Convention delimits the circumstances in which individuals may be lawfully deprived of their liberty, it being stressed that these circumstances must be given a narrow interpretation having regard to the fact that they constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom (see, with further references, El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, § 230, ECHR 2012).\n160: Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 67, Series A no. 94, and Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 73, Reports 1996V). It is a necessary adjunct to this right that States are permitted to detain would-be immigrants who have applied for permission to enter, whether by way of asylum or not. Deprivation of liberty of asylum-seekers to prevent their unauthorised entry into a State’s territory is not in itself in contravention with the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, §§ 6465, and Suso Musa v. Malta, no. 42337/12, §§ 89-90, 23 July 2013).\n161: Any deprivation of liberty, however, must be “in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law” that meets the “quality of law” criteria, as well as be free from arbitrariness. Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is essential that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied and therefore that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, § 92, with further references). Furthermore, the detention of a person constitutes a major interference with individual freedom and must always be subject to rigorous scrutiny.\n162: The Court is fully conscious of the difficulties that member States may face during periods of massive arrivals of asylum-seekers at their borders. Subject to the prohibition of arbitrariness, the lawfulness requirement of that provision may be considered generally satisfied by a domestic legal regime that provides, for example, for no more than the name of the authority competent to order deprivation of liberty in a transit zone, the form of the order, its possible grounds and limits, the maximum duration of the confinement and, as required by Article 5 § 4, the applicable avenue of judicial appeal.\n163: Furthermore, Article 5 § 1 (f) does not prevent States from enacting domestic law provisions that formulate the grounds on which such confinement can be ordered with due regard to the practical realities of massive influx of asylum-seekers. In particular, subparagraph 1(f) does not prohibit deprivation of liberty in a transit zone for a limited period on grounds that such confinement is generally necessary to ensure the asylum seekers’ presence pending the examination of their asylum claims or, moreover, on grounds that there is a need to examine the admissibility of asylum applications speedily and that, to that end, a structure and adapted procedures have been put in place at the transit zone (see, for a similar approach, Saadi, cited above, § 80).\n164: The Court notes the argument of the applicants and the UNHCR pointing to the lack of any legal basis for the applicants’ confinement in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport (see paragraph 110 above). It also notes that the Government essentially did not dispute that allegation (see paragraphs 113-118 above). Having examined the applicable domestic law (see paragraphs 97-100 above), the Court finds no trace of any provision of Russian law capable of serving as grounds for justifying the applicants’ deprivation of liberty. Accordingly, it concludes that in the present case there was no strictly defined statutory basis for the applicants’ detention.\n165: This in itself would be sufficient to find a violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. However, the Court would also point at the following additional factors, which further worsened the applicants’ respective situations in the present case. As transpires from the facts of the case, the applicants’ access to the asylum procedure was considerably impeded as a result of their detention, as there was no information available on asylum procedures in Russia in the transit zone and their access to legal assistance was severely restricted (see paragraphs 42-44 above).\n166: The Court next observes that the applicants experienced serious delays when attempting to submit and register their asylum applications (see paragraphs 46-49, 57-59, 66-67 and 83-85 above) and, despite their written requests, were not issued and served with examination certificates as required by the domestic law (see paragraphs 49, 51, 59, 60, 68, 71 and 86 above).\n167: The Court notes that some of the decisions taken by the Russian administrative and judicial bodies were communicated to them with delays (see paragraphs 50, 69, 75 and 88 above).\n168: Also, the applicants were confined in a place which was clearly inappropriate for a long-term stay (see paragraphs 191-195 below).\n169: Lastly, the duration of each applicant’s stay in the airport transit zone was considerable and clearly excessive in view of the nature and purpose of the procedure concerned, ranging from five months to over a year and nine months (compare Kanagaratnam v. Belgium, no. 15297/09, §§ 94-95, 13 December 2011; see also Longa Yonkeu v. Latvia, no. 57229/09, § 131, 15 November 2011, where the combined length of three periods of detention lacking a legal basis amounted to three months and seven days; and Suso Musa, cited above, § 102, where the period in question was “more than six months”.)\n170: The Court finds that the applicants’ detention for the purposes of the first limb of subparagraph 5 § 1 (f) fell short of the Convention standards.\n171: There has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention in respect of each applicant.\n172: The applicants complained that the poor material conditions of their stay in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport had been incompatible with the guarantees of Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n173: The Chamber declared the complaint about the poor material conditions of the applicants’ detention in the airport transit zone admissible.\n174: Referring to the Court’s well-established standards regarding conditions of detention in general, as well as those relevant in the context of confinement of aliens, and noting the rules on distribution of the burden of proof in conditions of detention cases, the Chamber acknowledged that the applicants had provided a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention, constituting a prima facie case of ill-treatment. Given that the Government had not submitted any description of the conditions of the applicants’ confinement in the airport transit zone, the Chamber found it established that the applicants had not had individual beds and had not enjoyed access to shower and cooking facilities and considered it unacceptable that anyone could be detained in conditions in which there was a complete failure to take care of his or her essential needs. The Chamber concluded that the fact that the applicants had been detained for many months in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport in unacceptable conditions amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.\n175: Reiterating that their confinement in the transit zone had amounted to deprivation of liberty, the applicants emphasised that, according to the Court’s case-law, the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions compatible with respect for human dignity and that confinement of aliens must be accompanied by suitable standards, and maintained that they had stayed in the transit zone for lengthy periods of time in unacceptable conditions against their will, being unable to return to their home countries. They concluded that there had been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\n176: The Government stressed that a person under a State’s jurisdiction was not necessarily “at the hands of the authorities”. In the absence of a violation of Article 5 § 1, the Russian Government had not been under any obligation under Article 3 vis-à-vis the applicants, who had put themselves in difficult conditions through their own actions.\n177: The Government further stated that there was no right to asylum and no corresponding obligations were imposed on a State; however, a State could afford “appropriate protection” to persons fleeing from persecution. The applicants in the present case had acted in bad faith when applying for asylum as they should have known that they were not eligible for such protection and should have foreseen that they would not be allowed entry into Russia. The Government concluded that there had been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\n178: The UNHCR described the material conditions of the stay of asylumseekers in Russian airport transit zones as follows.\n179: The conditions of stay in airport transit zones were not regulated by Russian law. Nor had they been improved over the previous several years. Asylum-seekers stranded in transit zones were deprived of access to fresh air, privacy, food, and access to medical and social care. They had no choice but to stay in the open area of the transit zone in question without access to any hygienic facilities and to sleep on the floor. The UNHCR distributed basic food items and bed linen, clothing, and hygienic products on a weekly basis.\n180: Russian law did not place responsibility on any State authority for ensuring minimum basic care for asylum-seekers in transit zones. The period during which an asylum-seeker had to undergo such a dire lack of basic facilities could be prolonged as on average the complete asylum procedure, including appeals, could last between one and two years.\n181: Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of that level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, principally the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. In the context of confinement and living conditions of asylum seekers, the Court has summarised the relevant general principles in the case of Khlaifia and Others (cited above, §§ 158-69).\n182: Article 3 of the Convention requires the State to ensure that detention conditions are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject the detainees to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, their health and well-being are adequately secured (see, for example, Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 94, ECHR 2000XI).\n183: In so far as the confinement of aliens and asylum-seekers is concerned, the Court reiterates the standard under Article 3 of the Convention, as recapitulated in M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece ([GC], no. 30696/09, §§ 216-18, ECHR 2011 (see also Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, § 44, ECHR 2001II; Kaja v. Greece, no. 32927/03, §§ 45-46, 27 July 2006; S.D. v. Greece, no. 53541/07, §§ 45-48, 11 June 2009; Mahamed Jama v. Malta, no. 10290/13, §§ 86-89, 26 November 2015; Khlaifia and Others, cited above, §§ 163-67; Boudraa v. Turkey, no. 1009/16, §§ 28-29, 28 November 2017; and S.F. and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 8138/16, §§ 78-83, 7 December 2017), according to which it must be accompanied by suitable safeguards for the persons concerned and is acceptable only in order to enable States to prevent unlawful immigration while complying with their international obligations and without depriving asylum-seekers of the protection afforded by the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights (see also Rahimi v. Greece, no. 8687/08, § 62, 5 April 2011, Khlaifia and Others, cited above, § 162, in the context of positive obligations visàvis foreign nationals pending issuance of a transit visa; and Shioshvili and Others v. Russia, no. 19356/07, §§ 83-86, 20 December 2016).\n184: The States’ legitimate concern to foil the increasingly frequent attempts to circumvent immigration restrictions must not deprive asylumseekers of the protection afforded by these conventions (see Amuur, cited above, § 43).\n185: Where the Court is called upon to examine the conformity of the manner and method of the execution of the measure with the provisions of the Convention, it must look at the particular situations of the persons concerned (see Riad and Idiab, cited above, § 100). The States must have particular regard to Article 3 of the Convention, which enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic societies and prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment irrespective of the circumstances and of the victim’s conduct (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000IV).\n186: The Court further reiterates that, quite apart from the necessity of having sufficient personal space, other aspects of physical conditions of detention are relevant for the assessment of compliance with Article 3 in such cases. Relevant elements include access to outdoor exercise, natural light or air, availability of ventilation, and compliance with basic sanitary and hygiene requirements (see, for example, S.D. v. Greece, cited above, §§  49-54; Tabesh v. Greece, no. 8256/07, §§ 38-44, 26  November 2009; A.A. v. Greece, no. 12186/08, §§ 57-65, 22 July 2010; E.A. v. Greece, no. 74308/10, §§ 50-51, 30 July 2015; Abdi Mahamud v. Malta, no. 56796/13, §§ 89-90, 3 May 2016; Alimov v. Turkey, no. 14344/13, §§ 84-85, 6 September 2016; Abdullahi Elmi and Aweys Abubakar v. Malta, nos. 25794/13 and 28151/13, §§ 113-14, 22 November 2016; and Khlaifia and Others, cited above, § 167).\n187: The Court notes first of all that many of the Contracting Parties to the Convention are experiencing considerable difficulties in coping with the influx of migrants and asylum-seekers. The Court does not underestimate the burden and pressure this situation places on the States concerned and it is particularly aware of the difficulties involved in the reception of migrants and asylumseekers on their arrival at major international airports.\n188: However, the Court would reiterate in this connection that the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment is a fundamental value in democratic societies. It is also a value of civilisation closely bound up with respect for human dignity, part of the very essence of the Convention. The prohibition in question is absolute, for no derogation from it is permissible even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation or in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime, irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, § 158 with further references). The difficulties mentioned in the above paragraph cannot therefore absolve a State of its obligations under Article 3.\n189: Having regard to its earlier finding that the applicants’ stay in the airport transit zone amounted to a deprivation of liberty (see paragraph 156 above), the Court’s task in the present case is to review the applicants’ detention against the yardstick of the Convention provisions and to examine, in particular, whether the applicants were detained in conditions compatible with respect for human dignity (see Riad and Idiab, cited above, § 100, and Khlaifia and Others, cited above, § 162).\n190: It is important to note that the applicants gave a credible and reasonably detailed description of their living conditions in the airport transit zone, which are supported by similar findings by the UNHCR (see paragraphs 122, 179 and 180 above), and are not explicitly disputed by the Government. This being so, referring to its well-established standard of proof in conditions-of-detention cases (see Muršić v. Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, § 128, 20 October 2016; see also Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, §§ 121-23, 10 January 2012), the Court accepts that description as accurate.\n191: On the basis of the available material, the Court can clearly see that the conditions of the applicants’ stay in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport were unsuitable for an enforced long-term stay. In its view, a situation where a person not only has to sleep for months at a stretch on the floor in a constantly lit, crowded and noisy airport transit zone without unimpeded access to shower or cooking facilities and without outdoor exercise, but also has no access to medical or social assistance (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above) falls short of the minimum standards of respect for human dignity.\n192: This situation was aggravated in the circumstances of the case by the fact that the applicants were left to their own devices in the transit zone, in disregard of the Russian domestic rules granting every asylum-seeker the right to be issued with an examination certificate and to be placed in temporary accommodation facilities pending examination of the asylum application (see paragraphs 99 and 100 above; compare Riad and Idiab, cited above, § 101).\n193: The Court would also note that three of the applicants were eventually recognised by the UNHCR as being in need of international protection (see paragraphs 54, 77 and 94 above), which suggests that their distress was accentuated on account of the events that they had been through during their migration (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 232).\n194: Lastly, the Court notes the extremely long duration of the detention for each of the applicants. The applicants’ detention lasted for many months in a row: seven months and nineteen days in the case of Mr Z.A.; five months and one day in the case of Mr M.B.; one year, nine months and at least twenty-eight days in the case of Mr A. M.; and seven months and twenty-two days in the case of Mr Yasien (see paragraph 148 above).\n195: The Court considers that, taken together, the appalling material conditions which the applicants had to endure for such long periods of time and the complete failure of the authorities to take care of the applicants constitute degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.\n196: Nothing in the Government’s submissions warrants concluding otherwise. The Court has also ruled that the applicants were under the respondent State’s control and in their custody throughout the relevant period of time (see paragraph 151 above).\n197: The Court concludes that there has therefore been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of each applicant.\n198: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n199: Before the Chamber, the applicants claimed the following amounts in respect of non-pecuniary damage: 20,000 euros (EUR) each for Mr Z.A. and Mr Yasien, EUR 15,000 for Mr M.B. and EUR 35,000 for Mr A.M.\n200: The Chamber found that the applicants had experienced distress and frustration on account of the breaches of Article 5 § 1 and Article 3 of the Convention, and that those breaches could not be made good solely by its findings. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, it awarded Mr Z.A. and Mr Yasien EUR 20,000 each, EUR 15,000 to Mr M.B. and EUR 26,000 to Mr A.M. in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n201: In the Grand Chamber proceedings the applicants claimed identical amounts to those claimed before the Chamber.\n202: The Court considers that the applicants must have suffered distress and frustration as a result of the violations of Article 5 § 1 and Article 3 of the Convention in their case. It takes account of the circumstances of the present case, the claims made by each applicant and its practice adopted in previous comparable cases (see, for example, Riad and Idiab, cited above, § 117; Shamsa, cited above, § 65; and Rashed, cited above, § 81). Deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards them the same amounts in respect of non-pecuniary damage as the Chamber did, that is, EUR 20,000 each to Mr Z.A. and Mr Yasien, EUR 15,000 to Mr M.B., and EUR 26,000 to Mr A.M.\n203: Before the Chamber, the applicants submitted the following claims for costs and expenses incurred domestically: EUR 1,650 for Mr Z.A., EUR 1,250 for Mr M.B., EUR 3,500 for Mr A.M., and EUR 2,000 for Mr Yasien. As regards the costs and expenses incurred before the Court, the applicants claimed EUR 3,500 each.\n204: The Chamber awarded each applicant the sum of EUR 3,500, covering costs and expenses under all heads.\n205: In the Grand Chamber proceedings the applicants claimed, jointly, EUR 4,900 for costs and expenses incurred domestically, EUR 14,000 for the proceedings before the Chamber, and EUR 7,800 for the proceedings before the Grand Chamber, that is, EUR 26,700 in total. The applicants’ representatives requested that the sums awarded be paid directly into their respective bank accounts.\n206: According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and to its case-law, the Court considers excessive the total sum claimed for the costs and expenses incurred in the domestic proceedings and the proceedings before it. It decides to award the applicants EUR 19,000 jointly under that head. That sum is to be paid directly into the bank accounts of the applicants’ representatives (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, § 288).\n207: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

                "CASE OF ILIAS AND AHMED v. HUNGARY; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 47287/15) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Bangladeshi nationals, Mr Ilias Ilias and Mr Ali Ahmed (“the applicants”), on 25 September 2015.\n2: The applicants were represented by Ms B. Pohárnok, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z. Tallódi, Ministry of Justice.\n3: The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). On 14 March 2017 a Chamber of that Section composed of Ganna Yudkivska, President, Vincent A. De Gaetano, András Sajó, Nona Tsotsoria, Krzysztof Wojtyczek, Gabriele KucskoStadlmayer and Marko Bošnjak, judges and also of Marialena Tsirli, Section Registrar unanimously declared the application partly admissible and gave judgment. On 14 June 2017 the Government requested the referral of the case to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention. On 18 September 2017 the panel of the Grand Chamber granted that request.\n4: The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 26 §§ 4 and 5 of the Convention and Rule 24 of the Rules of Court. The President of the Grand Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the case should be assigned to the same Grand Chamber as the case of Z.A. and Others v. the Russian Federation (applications nos. 61411/15 and 3 others, 28 March 2017) (Rules 24, 42 § 2 and 71).\n5: The applicants and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 § 1) on the merits. In addition, third-party comments were received from the Governments of Bulgaria, Poland and the Russian Federation and, also, from the UNHCR, jointly from the Dutch Council for Refugees, the International Commission of Jurists and the European Commission on Refugees and Exiles and, separately, from five Italian scholars, all of whom had been given leave by the President of the Grand Chamber to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 3).\n6: A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 18 April 2018 (Rule 59 § 3).\n7: Both applicants are nationals of Bangladesh. According to information dating from December 2017, the first applicant, Mr Ilias Ilias, lives in Uedem, Germany, and the second applicant, Mr Ali Ahmed, in Barcelona, Spain.\n8: On 15 September 2015 the applicants arrived in Hungary from Serbia and entered the Röszke transit zone, situated on Hungarian territory at the border between the two countries. Their asylum requests submitted on the same day were rejected as being inadmissible within several hours and the applicants’ expulsion was ordered. Following the applicants’ appeal, they spent 23 days in the transit zone while the proceedings unfolded. On 8 October 2015, after the final decision rejecting their applications for asylum and ordering their expulsion, they were escorted out of the transit zone and crossed the border back into Serbia.\n9: The following summary of the applicants’ background is based on all their submissions to the Court. It appears that certain elements were not present in the allegations made to the Hungarian authorities or were only made in the second of the domestic sets of judicial proceedings or were presented with variations.\n10: The first applicant was born in Bangladesh in 1983. At the age of eight he found himself alone in Pakistan, without his family. He lived there until the age of twenty four or twenty five (with the exception of three months at the age of fourteen when he was allegedly expelled to Afghanistan, detained there and then returned to Pakistan). As a child, he worked illegally in a restaurant and later as a fisherman and a tailor. He claims that he suffered abuse in Pakistan, including by the police, and tried to flee to Iran but was repeatedly abused there and returned to Pakistan. In 2009 or 2010 the first applicant went to Bangladesh and stayed there for a year or slightly longer, living homeless and often abused by the police because he had no documents. During this period he distributed pamphlets for the BNP, a political party, and started to receive threats from supporters of another political party. In 2010 or 2011, he was expelled by the police to India, stayed there two weeks and then crossed into Pakistan. After four months in Pakistan he went to Iran, where he lived and worked for 18 months. From there he went to Turkey, worked there for another 18 months and then paid smugglers to bring him to Greece, where he spent two and a half months. In 2015 he crossed on foot into the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and then on to Serbia by train. He was in Serbia for an unspecified but apparently very short period before entering Hungary.\n11: The second applicant, born in 1980, lived in Bangladesh until 2010. He left because the floods of 2008 had destroyed his home and he had become destitute, surviving as a beggar. In 2010 he decided to go to India in search of better opportunities. His family who stayed in Bangladesh were killed in floods in 2010. The second applicant stayed in India for two months and then went to Pakistan, where he spent six months as captive of smugglers. The gang of smugglers eventually flew him to Dubai, made him work there for two years and then transferred him by boat to Iran. In Iran he worked for the same smugglers for two months before being taken by them to Turkey on foot. In Turkey, he was held captive by the smugglers for two weeks, then transferred to Greece. In Greece, the second applicant worked for two years. He there met the first applicant and they left together for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary.\n12: Both applicants’ mother tongue is the Sylheti dialect of Bengali, the official language of Bangladesh.\n13: Both applicants understand spoken Urdu and the first applicant speaks this language. It appears that the applicants declared before the Hungarian asylum authority that they also understood Turkish and English.\n14: The first applicant never went to school. The second applicant finished only the first three years of school and can read and write in Sylheti and Bengali at a basic level.\n15: The Röszke transit zone, as it was at the relevant time, was a compound with mobile containers and a narrow open-air area surrounded by approximately four-metre high fencing with barbed wire on the top. The entire zone was guarded by police officers and armed security guards. At the material time, applicants for asylum were held in the designated accommodation area consisting of approximately ten mobile containers (each measuring some 2.5 metres x 5.5 metres) furnished with three to five beds and an electric heater. There was a separate container for sanitary purposes and a bigger container used as a common room furnished with tables and chairs. The accommodation area was surrounded by a narrow open-air strip (approximately 2.5 metres wide and 40-50 metres long). Hot and cold running water and electricity were supplied. Three pork-free meals were available daily to the applicants in a dining-container.\n16: According to the applicants, they had no access to social or medical assistance while in the zone. There was no access to television or the Internet, landline telephone or any recreational facilities.\n17: According to the Government, medical care was available for two hours daily from doctors of the Hungarian Defence Force.\n18: According to the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture (“the CPT”), beds in the Röszke zone were fitted with clean mattresses, pillows and bedding. The accommodation containers had good access to natural light and artificial lighting. Further, there was a narrow designated area in front of the containers to which foreign nationals had unrestricted access during the day. The sanitary facilities were satisfactory and health care was provided (see paragraph 65 below).\n19: The applicants could not leave the zone for the remaining territory of Hungary. It appears that they could leave it for Serbia, but the parties are in dispute as to the legal and practical consequences of such a move.\n20: The applicants were interviewed by the Citizenship and Immigration Authority (“the asylum authority”) shortly after their arrival, with the assistance of an interpreter who spoke Urdu as a foreign language. The first applicant’s interview lasted two hours and the second applicant’s twenty-two minutes. During the interviews they explained the background to their departure from Bangladesh, and gave some details concerning their journey. The first applicant was provided with a two-page information leaflet in Urdu on asylum procedure.\n21: According to the notes taken by the Hungarian authorities during the interviews, Hungary was the first country where both applicants had applied for asylum. In Serbia, the first applicant had not met any official or representative of the authorities, nor had he even envisaged seeking protection in that country. The second applicant had once come across police officers while in Serbia but had not submitted an asylum request. He had insisted on continuing his journey, and the Serbian police had allegedly let him go after having issued him with a document ordering him to leave the country.\n22: During the interview, the first applicant was informed that he had three days to provide reasons for his decision not to request protection in Serbia and to explain why he had considered the possibility of seeking asylum in Serbia as non-existent or ineffective. The second applicant was also invited, albeit as an immediate obligation, to explain why he thought that he could not have obtained protection in Serbia. According to the notes of the interview, he answered that he had not asked for asylum there because he wanted to continue his journey.\n23: By two separate decisions delivered on the same day, 15 September 2015, the asylum authority (without, in the first applicant’s case, waiting for the three-day period given to him for rebutting the presumption about Serbia as a “safe third country”) rejected both applicants’ asylum applications, declaring them inadmissible on the grounds that Serbia was to be considered a “safe third country” according to Government Decree no. 191/2015(VII.21.) and the applicants had not rebutted that presumption as they had not even considered the possibility of submitting an asylum claim in Serbia. The asylum authority ordered the applicants’ expulsion from Hungary.\n24: The applicants challenged the decisions before the Szeged Administrative and Labour Court. The court listed a hearing in both the applicants’ cases for 21 September 2015.\n25: The applicants, through UNHCR representatives who had access to the transit zone, authorised two lawyers of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee to represent them in the judicial review proceedings. It appears that the authorities did not allow the applicants’ lawyers to enter the transit zone to consult with their clients until the evening of 21 September 2015, that is, after the court hearing.\n26: Nevertheless, on 21 September 2015, the day of the hearing, the applicants’ lawyers made written submissions, running to several pages, and also pleaded their case orally. The lawyers were present in the courtroom in Szeged, whereas the applicants communicated with the court via video link, with the help of an interpreter in Urdu.\n27: Both applicants stated that they had received a document from the Serbian authorities written in Serbian, which they could not understand, and that they had been ordered to leave Serbian territory. Both applicants showed the documents which they had received from the Serbian authorities; in the first applicant’s case, that document did not comprise his name, as it had been issued for another person. At the hearing, the second applicant submitted that he had applied for asylum in Serbia, but his application had not been examined.\n28: In their written and oral submissions, the applicants’ lawyers argued, in essence, that the asylum authority had violated the provisions of the Asylum Procedures Directive (Directive 2013/32/EU) by failing genuinely to examine the question whether Serbia could be considered a “safe third country” in the applicants’ particular situation. In their view, the decisions had been formalistic and lacked any individualised assessment. The applicants further complained that they had not been allowed to avail themselves of the statutory three-day time-limit to contest the application of the “safe third country” principle, as the asylum authority had adopted its decisions on the very day of the first interviews. They also argued that the decisions had not properly taken into account the relevant country information, in particular the reports of the UNHCR and a statement of the Serbian Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, dated 14 September 2015, according to which Serbia would not take back asylum-seekers from Hungary.\n29: On the same day the court annulled the asylum authority’s decisions and remitted the case to it for fresh consideration. It relied on section 3(2) of the Government Decree and argued that the asylum authority should have analysed the actual situation in Serbia regarding asylum procedure more thoroughly. It should also have informed the applicants of its conclusions on that point and afforded them three days to rebut the presumption of Serbia being a “safe third country” with the assistance of legal counsel.\n30: In the renewed procedure before the asylum authority, the applicants submitted a written opinion by a psychiatrist, who had visited them in the transit zone on 23 September 2015 and interviewed them with the assistance of an interpreter attending by telephone. The psychiatrist intervened at the request of the applicants’ lawyers and was commissioned by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee. In her opinion the psychiatrist stated that the first applicant had left Bangladesh in 2010 partly because of a flood and partly because two political parties had been trying to recruit him. He had been attacked and suffered injuries because of his refusal to do so. The psychiatrist observed that the first applicant was well-oriented, able to focus and recall memories, but showed signs of anxiety, fear and despair. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). With regard to the second applicant, the psychiatrist noted that he had fled his country five years earlier and had worked abroad, during which time his whole family had died in a flood. He had then migrated through several countries in order to restart his life. He was found to be well oriented with no memory loss but with signs of depression, anxiety and despair. He was diagnosed with PTSD and as having an episode of depression. The psychiatrist did not mention any need for medical or psychological treatment. However, she was of the opinion that the applicants’ mental state was liable to deteriorate due to the confinement.\n31: On 23 September 2015 the asylum authority informed the applicants’ legal representatives by telephone that a hearing would be held two days later. However, the representatives apparently considered that this was not a valid summons and did not attend.\n32: At the hearing before the asylum authority on 25 September 2015, the applicants decided not to make any statement since their legal representatives were not present. With the assistance of an Urdu interpreter, the asylum authority informed the applicants that they had three days to rebut the safe-third-country presumption.\n33: On 28 September 2015 the applicants’ legal representatives made submissions to the asylum authority protesting against the manner in which they were summoned and requested that a new hearing be held, which they would attend. They also stated that the applicants should be given a proper opportunity to comment on the material on the basis of which Serbia was deemed safe.\n34: On 30 September 2015 the asylum authority rejected the applications for asylum. It found that the reports prepared by the psychiatrist had not provided enough grounds to grant the applicants the status of “persons deserving special treatment” since they had not revealed any special need that could not be met in the transit zone. As to the status of Serbia being classified as a “safe third country”, the asylum authority had regard to relevant reports by the UNHCR and a non-governmental organisation. It further noted that the applicants had not referred to any pressing individual circumstances substantiating the assertion that Serbia was not a safe third country in their case, and therefore that they had been unable to rebut the presumption. The applicants’ expulsion from Hungary was consequently ordered.\n35: The applicants sought judicial review by the Szeged Administrative and Labour Court. They argued, in particular, that the asylum authority had based its decisions on selectively chosen and incorrectly interpreted country information. They also submitted that, in their view, the burden of proof was on the asylum authority first of all to show that Serbia was a safe third country for the applicants and to substantiate this finding with relevant country information and other evidence. The applicants argued that the three-day time-limit for their rebuttal of the application of the safe third country principle could not even lawfully begin to run because the asylum authority had failed to meet its obligation to prove its assertions convincingly. The applicants further contended that the asylum authority had failed to verify whether the Serbian authorities would readmit them, this also being a condition for the application of the “safe third country” principle. They also referred to various alleged procedural shortcomings.\n36: On 5 October 2015 the court, in separate decisions concerning the first and second applicant respectively, upheld the asylum authority’s decisions. It observed, in particular, that in the resumed procedure the asylum authority had examined, in accordance with the guidance of the court, whether Serbia could be regarded generally as a safe third country for refugees, and had found on the basis of the relevant law and the country information obtained that it was. It had considered the report of the Belgrade Centre for Human Rights published in 2015, the reports of August 2012 and June 2015 issued by the UNHCR concerning Serbia, and also other documents submitted by the applicants. It had established on the basis of those documents that Serbia satisfied the requirements of section 2 (i) of the Asylum Act. The court was satisfied that the asylum authority had established the facts properly and observed the procedural rules, and that the reasons for its decision were clearly stated and were reasonable. The court further emphasised that the statements given by the applicants at the hearings had been contradictory and incoherent. The first applicant had given various reasons for leaving his country and made confusing statements on whether he had received any documents from the Serbian authorities. The document he had finally produced was not in his name, and therefore could not be admitted as evidence. At no point during the administrative procedure had he referred to the conduct of the human traffickers before his hearing by the court. The second applicant’s statements were incoherent on the issue of the duration of his stay in Serbia and the submission of a request for asylum. The applicants had not relied on any specific fact that could have led the authority to consider Serbia unsafe in their regard. They had only contested the safety of Serbia in general, which was insufficient to rebut the presumption.\n37: The final decisions were served on the applicants on 8 October 2015. They were written in Hungarian but explained to them in Urdu. During the afternoon of the same day the applicants were escorted by police officers out of the transit zone and then entered Serbia.\n38: On 22 October 2015 the transcript of the court hearing held on 5 October 2015 was sent to the applicants’ lawyer. On 10 December 2015 the lawyer received the Bengali translation of the court’s decisions taken at the hearing. On 9 March 2016 the applicants’ petitions for review were dismissed on procedural grounds, since the Kúria held that it had no jurisdiction to review such cases.\n39: The applicants submitted descriptions of the removal in a note from the UNHCR and a letter from a Serbian non-governmental organisation whose representatives were present, as well as in a video interview with the applicants conducted on the evening of their return to Serbia with the assistance of a lawyer of another Serbian non-governmental organisation via an Urdu interpreter. The respondent Government did not contest the descriptions but maintained that the applicants had left Hungary voluntarily.\n40: It transpires from those descriptions that on the morning of 8 October 2015 UNHCR staff met the applicants at the transit zone and explained to them that following the judgment in their case they could return to Serbia voluntarily or appeal, in which case they would be detained for two months. The applicants expressed their wish to appeal and remain in Hungary and signed an appeal. The UNHCR staff left. In the early afternoon the police and the asylum authorities told the applicants, with the help of an Afghan man who could speak some Urdu, that the court had decided that they should go back to Serbia. The applicants replied that they did not want to go to Serbia and that the UN staff had told them that they might be able to stay for two months in Hungary. They handed a copy of the appeal they had signed but the authorities refused to take it. The police insisted and said that the applicants could choose between voluntary departure or detention and forceful handing over to the Serbian police. The applicants felt threatened and thought that they risked violence. They decided to leave. The police told them to cross into Serbia via the forest and not through the official checkpoint. As they were being led out of the transit zone the UNHCR staff arrived and conversed with the police who told them that the applicants had decided to leave Hungary voluntarily and also that they would not be escorted all the way and across to the Serbian side of the border. Serbian border police had informed the UNHCR staff and the Hungarian police officer that the applicants would not be allowed to enter Serbia through the official checkpoint without documents and that the only possibility would be to try to enter through the “green border”. The UNHCR representative made telephone calls to arrange for the applicants to be met at the other side of the border. The applicants were escorted only to the exit of the transit zone and given directions by the Hungarian police to go alone to the right, along the fence. No force was used. The UNHCR staff insisted and were eventually allowed to tell the two applicants that they would be met at the Serbian side of the border for which they had to go in another direction – to the left towards the highway and the Horgos border crossing on the Serbian side. This was communicated to the applicants. The applicants crossed the border as directed by the UNHCR and not through the forest. Serbian police officers were present when they crossed and only told them to wait for the UNHCR staff coming to meet them. The applicants were met by UNHCR staff who helped them.\n41: The relevant provisions of Act no. LXXX of 2007 on Asylum (“the Asylum Act”) provided as follows:\n42: The Government declared a state of crisis caused by mass immigration as of noon on 15 September 2015 in respect of the territory of Bács-Kiskun and Csongrád counties, where the Röszke transit zone was located. On 18 September 2015 the scope of the state of crisis was extended to the territory of Baranya, Somogy, Zala and Vas counties. On 9 March 2016 the state of crisis was maintained and extended to the whole territory of Hungary, until 7 September 2018.\n43: The relevant provisions of Act no. II of 2007 on the Admission and Right of Residence of Third Country Nationals (“the Immigration Act”) provide as follows:\n44: Government Decree no. 191/2015. (VII. 21.) on the definition of safe countries of origin and safe third countries provides:\n45: As of 28 March 2017 the Asylum Act was amended, in particular as regards the rules to be applied when a state of crisis caused by mass immigration is declared. According to the new rules, in such circumstances applications for recognition can only be submitted, with some limited exceptions, in the transit zone and asylum-seekers are required to wait there until the decision is taken after the examination of the merits of their applications (unlike in the situation regulated by section 71/A (5), they are not allowed to leave the transit zone even if the application is not found to be inadmissible). The time-limit for the court appeal against an inadmissibility decision adopted by the asylum authority is three days (as opposed to seven days under the ordinary rules). Unlike in the ordinary border procedure, section 66 (6) of the Asylum Act does not apply and the applicant cannot request the continuation of the procedure if it was discontinued upon his or her leaving the transit zone.\n46: In January 2018 the relevant laws were further amended in connection with the entry into force of the new Act on General Public Administration Procedures (Act no. CL of 2016) and the new Code of Administrative Justice (Act no. I of 2017). Another amendment was introduced in July 2018.\n47: The Preamble of this Directive, insofar as relevant, reads:\n48: Article 31, entitled “Examination procedure” reads, insofar as relevant:\n49: Article 33, entitled “Inadmissible applications” reads as follows:\n50: Article 34, entitled “Special rules on an admissibility interview”, reads, insofar as relevant:\n51: Article 35, entitled “The concept of first country of asylum”, reads as follows:\n52: Article 36, entitled: “The concept of safe country of origin”, reads as follows:\n53: Article 38, entitled “The concept of safe third country”, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:\n54: Article 39, entitled “The concept of European safe third country”, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:\n55: Article 43, entitled “Border procedures”, reads as follows:\n56: Article 46, entitled “The right to an effective remedy”, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:\n57: In its judgment of 21 December 2011 in the case of N. S. and M.E. (C-411/10 and C-493/10), the ECJ ruled inter alia on the concept of European safe third countries. It found that EU law precludes the application of a conclusive presumption that the Member State, which the Dublin II Regulation indicates as responsible, observes the fundamental rights of the European Union. In particular, the ECJ stated:\n58: Article 8, entitled “Detention”, reads as follows:\n59: This agreement, approved by Council Decision 2007/819/EC of 8 November 2007, provides, in so far as relevant:\n60: The relevant passages of this recommendation read as follows:\n61: In 1997 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe issued Guidelines on the Application of the Safe Third Country Concept to asylum-seekers. The Guidelines provide that, in order to assess whether a country is a safe third country to which an asylumseeker can be sent, all the criteria indicated below should be met in each case:\n62: In addition, the Guidelines indicate that:\n63: In 2009 the Committee of Ministers, in its Guidelines on human rights protection in the context of accelerated asylum procedures, required that all asylum seekers have an effective opportunity to rebut the presumption of safety of the third country, underlining that the application of this concept did not relieve a State of its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. It also stated that the criteria mentioned below must be satisfied when applying the safe-third-country concept:\n64: In its Resolution 1471 (2005) on Accelerated Asylum Procedure in Council of Europe Member States, the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly stated, inter alia:\n65: The Report to the Hungarian Government on the visit to Hungary carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“CPT”) from 21 to 27 October 2015 contains the following passages:\n66: The CPT revisited the Röszke transit zone in October 2017. In its report of that visit, the CPT noted that the zone had been enlarged but that asylum-seekers remained free to move only within the sector where their container was located. The premises were maintained in a good state of hygiene, and efforts were being made to allow for activities. However, almost all the containers were used at full capacity, which meant that five persons had to sleep in a 13 m² container.\n67: In the 13 October 2017 report (SG/Inf(2017)33) on his fact-finding mission of June 2017, Ambassador Tomáš Boček, Special Representative of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on migration and refugees, made, inter alia, the following observations concerning the Rӧszke transit zone. He noted that the area of the zone was surrounded by barbed wire fence and was guarded at all times. It was divided into sections, one of them designated for families and another for single men. The section for single men comprised one row of containers placed adjacent to each other, sharing an approximately 2-metre-wide corridor. Persons who stayed in one section could go to other parts of the zone only to visit the doctor or to attend interviews with the asylum authorities, and were always escorted by guards, even inside the transit zone. Also, at the time of the visit in June 2017 the Hungarian authorities had informed the Special Representative that the average duration of a stay in the zone had been 33 days, but he had spoken with individuals who had mentioned periods of confinement of two and more months. The Special Representative also described the living conditions in the zone and noted that hygiene was good, three meals a day, including one hot meal, were distributed, and there was a doctor’s room where basic medical care was provided.\n68: In a report entitled “Hungary as a country of asylum. Observations on restrictive legal measures and subsequent practice implemented between July 2015 and March 2016”, published in May 2016, the UNHCR made the following observations:\n69: A report entitled “Crossing Boundaries: The new asylum procedure at the border and restrictions to accessing protection in Hungary” by the European Council for Refugees and Exiles (“ECRE”) prepared on 1 October 2015 contains the following passages:\n70: The ECRE’s “Case Law Fact Sheet: Prevention of Dublin Transfers to Hungary” published in January 2016 contains the following passages:\n71: In any event, UNHCR maintains the position taken in its observations on the Serbian asylum system in August 2012 that asylum-seekers should not be returned to Serbia. While the number of asylum-seekers passing through that country has since greatly increased, leaving its asylum system with even less capacity to respond in accordance with international standards than before, many of UNHCR’s findings and conclusions of August 2012 remain valid. For example, between 1 January and 31 August 2015, the Misdemeanour Court in Kanjiža penalized 3,150 third country nationals readmitted to Serbia from Hungary for illegal stay or illegal border crossing, and sentenced most of them to a monetary fine. Such individuals are denied the right to (re) apply for asylum in Serbia.”\n72: Since 2001, Serbia is a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and to its 1967 Protocol.\n73: A report entitled “Serbia as a Country of Asylum: Observations on the Situation of Asylum-Seekers and Beneficiaries of International Protection in Serbia” prepared in August 2012 by the UNHCR contains the following passages:\n74: A report entitled “Country Report: Serbia”, up-to-date as of 31 December 2016, prepared by AIDA, Asylum Information Database, published by ECRE stated that the “adoption of the new [Serb] Asylum Act, initially foreseen for 2016, has been postponed”.\n75: The risk of deportation to countries of origin is relatively small for persons transferred to Serbia under readmission agreements. To UNHCR’s knowledge, even though Serbia has readmission agreements with the European Community and a number of bilateral agreements with EU and other States, foreign citizens are transferred to Serbia only from Hungary, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Upon reception by the border police in Serbia on their return, third-country nationals are routinely taken to the local courts and sentenced for irregular border crossing with either a short term prison term (10 to 15 days) or a fine (usually equivalent of 50 Euros). They are usually issued an order to leave the territory of Serbia within three days, but this is not enforced. As there is no removal procedure in place, they are generally left to depart on their own, and many resume their journey towards Western Europe.\n76: However, UNHCR received reports in November 2011 and again in February 2012 that migrants transferred from Hungary to Serbia were being put in buses and taken directly to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. ... There have been other reports that the Serbian police have rounded up irregular migrants in Serbia and were similarly sent back to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\n77: Pursuant to the Serbian Government’s “Decision Determining the List of Safe Countries of Origin and Safe Third Countries”, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, no. 67/2009, which was applicable in 2015, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece and Turkey, among others, are considered safe third countries.\n78: A report entitled “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia As a Country of Asylum” prepared in August 2015 by the UNHCR contains the following passages:\n79: ... Despite some incremental improvements notably with regard to reception standards, Serbia’s asylum system has been unable to cope with the recent increases in the numbers of asylum applicants. This has exposed significant shortcomings in numbers of personnel, expertise, infrastructure, implementation of the legislation and government support. .... The current system is manifestly not capable of processing the increasing numbers of asylum-seekers in a manner consistent with international and EU norms. These shortcomings, viewed in combination with the fact that there has not been a single recognition of refugee status since April 2008, strongly suggest that the asylum system as a whole is not adequately recognizing those in need of international protection.\n80: There is a need to set up a fair and efficient asylum procedure that is not only consistent with the existing legislative framework, but is also capable of adequately processing the claims of the increasing number of asylum-seekers in a manner consistent with international standards. ...\n81: Until such a system is fully established in Serbia, for the reasons stated above, UNHCR recommends that Serbia not be considered a safe third country of asylum, and that countries therefore refrain from sending asylum-seekers back to Serbia on this basis.”\n82: The decisive issue is whether the complaint in question was made out in submissions introduced in time. Before the Chamber the applicants had referred to several passages from their letter of 25 September 2015 and their application form of 13 October 2015, maintaining that they contained the complaint at issue. The Chamber considered that the complaint was formulated in the applicants’ letter of 25 September 2015, and therefore in time (see paragraphs 3 and 92-95 of the Chamber judgment).\n83: In particular, the applicants had referred to the following passage from the letter of 25 September 2015 (original in English):\n84: The Court notes that this passage appears in a sub-section relating solely to the question whether the stay in the transit zone amounted to deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention. The same letter of 25 September 2015, which runs to 15 pages, contains a separate sub-section about the physical conditions in the transit zone and the alleged violation of Article 3 in that respect but no mention of a complaint about lack of effective remedy can be found there. In these circumstances, it appears that the mention of “conditions under which the applicants ... are held in the transit zone” in the relevant passage cited above meant conditions affecting the question whether there was deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 and its lawfulness. A reference to Article 13 can only be found in the letter of 25 September 2015 in relation to the remedies against the expulsion order concerning the applicants.\n85: Under the Court’s case-law, some indication of the factual basis of the complaint and the nature of the alleged violation of the Convention is required to introduce a complaint and interrupt the running of the six-month period (see Fábián, cited above, § 94; Abuyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 27065/05, § 222, 2 December 2010; and Allan v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 48539/99, 28 August 2001). Under paragraph 7 of the Practice directions on institutions of proceedings, issued by the President of the Court in accordance with Rule 32 of the Rules of Court, as in force at the time the applicants submitted their application form dated 13 October 2015, applicants must set out the complaints and provide information that “should be enough to enable the Court to determine the nature and scope of the application”. Ambiguous phrases or isolated words do not suffice to accept that a particular complaint has been raised.\n86: In the present case the Grand Chamber considers that the above cited passage is too ambiguous to be interpreted as raising the complaint at issue.\n87: The Grand Chamber has also examined the remainder of the applicants’ submissions of 25 September and 13 October 2015 but is unable to find therein a complaint under Article 13 in conjunction with Article 3 regarding the alleged lack of remedies in respect of the living conditions in the Röszke transit zone. It is significant in this respect that these submissions were made by a lawyer and contained detailed reasoning, organised in separate sub-sections on each complaint made. It is highly unlikely that if the applicants had intended to raise the complaint in question they would have done so without devoting a separate point or sub-section to it. The Court finds, therefore, that this complaint was not introduced by the applicants in September or October 2015.\n88: The complaint was mentioned for the first time in the applicants’ observations in reply dated 29 August 2016, well after the expiry of the sixmonth time limit. It was formulated again later, in the applicants’ additional submissions of 28 November 2016.\n89: It follows that the Government’s preliminary objection must be upheld and that the complaint under Article 13 in conjunction with Article 3 regarding the alleged lack of remedies in respect of the living conditions in the Röszke transit zone, must be declared inadmissible under Article 35 § 4 of the Convention as having been submitted after the expiry of the sixmonth time limit under its Article 35 § 1.\n90: The respondent Government reiterated before the Grand Chamber their objection concerning the applicants’ victim status in relation to their complaint under Article 3 of the Convention about their removal to Serbia. Noting that the applicants had at no stage complained to the Serbian authorities or to the Court about refoulement from or ill-treatment in Serbia, the Government submitted that this fact was conclusive proof that the applicants had not been at risk at the time of the asylum procedure in Hungary, and therefore concluded that they could not have claimed, at any relevant time, to have been victims, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, of the alleged violation of Article 3.\n91: The applicants disagreed, as they had done before the Chamber. The Chamber dismissed the Government’s objection and declared the complaint under Article 3 admissible (see paragraphs 103-07 of the Chamber judgment).\n92: The Court considers that the issue raised in the Government’s objection – whether or not there was a real risk of ill-treatment in the event of removal to Serbia – potentially concerns the substance of the applicants’ complaint under Article 3 but not the victim-status requirement of Article 34 of the Convention.\n93: With regard to that requirement, it is sufficient to observe that the applicants were directly affected by the acts and actions complained of in that the expulsion decision was binding and enforceable and was followed by their removal from Hungary to Serbia. In those circumstances, the applicants could claim that they were the victims of the alleged violation of the Convention in relation to their removal (see the Court’s approach in, for example, Vijayanathan and Pusparajah v. France, 27 August 1992, §§ 4347, Series A no. 241-B).\n94: Noting, in addition, that the Government have not claimed that there were any other events, such as measures taken by the Hungarian authorities in the applicants’ favour and the acknowledgment of a violation removing their victim status (see Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 10511/10, § 83, 26 April 2016), the Court rejects the Government’s preliminary objection concerning the victim requirement of Article 34 of the Convention.\n95: The respondent Government argued that Hungary had acted in accordance with EU law, which limited the competence of the Court.\n96: The Court recalls that even when applying European Union law, the Contracting States remain bound by the obligations they freely entered into on acceding to the Convention. However, when two conditions are met – the absence of any margin of manoeuvre on the part of the domestic authorities and the deployment of the full potential of the supervisory mechanism provided for by European Union law – those obligations must be assessed in the light of the presumption of Convention conformity as established in the Court’s case-law (see Avotiņš v. Latvia [GC], no. 17502/07, § 105, 23 May 2016, with the references therein). The State remains fully responsible under the Convention for all acts falling outside its strict international legal obligations (see Bosphorus Hava Yolları Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim Şirketi v. Ireland [GC], no. 45036/98, § 157, ECHR 2005-VI).\n97: In the present case the relevant EU law (see paragraphs 47-58 above) consists of directives which do not impose on Hungary an obligation to act as they did, including holding the applicants in the transit area, forbidding them to enter Hungary, deciding not to assess the merits of their asylum request, relying on there being a safe third country, and declaring Serbia to be a safe third country. The Hungarian authorities exercised a discretion granted under EU law, and the impugned measures taken by them did not fall within Hungary’s strict international legal obligations. Accordingly, the presumption of equivalent protection by the legal system of the EU does not apply in this case and Hungary is fully responsible under the Convention for the impugned acts (see, for a similar outcome, M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, § 340, ECHR 2011).\n98: The applicants alleged that their expulsion to Serbia had exposed them to a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n99: The Chamber observed that between January 2013 and July 2015 Hungary had not considered Serbia as a safe third country, and no convincing explanation or reasons had been adduced by the Government for the reversal of that attitude, especially in the light of the reservations of the UNHCR and highly respected international human rights organisations. The Chamber further noted that the Hungarian authorities had not sought to rule out that if the applicants were removed to Serbia, they might further be expelled to Greece, where the reception conditions for asylum seekers were in breach of Convention standards. Also taking issue with other procedural shortcomings, the Chamber found that the applicants had not enjoyed any effective guarantees to protect them from a real risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in breach of Article 3.\n100: The applicants alleged that their removal to Serbia exposed them to a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3, because (a) there was a risk that they would not be admitted to Serbia or would not be allowed access to an asylum procedure, (b) there was a risk of chain-refoulement, and (c) there was no prospect of access to adequate reception facilities or to adequate protection taking account of their vulnerability.\n101: In particular, the Hungarian authorities knew that the applicants would not be allowed to enter and stay in Serbia, but nevertheless removed them in breach of the procedures under the applicable readmission agreement and without obtaining assurances from the Serbian authorities. On the day of the applicants’ removal the Hungarian authorities left them alone in Hungarian territory, just outside the transit zone, and obliged them to cross into Serbia illegally. There was furthermore a known practice on the part of the Serbian authorities, documented by the Ombudsperson of Serbia in October 2014 and by the UNHCR in 2016, not to allow returnees from Hungary to apply for asylum or have access to reception conditions. Other practices in Serbia noted by the UN bodies and NGOs included penalising readmitted third-country nationals for illegal border crossing despite their asylum-seeker status, and a risk of harassment and abuse. Moreover, the Serbian asylum procedure suffered from serious deficiencies.\n102: The applicants, referring to reports by UN bodies and NGOs, submitted that the risk of chain-refoulement and push-backs from Serbia to the Republic of North Macedonia and then to Greece was welldocumented. The Asylum Office of Serbia had confirmed in a letter of October 2016 that the concept of safe third countries was applied without seeking guarantees of access to their territory and asylum procedures. The Serbian list of safe third countries included the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece and Turkey, and asylum-seekers were routinely, indeed automatically, returned there.\n103: The applicants further stated that the Hungarian authorities must have known that persons in their situation would not be given access to reception facilities in Serbia, and that in any event those facilities and conditions were deficient.\n104: In those circumstances, the presumption [...] that asylum seekers will be treated in a way which complies with fundamental rights [...] must be regarded as rebuttable.”\n105: In particular, both the initial and the renewed asylum procedure in the applicants’ case were hastily carried out, and the time-limit for appeals was only seven days, which deprived the applicants of their right to rebut the presumption that Serbia was a safe third country in their case. Furthermore, each applicant was interviewed once in the first procedure, with no opportunity to receive prior information or legal assistance. They were unable to confer with a lawyer before the first hearing took place, and their lawyer was not properly notified of the time of the interview in the second, renewed procedure. The interpretation was not provided in the applicants’ mother tongue and was of a poor quality. The applicants at no stage received adequate procedural information in a language which they understood or information about the evidence that had been used as the basis for applying the safe third country rule to their case. Moreover, both the asylum authority and the Szeged court disregarded the country information and legal arguments submitted to them. In its decision of 5 October 2015, the Szeged court limited its review to the question whether the asylum authority had complied with the previous court ruling. Finally, the applicants were removed from the transit zone without proper notification of the relevant decisions, after their right to file a judicial review request against their potential deportation and expulsion decisions had been denied.\n106: In the applicants’ view, their asylum requests were rejected on the sole basis of the automatic application of the Government’s list of safe third countries. The authorities failed to consider widely available reports from reliable sources on the deficiencies of the Serbian asylum system and the realities on the ground and the applicants’ individual circumstances. Although there was a reference to three reports in the asylum authority’s second decision, the conclusions made were at odds with the reports’ findings. Moreover, instead of looking at the risks in the event of a future return to Serbia, the authorities merely noted that the applicants had not provided evidence of past illtreatment or denial of effective protection during their transit through Serbia. In view of the medical report on the applicants’ mental health the authorities should have examined the information on inadequate reception conditions, in particular for those returned to Serbia, who were known to be treated differently from new arrivals there.\n107: Finally, the applicants submitted that since the authorities’ assessment did not meet Convention standards, the respondent Government could not argue in the present case that there had been no Article 3 risks. They were also estopped from claiming that the applicants had had no arguable claim under Article 3 in relation to their country of origin: this was an unacceptable speculation since the inadmissibility procedure in the applicants’ case had excluded any assessment of the risks in relation to the country of origin.\n108: The Government emphasised the importance of the distinction between the right to seek asylum, recognised in international law, and a purported right to be admitted to a preferred country for the purpose of seeking asylum. To avoid feeding the false perception that there was a right to asylum in the country offering the best protection, it was necessary to adopt a careful and realistic interpretation of any alleged risk of refoulement and of the threshold of severity triggering the application of Article 3.\n109: In the Government’s view, the UNHCR tried to mitigate the consequences of humanitarian catastrophes by advocating a right to asylumshopping and pushing States towards ever higher standards of protection. This was approved by the NGOs and humanitarian organisations, as well as by those seeking cheap labour in Europe. However, in an era of globalisation the perception that everyone had a right to move to the EU to enjoy the benefits of a welfare State spread quickly, and it was becoming impossible to stop fake refugees from entering the EU while observing the standards advocated by the UNHCR. The practical impossibility of removing undocumented migrants who were not entitled to international protection had rendered immigration uncontrollable. This was causing social tension, a feeling of powerlessness and a sense of loss of sovereignty in affected States. Asylum-shopping diverted resources from the search for collective solutions by the international community to the resettlement of refugees or improving their situation in the first safe country. In this respect, asylum-shopping was contrary to Article 17 of the Convention.\n110: The Government considered that only a return to the rules of “wellestablished international law” could prevent escalation of the European migration crisis. A solution to the global issues of migration could only be found in the collective action of sovereign States if the ability to prevent abuses effectively was restored to them.\n111: The Government emphasised that the applicants did not face any danger in their country of origin, Bangladesh. Their accounts of their personal circumstances and their journeys to Western Europe had been contradictory and periodically readapted to suit their claims. Since the applicants had failed to establish a prima facie case of persecution in their country of origin, there was no risk of refoulement from Serbia.\n112: The Government stated that the Hungarian legislation adopted in 2015 was based on a possibility provided for under EU law. Hungary regarded Serbia, an EU candidate country, as a safe third country since it had agreed to be bound by all the relevant international treaties and EU requirements and benefited from EU support for reforms and upgraded asylum facilities. In any event, Hungarian law only established a presumption, rebuttable in individual cases. An applicant could only be sent back to a third country if the authorities were satisfied that the return would not lead to direct or indirect refoulement. The 2015 legislative amendment adding Serbia to the list of safe third countries was needed in the face of an unprecedented wave of migration aggravated by ever-increasing abuse of the right to asylum, including fake asylum-seekers and asylum-shopping by genuine asylum-seekers. It served to render the asylum procedures faster and more effective while maintaining the applicable guarantees.\n113: The low rate of successful asylum applications in Serbia is not the result of a deficient asylum system but of asylum-seekers leaving Serbia before the conclusion of the procedures. In 2015 (up to 31 July) 66,428 persons had requested asylum in Serbia at the borders and been directed to refugee reception centres, but only 486 of them had reported to those centres. The rest of them had left Serbia before the asylum procedure could be completed, or even started. A similar phenomenon had existed in Hungary until March 2017, when the authorities had begun to initiate the in-merit stage of the asylum procedure in the transit zones at the border: whereas the recognition rate in Hungary had previously been 0.5%, it had soared to 46% since then.\n114: Furthermore, there had been no UNHCR reports and no cases before the Court indicating that Serbia had violated the principle of nonrefoulement. The UNHCR report of August 2012, cited in the Chamber judgment, did not state that Serbia had failed to observe the principle of nonrefoulement. On the contrary: paragraph 75 of the report stated that the risk of deportation was relatively small and that asylum-seekers, even readmitted ones, were generally allowed to continue their journey towards Western Europe. The Chamber had ignored that finding. The Chamber had wrongly cited paragraph 76 of the same report, according to which in 20112012 irregular migrants returned to Serbia by the Hungarian authorities had on occasion been returned by the Serbian authorities to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: the report did not specify whether those irregular migrants were asylum-seekers or economic migrants or whether they had applied for asylum in Serbia at all. In addition, the UNHCR report had been drawn up in 2012, whereas in 2014 Serbian asylum law had been amended and the asylum system and facilities had been upgraded with the financial support of the EU. Furthermore, the Hungarian asylum authorities had given ample reasoning where they disagreed with some of the findings of the reports relied upon by the applicants, with special regard to the 2012 Report of the UNHCR.\n115: The applicants had had an opportunity to rebut the safe third country presumption applied in their case but had only made blanket general objections without invoking an individual risk. This was unsurprising having regard to their contradictory statements on the question whether the first applicant had received any documents from the Serbian authorities, as regards human traffickers mentioned by him for the first time at the last hearing and as regards the length of the second applicant’s stay in Serbia and whether or not he had requested asylum there. Contrary to their allegations, the burden of proof had not been reversed as they had not been required to prove the deficiencies of the asylum situation in Serbia in general. The relevant facts of general knowledge had been taken into account by the Hungarian authorities of their own motion without the applicants having to prove them. The applicants had merely been required to state how they had personally been affected by the alleged deficiencies.\n116: The fact that the applicants had not been handed over to the Serbian authorities under a readmission procedure but had simply re-entered Serbia had not prevented them from requesting asylum in Serbia had they so wished: they had been in the same legal position as those asylum-seekers who entered illegally from other States. Moreover, the applicants had made it clear that they had not intended at all to seek asylum in Serbia, which had rendered irrelevant the alleged deficiencies of the Serbian asylum system.\n117: Finally, as to the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 on account of the reception conditions in Serbia, there was nothing to suggest that the applicants would have been left without food, hygiene or shelter. The UNHCR had not observed any serious cases of neglect such as have been noted in Greece.\n118: The Bulgarian Government submitted that in expulsion and removal cases, in order to engage the indirect responsibility of the expelling State, the Court had first to analyse the existence of a real risk of illtreatment in the country of origin. If asylum-seekers were returned to a third “intermediate” country, the Court should analyse, in addition, whether the living and detention conditions for asylum-seekers there reached the threshold of severity under Article 3. Finding a violation without a rigorous examination of the above aspects opened the door to an influx of complaints and risked blocking the asylum system. The Bulgarian Government considered that in cases of expulsion to a State party to the Convention, the responsibility of the expelling State should be engaged only in highly exceptional circumstances, such as in M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, as far as Greece is concerned.\n119: The Polish Government considered, inter alia, that, as regards claims of a risk of ill-treatment in a country of destination, it was, in principle, for the foreigner to adduce the relevant evidence and to submit proof to the national authorities. The national authorities should not be held liable for a breach of their international obligations if they conducted a diligent assessment of the potential risks, with due regard to the principle of nonrefoulement. The Polish Government further submitted that EU Member States were entitled under the Asylum Procedures Directive to enact lists of safe third countries and stressed, in that regard, that the EU legal order secured respect for fundamental rights, including through supervision and control by the EU institutions.\n120: The Russian Government stressed that by failing to examine the grounds on which asylum is claimed, the Court was blurring the distinction between migrants and refugees, undermining the protection needed by the latter.\n121: The UNHCR provided a summary of the relevant international and EU law regarding the safe third country concept. They submitted, in particular, that that concept could apply where a person could have sought international protection in a “previous” State but had not done so. The removing State had to assess the appropriateness of the removal for each person individually and with full respect for the applicable procedural safeguards, regardless of any general designation of the third country as safe. Such assessment should include questions such as whether the third State would readmit the person, grant him or her access to a fair and efficient procedure for determination of any need of international protection, permit the person to remain and accord him or her treatment in conformity with international law, including the principle of protection from refoulement.\n122: In their joint intervention, the Dutch Council for Refugees, the European Council on Refugees and the International Commission of Jurists, offered an overview of the relevant EU and international law on the principle of non-refoulement, the concept of safe third country and deprivation of liberty in the asylum context.\n123: In so far as the Government submitted that the applicants had left the transit zone voluntarily, which can be understood as an objection to the effect that Hungary was not responsible for their expulsion, the Court observes that there was a binding decision ordering the applicants’ expulsion, and also considers that the manner in which the applicants returned to Serbia indicates that they did not do so of their own free will (see paragraph 40 above). The applicants’ removal from Hungary is therefore imputable to the respondent State.\n124: The prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment, enshrined in Article 3 of the Convention, is one of the most fundamental values of democratic societies. It is also a value of civilisation closely bound up with respect for human dignity, part of the very essence of the Convention (see Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 16483/12, § 158, 15 December 2016).\n125: Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations, including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens (see, among many other authorities, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 67, Series A no. 94, and Mohammadi v. Austria, no. 71932/12, § 58, 3 July 2014). A right to political asylum is not contained in either the Convention or its Protocols (see Sharifi v. Austria, no. 60104/08, § 28, 5 December 2013).\n126: Deportation, extradition or any other measure to remove an alien may give rise to an issue under Article 3, however, and hence engage the responsibility of the Contracting State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if removed, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In such circumstances, Article 3 implies an obligation not to remove the individual to that country (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, §§ 90-91, Series A no. 161; Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, 30 October 1991, § 103, Series A no. 215; H.L.R. v. France, 29 April 1997, § 34, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III; Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, § 135, 11 January 2007; and Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 27765/09, § 114, ECHR 2012).\n127: The assessment of whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3 must necessarily be a rigorous one (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 96, Reports 1996V) and inevitably involves an examination by the competent national authorities and later by the Court of the conditions in the receiving country against the standards of Article 3 (see Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he or she will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (see Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, § 60, ECHR 2001-II).\n128: In the context of complaints about expulsion of asylum seekers, the Court has dealt with cases concerning a variety of situations, including expulsions to and alleged risks in the applicant’s country of origin (see, for example, F.G. v. Sweden [GC], no. 43611/11, 23 March 2016) and removals to third countries and risks related to such third countries (see, for example, M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, and Tarakhel v. Switzerland [GC], no. 29217/12, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). While the basic principles mentioned in the three preceding paragraphs apply in all circumstances, the underlying issues and, consequently, the content of the expelling State’s duties under the Convention, may differ.\n129: In cases where the authorities choose to remove asylum seekers to a third country, the Court has stated that this leaves the responsibility of the Contracting State intact with regard to its duty not to deport them if substantial grounds have been shown for believing that such action would expose them, directly (i.e., in that third country) or indirectly (for example, in the country of origin or another country), to treatment contrary to, in particular, Article 3 (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, §§ 342, 343 and 362-68, with the references therein).\n130: However, where a Contracting State seeks to remove the asylum seeker to a third country without examining the asylum request on the merits, the State’s duty not to expose the individual to a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 is discharged in a manner different from that in cases of return to the country of origin.\n131: While in the latter situation the expelling authorities examine whether the asylum claim is well founded and, accordingly, deal with the alleged risks in the country of origin, in the former situation the main issue before them is whether or not the individual will have access to an adequate asylum procedure in the receiving third country. That is so because the removing country acts on the basis that it would be for the receiving third country to examine the asylum request on the merits, if such a request is made to the relevant authorities of that country. In addition to this main question, where the alleged risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 concerns, for example, conditions of detention or living conditions for asylum seekers in a receiving third country, that risk is also to be assessed by the expelling State.\n132: In respect of Contracting Parties to which the EU Asylum procedures directive applies, its Articles 33, 38 and 43, in the light of recitals 3848 (see paragraphs 47, 49, 53 and 55 above), provide for a possibility to enact national legislation that allows, under certain conditions, to forego an examination of requests for international protection on the merits (i.e., to refrain from examining whether the person qualifies for international protection, and therefore to refrain from dealing with risks in the country of origin) and to undertake instead an examination of admissibility, in the sense of the above-mentioned EU directive (in particular, whether it can reasonably be assumed that another country would conduct the examination on the merits or provide protection). Where the latter option has been chosen and the asylum request has been found to be inadmissible, no examination on the merits takes place in the country which has so decided.\n133: As the Court stated in Mohammadi (cited above, § 60), a case concerning removal between two EU Member States and the application of the EU Dublin II Regulation, the expelling State has to make sure that the intermediary country’s asylum procedure affords sufficient guarantees to avoid an asylum-seeker being removed, directly or indirectly, to his country of origin without a proper evaluation of the risks he faces from the standpoint of Article 3 of the Convention (see also M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 358; Sharifi, cited above, § 30; T.I. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 43844/98, ECHR 2000-III; and K.R.S. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 32733/08, 2 December 2008).\n134: The Court would add that in all cases of removal of an asylum seeker from a Contracting State to a third intermediary country without examination of the asylum requests on the merits, regardless of whether the receiving third country is an EU Member State or not or whether it is a State Party to the Convention or not, it is the duty of the removing State to examine thoroughly the question whether or not there is a real risk of the asylum seeker being denied access, in the receiving third country, to an adequate asylum procedure, protecting him or her against refoulement. If it is established that the existing guarantees in this regard are insufficient, Article 3 implies a duty that the asylum seekers should not be removed to the third country concerned.\n135: The respondent Government, supported by the intervening Bulgarian and Russian Governments, was apparently of the view that the above-mentioned obligation did not arise where – allegedly as here – the individuals concerned were not genuine asylum-seekers but migrants who did not risk ill-treatment in their country of origin (see paragraphs 108-111, 118 and 120 above).\n136: The Court observes that, with regard to asylum seekers whose claims are unfounded or, even more so, who have no arguable claim about any relevant risk necessitating protection, Contracting States are free, subject to their international obligations, to dismiss their claims on the merits and return them to their country of origin or a third country which accepts them. The form of such examination on the merits will naturally depend on the seriousness of the claims made and the evidence presented.\n137: Where a Contracting State removes asylum seekers to a third country without examining the merits of their asylum applications, however, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that in such a situation it cannot be known whether the persons to be expelled risk treatment contrary to Article 3 in their country of origin or are simply economic migrants. It is only by means of a legal procedure resulting in a legal decision that a finding on this issue can be made and relied upon. In the absence of such a finding, removal to a third country must be preceded by thorough examination of the question whether the receiving third country’s asylum procedure affords sufficient guarantees to avoid an asylum-seeker being removed, directly or indirectly, to his country of origin without a proper evaluation of the risks he faces from the standpoint of Article 3 of the Convention. Contrary to the position of the respondent Government, a postfactum finding that the asylum seeker did not run a risk in his or her country of origin, if made in national or international proceedings, cannot serve to absolve the State retrospectively of the procedural duty described above. If it were otherwise, asylum-seekers facing deadly danger in their country of origin could be lawfully and summarily removed to “unsafe” third countries. Such an approach would in practice render meaningless the prohibition of ill-treatment in cases of expulsion of asylum seekers.\n138: While the Court acknowledges the respondent Government’s contention that there are cases of abuse by persons who are not in need of protection in their country of origin, it considers that States can deal with this problem without dismantling the guarantees against ill-treatment enshrined in Article 3. It suffices in that regard, if they opt for removal to a third safe country without examination of the asylum claims on the merits, to examine thoroughly whether that country’s asylum system could deal adequately with those claims. In the alternative, as stated above, the authorities can also opt for dismissing unfounded asylum requests after examination on the merits, where no relevant risks in the country of origin are established.\n139: On the basis of the well-established principles underlying its caselaw under Article 3 of the Convention in relation to expulsion of asylumseekers, the Court considers that the above-mentioned duty requires from the national authorities applying the “safe third country” concept to conduct a thorough examination of the relevant conditions in the third country concerned and, in particular, the accessibility and reliability of its asylum system (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, §§ 344-59 and §§ 365-68). The Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and its Guidelines cited in paragraphs 61-63 above, as well as Resolution 1471 (2005) of the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly (see paragraph 64 above), can be relevant in that regard.\n140: Furthermore, a number of the principles developed in the Court’s case-law regarding the assessment of risks in the asylum seeker’s country of origin also apply, mutatis mutandis, to the national authorities’ examination of the question whether a third country from which the asylum seeker came is “safe” (see the approach followed in M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, §§ 346-52 and 358-59).\n141: In particular, while it is for the persons seeking asylum to rely on and to substantiate their individual circumstances that the national authorities cannot be aware of, those authorities must carry out of their own motion an up-to-date assessment, notably, of the accessibility and functioning of the receiving country’s asylum system and the safeguards it affords in practice. The assessment must be conducted primarily with reference to the facts which were known to the national authorities at the time of expulsion but it is the duty of those authorities to seek all relevant generally available information to that effect (Sharifi, cited above, §§ 31 and 32). General deficiencies well documented in authoritative reports, notably of the UNHCR, Council of Europe and EU bodies are in principle considered to have been known (see, M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, §§ 34650, see also, mutatis mutandis, F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, §§ 12527). The expelling State cannot merely assume that the asylum seeker will be treated in the receiving third country in conformity with the Convention standards but, on the contrary, must first verify how the authorities of that country apply their legislation on asylum in practice (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 359).\n142: As noted above, the content of the expelling State’s duties under Article 3 differs depending on whether the receiving country is the asylum seeker’s country of origin or a third country and, in the latter situation, on whether the expelling State has dealt with the merits of the asylum application or not. As a consequence, the Court’s task is in principle different in all of the above-mentioned categories of cases, subject to the complaints raised by the applicant involved.\n143: In the present case, based on section 51 of the Hungarian Asylum Act (see paragraph 41 above), which provided for the inadmissibility of asylum requests in a number of circumstances and reflected the choices made by Hungary in transposing the relevant EU law, the Hungarian authorities did not examine the applicants’ asylum requests on the merits, that is to say, whether the applicants risked ill-treatment in their country of origin, Bangladesh, but declared them inadmissible on the basis that they had come from Serbia, which, according to the Hungarian authorities was a safe third country and, therefore, could take in charge the examination of the applicants’ asylum claims on the merits (see paragraphs 23, 34 and 36 above).\n144: As a consequence, the thrust of the applicants’ complaints under Article 3 (see paragraph 100 above) is that they were removed despite clear indications that they would not have access in Serbia to an adequate asylum procedure capable of protecting them against refoulement. The Court’s task in the present case is, above all, to deal with this main complaint (see, for a similar approach, Babajanov v. Turkey, no. 49867/08, § 43 in fine, 10 May 2016, and Sharifi, cited above, § 33).\n145: Since the Hungarian authorities’ impugned decision to remove the applicants to Serbia was unrelated to the situation in Bangladesh and the merits of the applicants’ asylum claims, it is not the Court’s task to examine whether the applicants risked ill-treatment in Bangladesh. Such analysis would be unrelated to the question whether the respondent State discharged its procedural obligations under Article 3 in the present case.\n146: In this regard, the Court is not oblivious of the fact that in some cases of removal of asylum seekers to third intermediary countries without examination of the merits of the asylum claim by the removing State, it has included text mentioning that the applicants’ claim about risks in their countries of origin were arguable, which could be seen as the Court taking a stand, in the context of Article 3 of the Convention, on whether or not the risks invoked in respect of the country of origin were arguable (see, among several others, T.I. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), cited above and M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 344; but see also the opposite approach in Mohammadi, cited above, §§ 64-75, Sharifi, cited above, §§ 2639; Tarakhel, cited above, §§ 93-122; and Mohammed Hussein and Others v. the Netherlands and Italy (dec.), no. 27725/10, §§ 62-79, 2 April 2013).\n147: In the present case the Grand Chamber, having had the benefit of the parties’ submissions devoted specifically to this question, considers that it is not for the Court to act as a court of first instance and deal with aspects of the asylum claims’ merits in a situation where the defendant State has opted – legitimately so – for not dealing with those and at the same time the impugned expulsion is based on the application of the “safe third country” concept. The question whether there was an arguable claim about Article 3 risks in the country of origin is relevant in cases where the expelling State dealt with these risks.\n148: It follows that, having regard to the facts of the case and the applicants’ complaints regarding the allegedly deficient approach of the Hungarian authorities, the Court must examine: 1) whether these authorities took into account the available general information about Serbia and its asylum system in an adequate manner and of their own initiative and, 2) whether the applicants were given sufficient opportunity to demonstrate that Serbia was not a safe third country in their particular case.\n149: Finally, the Court may also have to address the applicants’ complaint that the Hungarian authorities failed to take into consideration the allegedly inadequate reception conditions for asylum seekers in Serbia (see, for example, Tarakhel, cited above, § 105).\n150: The Court’s approach in examining these questions must be guided by the principle, stemming from Article 1 of the Convention, according to which the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the guaranteed rights and freedoms is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. It is not the Court’s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts. The Court must be satisfied, however, that the assessment made by the authorities of the Contracting State is adequate and sufficiently supported by domestic materials as well as by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources (see, mutatis mutandis, F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, §§ 117 and 118).\n151: The Court observes that in the applicants’ case the Hungarian authorities relied on a list of “safe third countries” established by Government decree no. 191/2015. (VII.21.) (see paragraph 44 above). The effect of this list was to put in place a presumption that the listed countries were safe.\n152: The Convention does not prevent Contracting States from establishing lists of countries which are presumed safe for asylum seekers. Member States of the EU do so, in particular, under the conditions laid down by Articles 38 and 39 of the Asylum Procedures Directive (see paragraphs 53 et seq. above). The Court considers, however, that any presumption that a particular country is “safe”, if it has been relied upon in decisions concerning an individual asylum seeker, must be sufficiently supported at the outset by an analysis of the relevant conditions in that country and, in particular, of its asylum system.\n153: The presumption at issue in the present case was put in place in July 2015, when Hungary changed its previous position and declared Serbia to be a safe third country. The Government’s submissions before the Grand Chamber appear to confirm that the grounds for this change consisted exclusively of the following: Serbia was bound by the relevant international conventions; as a candidate to become EU Member State it benefitted from assistance in improving its asylum system; and there was an unprecedented wave of migration and measures had to be taken (see paragraph 112 above).\n154: The Court notes, however, that in their submissions to the Court the respondent Government have not mentioned any facts demonstrating that the decisionmaking process leading to the adoption of the presumption in 2015 involved a thorough assessment of the risk of lack of effective access to asylum proceedings in Serbia, including the risk of refoulement.\n155: The Court is mindful of the challenge faced by the Hungarian authorities during the relevant period in 2015, when a very large number of foreigners were seeking international protection or passage to western Europe at Hungary’s borders. However, the absolute nature of the prohibition of illtreatment enshrined in Article 3 of the Convention mandates an adequate examination of the risks in the third country concerned.\n156: Turning to the individual assessment made by the asylum authority and the national court in the applicants’ cases, the Court observes that their decisions referred to the above mentioned presumption but also to widely available information about certain alleged risks in Serbia. They further dealt with the question whether there were any specific individual risks for the applicants (see paragraphs 34 and 36 above).\n157: The Court also observes that the applicants, who were legally represented, had an opportunity to make submissions in the proceedings against both the first and the second decisions of the asylum authority. The applicants’ lawyers made detailed written and oral submissions to the national court. Throughout the asylum proceedings, the applicants could communicate with the authorities and the court via an interpreter in Urdu, a language they understood (see paragraphs 26-28 and 30-35 above). In those circumstances the Court is not prepared to attach significant weight to the applicants’ arguments regarding time-limits and alleged shortcomings of a technical nature.\n158: The Court is not convinced, however, by the respondent Government’s argument that the administrative authorities and the national court thoroughly examined the available general information concerning the risk of the applicants’ automatic removal from Serbia without effective access to an asylum procedure. In particular, it does not appear that the authorities took sufficient account of consistent general information that at the relevant time asylum-seekers returned to Serbia ran a real risk of summary removal to the Republic of North Macedonia and then to Greece and, therefore, of being subjected to conditions incompatible with Article 3 in Greece.\n159: While it is true that, as argued by the respondent Government, statistics about the rate of successful asylum applications in Serbia or similar data are distorted by the fact that many asylum-seekers do not remain in Serbia and seek to reach Western Europe, there was other reliable information which did not seem to have been taken into consideration by the Hungarian authorities. In particular, a significant risk of refoulement from Serbia transpired from the findings of the UNHCR in their report of August 2012 (confirmed in the report of May 2016) (see paragraph 73 above) and other available sources (see paragraphs 69 and 77 above): lack of administrative capacity and resources in Serbia at the relevant time to assess asylum claims in accordance with international standards and to protect against refoulement; accounts of cases where aliens reentering Serbia from Hungary were put on buses directly to the border with North Macedonia; accounts of cases of denials of the right to apply for asylum in Serbia to individuals readmitted from Hungary; information about an automatic application of Serbia’s list of safe third countries to those who have transited, inter alia, through North Macedonia and Greece. The information concerning the above serious risks was confirmed in later sources (see paragraphs 68 and 75 above).\n160: In the Court’s view the asylum authority and the national court made only passing references to the UNHCR report and other relevant information, without addressing in substance or in sufficient detail the concrete risks pinpointed there and, in particular, the risk of arbitrary removal in the two applicants’ specific situation (see paragraphs 34 and 36 above). Although the applicants were able to make detailed submissions in the domestic proceedings and were legally represented, the Court is not convinced that this meant that the national authorities had given sufficient attention to the risks of denial of access to an effective asylum procedure in Serbia.\n161: It is significant, furthermore, that the risk of summary removal from Serbia to other countries could have been alleviated in this particular case if the Hungarian authorities had organised the applicants’ return to Serbia in an orderly manner or through negotiations with the Serbian authorities. However, the applicants were not returned on the strength of an arrangement with the Serbian authorities but were made to cross the border into Serbia without any effort to obtain guarantees (see paragraph 40 above and criterion “d” of the 2009 Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in paragraph 63 above). This exacerbated the risk of denial of access to an asylum procedure in Serbia and, therefore, of summary removal from that country to North Macedonia and then to Greece (see, for example, Tarakhel, cited above, §§ 12022, where in the individual circumstances of the case the Court considered decisive, regarding the potential violation of Article 3, for the Swiss authorities to obtain guarantees from the Italian authorities).\n162: Finally, as regards the Government’s argument that all parties to the Convention, including Serbia, North Macedonia and Greece, have the same obligations and that Hungary should not bear an additional burden to compensate for their deficient asylum systems, the Court considers that this is not a sufficient argument to justify a failure by Hungary, which opted for not examining the merits of the applicants’ asylum claims, to discharge its own procedural obligation, stemming from the absolute nature of the prohibition of ill-treatment under Article 3 of the Convention (see the Court’s approach in M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above; see also Tarakhel, cited above, §§ 104 and 105, and Paposhvili v. Belgium [GC], no. 41738/10, § 193, 13 December 2016).\n163: In sum, having regard, in particular, to the fact that there was an insufficient basis for the Government’s decision to establish a general presumption concerning Serbia as a safe third country, that in the applicants’ case the expulsion decisions disregarded the authoritative findings of the UNHCR as to a real risk of denial of access to an effective asylum procedure in Serbia and summary removal from Serbia to North Macedonia and then to Greece, and that the Hungarian authorities exacerbated the risks facing the applicants by inducing them to enter Serbia illegally instead of negotiating an orderly return, the Court finds that the respondent State failed to discharge its procedural obligation under Article 3 of the Convention to assess the risks of treatment contrary to that provision before removing the applicants from Hungary.\n164: These considerations are sufficient for the Court to find that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\n165: In the light of this finding the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine whether Article 3 was violated on the additional ground (see paragraph 149 above) that the Hungarian authorities allegedly failed to take into consideration the risk of the applicants being subjected to inadequate reception conditions for asylum seekers in Serbia.\n166: The applicants complained that the domestic remedies concerning their expulsion were ineffective and that therefore there was a violation of Article 13 of the Convention in conjunction with its Article 3. Article 13 reads as follows:\n167: In respect of this complaint, the Chamber decided that it was not necessary to examine its admissibility or merits (see paragraphs 126 and 127 of the Chamber judgment).\n168: As a consequence, the parties apparently disagree as to whether the complaint at issue falls within the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber, having regard to the fact that it has not been declared admissible by the Chamber. The applicants consider that there is no obstacle to the Grand Chamber examining this complaint. In their observations, the Government only dealt with the complaints declared admissible by the Chamber. In their oral submissions, they noted that the complaint at issue had never been communicated to them.\n169: The situation in the present case is peculiar in that the Chamber did not rule on the admissibility of the complaint at issue. The question arises, therefore, whether a complaint which has neither been rejected as inadmissible, nor declared admissible by the Chamber falls within the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber in proceedings under Article 43 of the Convention.\n170: Under the Convention system as it existed prior to the entry into force of Protocol No. 11, when a separate body, the former Commission, examined the admissibility of applications, the Court’s approach to the scope of the case before it was expressed in the following terms (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, § 106, Series A no. 39):\n171: Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, the question of the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber in proceedings under Article 43 was dealt with for the first time in K. and T. v. Finland [GC] (no. 25702/94, §§ 137-41, ECHR 2001-VII) in the context of the parties’ position that the Grand Chamber should only deal with complaints in respect of which referral had been requested. The Grand Chamber found that “the ‘case’ referred to it under Article 43 of the Convention embraces all aspects of the application previously examined by the Chamber in its judgment, and not only the serious ‘question’ or ‘issue’ at the basis of the referral” (ibid., § 140). The Court also added “for the sake of clarification” that the case referred to the Grand Chamber “is the application as it has been declared admissible” (ibid., § 141).\n172: This wording has been used in a number of later cases as well (see Üner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, § 41, ECHR 2006-XII; D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00 § 109, ECHR 2007IV; and Kovačić and Others v. Slovenia [GC], nos. 44574/98 and 2 others, § 194, 3 October 2008). The Court has also stated that the scope of the case referred to the Grand Chamber is “delimited by the Chamber’s decision on admissibility” (see Göç v. Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, §§ 35-37, ECHR 2002-V; Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, §§ 23-24, ECHR 2003-V; and Azinas v. Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, § 32, ECHR 2004-III).\n173: In a significant number of referral cases, the Grand Chamber has had to deal with requests from applicants to re-examine complaints declared inadmissible by the Chamber. In judgments concerning such cases the Court has often added more specific wording, stating that the Grand Chamber “cannot examine those parts of the case which have been declared inadmissible” (see Kurić and Others v. Slovenia [GC], no. 26828/06, § 234, ECHR 2012 (extracts), and Murray, cited above, § 86). In some judgments (see Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia (striking out) [GC], no. 60654/00, § 61, ECHR 2007-I; Kurić and Others, cited above, § 235; and Herrmann v. Germany [GC], no. 9300/07, § 38, 26 June 2012), the Court has also stated that “the Grand Chamber may examine the case in its entirety in so far as it has been declared admissible” or that it “may examine the case only in so far as it has been declared admissible” (see Gillberg v. Sweden [GC], no. 41723/06, §§ 53-55, 3 April 2012; AlDulimi and Montana Management Inc. v. Switzerland [GC], no. 5809/08, § 78, 21 June 2016; and Zubac v. Croatia [GC], no. 40160/12, § 56, 5 April 2018). It should be noted, however, that this wording has been used in the context of complaints declared inadmissible by the Chamber (almost all such cases) or in relation to a request for the re-examination of the panel’s referral decision (see Pisano v. Italy (striking out) [GC], no. 36732/97, § 27, 24 October 2002). It appears not to have been used in respect of complaints the admissibility of which had not been examined by the Chamber.\n174: The above case-law analysis appears to demonstrate that the fact that the Court has repeatedly mentioned the Chamber’s admissibility decision as the act delimiting the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber in referral proceedings is related partly to the Convention system as it existed prior to the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 and partly to the fact that in the vast majority of the relevant judgments the Grand Chamber had to deal with requests to re-examine complaints declared inadmissible. It cannot be said that this wording was intended to mean that the Grand Chamber cannot examine complaints that were neither rejected as inadmissible nor declared admissible by the Chamber.\n175: The Court also notes that the exclusion of complaints declared inadmissible from the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber may be seen as flowing from the settled case-law according to which a decision to declare a complaint inadmissible is final (see, for example, Budrevich v. the Czech Republic, no. 65303/10, § 73, 17 October 2013). By contrast, where complaints which have not been declared inadmissible are concerned, there is no final decision closing their examination.\n176: The Court recalls, in addition, that it is the master of the legal characterisation of the facts in the case (see Guerra and Others v. Italy, 19 February 1998, § 44, Reports 1998I, and Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, § 114, 20 March 2018) and that, furthermore, it may decide not to examine a particular complaint separately, considering that it is subsumed or otherwise closely linked to a complaint that has already been dealt with. Indeed, this was the basis for the Chamber’s decision in the present case not to examine the admissibility and merits of the complaint under Article 13 in conjunction with Article 3 concerning the domestic remedies against the applicants’ removal to Serbia.\n177: In the Court’s view, therefore, any excessively rigid approach to delimiting the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber may adversely affect its role as the master of the legal characterisation of the facts of the case with regard to complaints that have not been declared inadmissible. Furthermore, considering that a complaint that has not been declared inadmissible by the Chamber does not fall within the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber would amount to a de facto rejection of such a complaint as inadmissible. However, such an outcome cannot be accepted as it would prevent the Grand Chamber, without any reasons given by the Chamber, from assessing the question of admissibility of the complaint at issue in a situation where the Chamber has refrained from doing so.\n178: The Court finds, therefore, that the complaint under Article 13 in conjunction with Article 3 regarding the alleged procedural shortcomings in the examination of the applicants’ asylum request and the appeals against the asylum authority’s decisions falls within the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber.\n179: However, in the present case, having found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraphs 163 and 164 above), the Grand Chamber agrees with the Chamber that, in view of the fact that the alleged procedural shortcomings in the examination of the applicants’ asylum request and the appeals against the asylum authority’s decisions have been sufficiently examined under that Article, it is not necessary to examine the admissibility and merits of the complaint under Article 13 regarding those same alleged shortcomings.\n180: The applicants alleged that the conditions in which they spent 23 days in the Röszke transit zone had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. Before the Grand Chamber, they also relied on Article 8 of the Convention in respect of the same complaint.\n181: The Court considers that the above complaint falls to be examined under Article 3 only. This provision reads as follows:\n182: The Chamber, noting, in particular, the findings of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture concerning the satisfactory material conditions at the zone and the relatively short period spent by the applicants there, found that there had been no violation of Article 3.\n183: The applicants considered that the Chamber had attached undue weight to the general material conditions, failed to have regard to the fact that the CPT had found them acceptable for a very short stay only and had not sufficiently taken into consideration the applicants’ vulnerability. In respect of the latter, the applicants submitted to the Grand Chamber additional information, alleging, in particular, harsh conditions and illtreatment endured by the first applicant during the 1990’s and until 2010 or 2011 in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Bangladesh and, as regard the second applicant, in Pakistan, Dubai, Iran and Turkey between 2010 and 2013 (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Alternatively, the applicants invited the Grand Chamber to examine under Article 8 their complaint of the conditions in the transit zone and find a violation of that provision.\n184: The respondent Government agreed with the Chamber’s application of the threshold of severity rule and its finding that the applicants were not more vulnerable than any other adult asylum-seeker. Distinguishing the present case from the situation that led the Court to find violations of Article 3 in M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, the Hungarian Government pointed out that the applicants’ basic needs, such as food, hygiene, shelter and access to medical aid had been taken care of. Even if those conditions were considered to fall short of some of the requirements of the EU’s Reception Conditions Directive, that would not constitute a violation of Article 3. The Government warned against elevating the requirements of that provision in the reception context beyond the requisite catering for the most basic human needs, given, in particular, that transit zones provide only temporary accommodation. As regards the applicants’ allegations concerning their suffering in a number of Asian countries, the Government observed that they were articulated for the first time before the Grand Chamber and were unverifiable.\n185: Some of the intervening third parties also provided relevant comments. The UNHCR submitted factual information about the Rӧszke transit zone and summaries of relevant law and international standards regarding reception of asylum-seekers. In their joint intervention, the five Italian scholars dealt with the concept of vulnerability with emphasis on international and human rights law. They demonstrated that variants of this concept had been used in different contexts without a definition of vulnerability and urged the Court to develop relevant principles in this regard.\n186: It is undisputed that while at the Rӧszke transit zone, the applicants were fully dependent on the Hungarian authorities for their most basic human needs and were under their control.\n187: In these circumstances, it was the responsibility of the Hungarian authorities not to subject them to such conditions as would constitute inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, §§ 21622 and 263).\n188: According to the Court’s well-established case-law, illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of that level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, principally the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. In the context of confinement and living conditions of asylum-seekers, the Court has summarised the relevant general principles in the case of Khlaifia and Others (cited above, §§ 158-69).\n189: The Grand Chamber endorses the Chamber’s analysis in the present case regarding the physical conditions in which the applicants lived while confined to the transit zone. The Chamber stated the following, in particular, in paragraphs 84 and 85 of its judgment:\n190: The fact that the hygienic conditions were good and that persons staying at the Röszke zone were provided with food of a satisfactory quality and medical care if needed, and could spend their time outdoors was also confirmed at a later date, in the report of 13 October 2017 of the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe (see paragraph 67 above).\n191: Turning to the applicants’ vulnerability argument, the Court must examine the available evidence to establish whether, as alleged by them, they could be considered particularly vulnerable and, if so, whether the conditions in which they stayed at the Rӧszke transit zone in September and October 2015 were incompatible with any such vulnerability to the extent that these conditions constituted inhuman and degrading treatment with specific regard to the applicants.\n192: The Grand Chamber endorses the Chamber’s view that while it is true that asylum-seekers may be considered vulnerable because of everything they might have been through during their migration and the traumatic experiences they were likely to have endured previously (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 232), there is no indication that the applicants in the present case were more vulnerable than any other adult asylum-seeker confined to the Rӧszke transit zone in September 2015 (see paragraph 87 of the Chamber judgment). In particular, their allegations about hardship and ill-treatment endured in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Dubai and Turkey concern a period of time which ended in 2010 or 2011 for the first applicant and in 2013 for the second applicant (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Also, the Court does not consider that the psychiatrist’s opinion (see paragraph 30 above) submitted by the applicants is decisive: having regard to its context and content, and taking into consideration that the applicants stayed at the Rӧszke transit zone for the relatively short period of 23 days, the psychiatrist’s observations cannot lead to the conclusion that the otherwise acceptable conditions at the Rӧszke transit zone were particularly ill-suited in the applicants’ individual circumstances to such an extent as to amount to ill-treatment contrary to Article 3.\n193: The Court also considers that even if the applicants must have been affected by the uncertainty as to whether they were in detention and whether legal safeguards against arbitrary detention applied, the shortness of the relevant period and the fact that the applicants were aware of the procedural developments in the asylum procedure, which unfolded without delays, indicate that the negative effect of any such uncertainty on them must have been limited.\n194: In sum, taking into consideration, in particular, the material conditions at the zone, the length of the applicants’ stay there, and the possibilities for human contact with other asylum-seekers, UNHCR representatives, NGOs and a lawyer, the Court finds that the situation complained of did not reach the minimum level of severity necessary to constitute inhuman treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. Therefore, there has been no violation of that provision.\n195: The applicants complained that they were confined to the transit zone in violation of those provisions, which provide, in so far as relevant:\n196: The Chamber held that the applicants’ confinement to the transit zone constituted a de facto deprivation of liberty. It took into account the fact that the applicants were placed in a guarded compound which could not be accessed from the outside and which they could not leave towards Hungary, nor towards Serbia without forfeiting their asylum claims and running the risk of refoulement. As to the merits of the complaint under Article 5 § 1, the Chamber held that the applicants’ detention could not be considered “lawful”, as the underlying domestic rules were not sufficiently precise and foreseeable and the detention had occurred de facto, as a matter of practical arrangement, without a formal decision and therefore without providing reasons. The Chamber also found a violation of Article 5 § 4 because, in the absence of a decision which they could have challenged, the applicants could not seek any judicial review of their detention.\n197: In relation to the applicability of Article 5, the applicants emphasised that the fact that they had entered the transit zone of their own free will was not relevant since, once there, they could not return to Serbia, where they were not welcome and risked chain-refoulement without an examination of their asylum requests on the merits.\n198: The applicants submitted that the Government’s allegation that they were not “genuine” asylum-seekers as they did not risk persecution in Bangladesh should not have any bearing on the question whether they were detained unlawfully in Hungary. As registered asylum-seekers they had the right to wait for a decision under adequate procedural safeguards, including as regards detention. During the waiting period they were not allowed to leave the transit zone in the direction of Hungary and could not do so in the direction of Serbia as they would have been refused re-entry. The applicants submitted written statements by staff of an NGO who had witnessed the Hungarian authorities’ refusal to admit back, through the door they had just passed, asylum-seekers who had received an inadmissibility decision, had been told to leave in the direction of Serbia, then learned of the possibility to appeal and wanted to re-enter and appeal.\n199: As regards compliance with Article 5 § 1, the applicants submitted that section 71/A of the Asylum Act, invoked by the Government as the legal basis for their detention, did not meet the requirement of quality of the law. The total absence of clear, precise and foreseeable laws on the conditions and procedural safeguards relating to their confinement to the transit zone as a form of detention rendered it devoid of legal basis. They were at no stage served with a decision ordering their deprivation of liberty. However, the authorities had at their disposal legal means to impose detention if they considered it necessary for the proper functioning of the asylum system, including prevention of forum shopping.\n200: As regards Article 5 § 4, the applicants disputed the Government’s assertion that the Szeged court could examine the lawfulness of the choice to apply the transit zone border procedure and thus secure the requisite review of lawfulness. That court had not examined the issue of the applicability of the border procedure and it could not in any way review the lawfulness of the placement in the transit zone as a measure of deprivation of liberty.\n201: According to the respondent Government, the applicants were free to leave in the direction of Serbia and, moreover, had at their disposal alternative routes via Serbia to their preferred destination – Western Europe, as evidenced by the fact that they found such routes. While the applicants were not free to move in Hungary, this was inherent in normal border procedures. The length of the pre-entry waiting period depended on the complexity of the case, the cooperation of the asylum-seekers and the consistency of their statements. For the duration of this process, the applicants were provided with decent waiting conditions in a transit zone. Such zones should not be confused with reception centres for refugees whose entitlement to legal protection has been established.\n202: The applicants did not have a “right” to enter Hungary. A right to admission can be inferred in international law only in respect of refugees arriving directly from the State of persecution, or in case of a direct threat to their lives and physical integrity. In the light of Article 1 of the Convention, its Article 5 should be interpreted as meaning that when individuals are not brought within the jurisdiction of the State but voluntarily apply for admission to that jurisdiction, the resulting “confinement” to a waiting zone (that they are free to leave) prior to admission is not a de facto detention but an inherent limitation on the freedom of movement. Such a limitation is not arbitrary if the denial of admission is not arbitrary. Therefore, there is no issue under Article 5 separate from the denial of admission, examined in the present case under Article 3.\n203: The Government further submitted that border transit zones are fundamentally different from airport transit zones. The latter are an enclave deep into the territory of the State, whereas border transit zones are open towards the territory of the neighbouring State from which the applicants have arrived. In contrast to the case of Amuur v. France (25 June 1996, Reports 1996III), the applicants’ return to Serbia did not require negotiations with the Serbian authorities, who do not stop aliens from re-entering, and did not involve financial or practical obstacles. Unsuccessful asylum-seekers routinely leave the zone. The fact that the applicants did eventually leave for Serbia without adverse consequences indicates that they were not in detention in Hungary. Unlike in Amuur, the applicants’ freedom to leave the zone was not theoretical as they could return to a State bound by the Geneva Convention and the ECHR, offering comparable protection.\n204: The Government further considered that the applicants did not run the risk of refoulement to a persecuting country because they were not persecuted in their own country of origin or in the transit countries. Moreover, by returning to Serbia they did not waive international protection because such protection under the Geneva Convention was not denied to asylum-seekers having voluntarily returned to Serbia (in case they requested such protection and remained in Serbia until the delivery of the decision). The Chamber had failed to distinguish the present case from Riad and Idiab v. Belgium (nos. 29787/03 and 29810/03, § 68, 24 January 2008), where the applicants had been confined to a transit zone not upon their arrival in the country but more than one month later, by decision of the authorities. However, no Hungarian authority compelled the applicants to enter the transit zone.\n205: The Government submitted that the applicants’ accommodation in the transit zone had a legal basis in Hungarian law, including guarantees against arbitrariness and aimed at preventing an unauthorised entry in accordance with Article 5 § 1(f). In particular, section 71/A of the Asylum Act read together with section 15/A of the Act on State Borders provided for the examination of asylum applications in transit zones for temporary accommodation. Section 71/A § 2 made clear that in border procedures the applicants did not have the right to freedom of movement in Hungary. As a guarantee against arbitrariness, the law limited border procedure and stay in the transit zone to four weeks: according to § 4 of section 71/A, failing a decision within four weeks, entry to the territory of Hungary was to be granted. As a further guarantee against arbitrariness, border proceedings were not applicable to persons eligible for preferential treatment, such as vulnerable persons.\n206: There was no violation of Article 5 § 4 since the restriction of the applicants’ liberty was subject to judicial review as part of the judicial review of the asylum authority’s decision on the applicability of the rules on border procedures, including on the applicants’ ineligibility to preferential treatment. The first judicial review in the applicants’ case was carried out within six days of their arrival.\n207: The Polish Government considered that placement in a facility from which a foreigner may freely move should not be automatically treated as de facto deprivation of liberty. They also noted that the present case concerned the practice of EU Member States in the difficult times of the migration crisis and stressed, in that regard, that the EU legal order secures respect for fundamental rights, including through supervision and control by the EU institutions.\n208: The Russian Government criticised the Amuur judgment for having introduced a new criterion in the assessment whether the deprivation of liberty was arbitrary or not: the “place and conditions” of detention. No such a criterion was to be found in Article 5. Only Article 3 was concerned with conditions of detention. Furthermore, the Court’s approach wrongly assimilated refusal to allow entry to the State territory to a deprivation of liberty. In the Russian Government’s view, by failing to make distinctions based on the grounds on which asylum is claimed, the Court was blurring the distinction between migrants and refugees, undermining the protection the latter need.\n209: The UNHCR provided factual information about the Rӧszke transit zone and summaries of the relevant Hungarian law, EU law and international standards regarding reception of asylum-seekers.\n210: It is undisputed that under Hungarian law the applicants’ stay at the Röszke transit zone was not considered as detention. The parties disagree, however, on whether it nevertheless constituted a de facto deprivation of liberty and, consequently, whether Article 5 of the Convention applied.\n211: In proclaiming the “right to liberty”, paragraph 1 of Article 5 contemplates the physical liberty of the person. Accordingly, it is not concerned with mere restrictions on liberty of movement, which are governed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, with regard to persons lawfully within the territory of the State. Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task, in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, § 64, with the references therein).\n212: In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5, the starting-point must be his or her specific situation in reality and account must be taken of a whole range of factors such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 225, ECHR 2012, and Gahramanov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), no. 26291/06, § 40, 15 October 2013). The difference between deprivation and restriction of liberty is one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance (see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, § 80, 23 February 2017, with the references therein; see also Kasparov v. Russia, no. 53659/07, § 36, 11 October 2016).\n213: The Court considers that in drawing the distinction between a restriction on liberty of movement and deprivation of liberty in the context of the situation of asylum seekers, its approach should be practical and realistic, having regard to the present-day conditions and challenges. It is important in particular to recognise the States’ right, subject to their international obligations, to control their borders and to take measures against foreigners circumventing restrictions on immigration.\n214: The question whether staying at airport international zones amounts to deprivation of liberty has been dealt with in a number of cases (see, among those: Amuur, cited above, § 43; Shamsa v. Poland, nos. 45355/99 and 45357/99, § 47, 27 November 2003; Mogoş v. Romania (dec.), no. 20420/02, 6 May 2004; Mahdid and Haddar v. Austria (dec.), no. 74762/01, ECHR 2005-XIII (extracts); Riad and Idiab, cited above, § 68; Nolan and K. v. Russia, no. 2512/04, §§ 93-96, 12 February 2009; and Gahramanov, cited above, §§ 35-47).\n215: The Court stated the following in the case of Amuur, at § 43:\n216: The applicability of Article 5 has also been examined with regard to stays in reception centres for the identification and registration of migrants, located on islands at the Italian and Greek shores (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, §§ 65-72, which concerns irregular migrants, and J.R. and Others v. Greece, no. 22696/16, 25 January 2018, which concerns asylum-seekers). In the latter case, where initially an official detention order had been issued in respect of the applicants, the Court took into consideration, in particular, changes in the applicants’ legal situation under domestic law and a change in the regime at the reception centre from “closed” to “semi-open” in order to distinguish between two periods, the first of which attracted the application of Article 5 and the second did not (ibid., §§ 85-87).\n217: In determining the distinction between a restriction on liberty of movement and deprivation of liberty in the context of confinement of foreigners in airport transit zones and reception centres for the identification and registration of migrants, the factors taken into consideration by the Court may be summarised as follows: i) the applicants’ individual situation and their choices, ii) the applicable legal regime of the respective country and its purpose, iii) the relevant duration, especially in the light of the purpose and the procedural protection enjoyed by applicants pending the events, and iv) the nature and degree of the actual restrictions imposed on or experienced by the applicants (see the cases cited in the preceding three paragraphs).\n218: The Court considers that the factors outlined above are also relevant, mutatis mutandis, in the present case.\n219: The present case concerns, apparently for the first time, a transit zone located on the land border between two member States of the Council of Europe, where asylum-seekers had to stay pending the examination of the admissibility of their asylum requests. The specific purpose, as well the physical and legal characteristics of such transit zones will inevitably have an impact on the Court’s analysis of the applicability of Article 5.\n220: The Court observes, first, that the applicants entered the Röszke transit zone of their own initiative, with the aim of seeking asylum in Hungary. While this fact in itself does not exclude the possibility of the applicants finding themselves in a situation of de facto deprivation of liberty after having entered, the Court considers that it is a relevant consideration, to be looked at in the light of all other circumstances of the case.\n221: It is true that in a number of cases the Court stated that detention might violate Article 5 of the Convention even though the person concerned had agreed to it and emphasised that the right to liberty is too important for a person to lose the benefit of the protection of the Convention for the single reason that he gave himself up to be taken into detention (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 18 June 1971, § 65, Series A, no. 12; I.I. v. Bulgaria, no. 44082/98, §§ 84-87, 9 June 2005; Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, § 48, 9 November 2010; Venskutė v. Lithuania, no. 10645/08, § 72, 11 December 2012; and Buzadji v. Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, §§ 106-10, 5 July 2016). The cases cited above, however, concerned situations where the law provided for deprivation of liberty or situations where the applicants had complied with an obligation, such as, among others, to enter a prison or a police station or submit to house arrest. The circumstances are not the same, in the Court’s view, where the applicants – as in the present case – had no relevant prior link to the State concerned and no obligation to which they acquiesced but requested admission to that State’s territory of their own initiative and sought asylum there. In such cases the starting point regarding the applicants’ individual position visàvis the authorities is entirely different.\n222: In the present case, having regard to the known facts about the applicants and their journey from Bangladesh to Hungary, there is no doubt that they entered the Röszke transit zone of their own initiative. It is also clear that, at all events, the Hungarian authorities were entitled to do the necessary verifications and examine their claims before deciding whether or not to admit them.\n223: Finally, the Court also notes that the applicants did not cross the border from Serbia because of a direct and immediate danger for their life or health in that country but did so of their free will.\n224: Second, it is also relevant that the rationale and purpose of the domestic legal regime applicable to the Röszke transit zone was to put in place a waiting area while the authorities decided whether to formally admit the asylum-seekers to Hungary (see paragraph 41 above and, in particular, Section 71/A of the Hungarian Asylum Act). Albeit not decisive in itself, it is relevant to note that the Hungarian authorities did not seek to deprive the applicants of their liberty and that they ordered them to leave Hungary on the very day of their entry (see paragraph 8 above). The applicants remained in the transit zone essentially because they appealed against the expulsion order (see paragraphs 20-37 above).\n225: The right of States to control the entry of foreigners into their territory necessarily implies that admission authorisation may be conditional on compliance with relevant requirements. Therefore, absent other significant factors, the situation of an individual applying for entry and waiting for a short period for the verification of his or her right to enter cannot be described as deprivation of liberty imputable to the State, since in such cases the State authorities have undertaken vis-à-vis the individual no other steps than reacting to his or her wish to enter by carrying out the necessary verifications (see, mutatis mutandis, Gahramanov, cited above, §§ 35-47; see also Mahdid and Haddar (dec.), cited above, where the applicants’ asylum requests were dismissed in an airport transit zone within three days and the Court found that there had been no deprivation of liberty (taking into consideration additional factors, such as that the applicants were not under constant police control)).\n226: It is further relevant that, in line with the purpose of the domestic legal regime, procedural guarantees concerning the processing of asylum claims and provisions fixing the maximum duration of asylum seekers’ stay in the transit zone applied to the applicants’ case (see paragraphs 41 and 205 above). These guarantees were implemented and the applicants spent twenty-three days at the Rӧszke transit zone, during which time their asylum requests were processed at administrative and judicial level.\n227: In the Court’s case-law concerning confinement of aliens in an immigration context, the duration of the relevant restriction on movement and the link between the actions of the authorities and the restricted freedom may be elements affecting the classification of the situation as amounting to deprivation of liberty or not (see, mutatis mutandis, Amuur, § 43, cited above; Gahramanov, cited above, §§ 35-47, and Mahdid and Haddar, cited above). However, the Court considers that in situations generally similar to those in the present case, as long as the applicants’ stay in the transit zone does not exceed significantly the time needed for the examination of an asylum request and there are no exceptional circumstances, the duration in itself should not affect the Court’s analysis on the applicability of Article 5 in a decisive manner. That is particularly so where the individuals, while waiting for the processing of their asylum claims, benefitted from procedural rights and safeguards against excessive waiting periods. The presence of domestic legal regulation limiting the length of stay in the transit zone is of significant importance in this regard.\n228: In the present case, the Court observes that the Hungarian authorities were working in conditions of a mass influx of asylum-seekers and migrants at the border, which necessitated rapidly putting in place measures to deal with what was clearly a crisis situation. Despite the ensuing very significant difficulties, the applicants’ asylum claims and their judicial appeals were examined within three weeks and two days (see paragraphs 8 and 20-37 above).\n229: The Court thus considers that the applicants’ situation was not influenced by any inaction of the Hungarian authorities and that no action was imputable to them other than what was strictly necessary to verify whether the applicants’ wish to enter Hungary to seek asylum there could be granted.\n230: Nonetheless, the Court must also verify whether the actual restrictions imposed on or experienced by the applicants had the effect, despite the above, of placing them in a situation of de facto deprivation of liberty.\n231: The Court notes, on the one hand, that individuals staying at the Röszke transit zone were not permitted to leave in the direction of the remaining territory of Hungary, the country where the zone was located (compare and contrast Mogoş, cited above). This is unsurprising having regard to the very purpose of the transit zone as a waiting area while the authorities decided whether to formally admit asylum-seekers to Hungary.\n232: At the relevant time the Röszke transit zone covered a very limited surface, was surrounded by a fence and barbed wire and was fully guarded, which excluded free outward or inward movement. Inside the zone, the applicants could communicate with other asylum-seekers and could receive visits, such as by their lawyer, with the authorities’ permission. They could spend time outdoors on a narrow strip of land in front of the containers serving as dormitories (see paragraphs 15, 65 and 67 above). The Court finds that, overall, the size of the area and the manner in which it was controlled were such that the applicants’ freedom of movement was restricted to a very significant degree, in a manner similar to that characteristic of certain types of light-regime detention facilities.\n233: The Court takes account of the fact, on the other hand, that while waiting for the procedural steps made necessary by their application for asylum, the applicants lived in conditions which, albeit involving a significant restriction on their freedom of movement, did not limit their liberty unnecessarily or to an extent or in a manner unconnected to the examination of their asylum claims. The Court also recalls that it dismissed the applicants’ complaint that these conditions were inhuman and degrading (see paragraph 194 above). Finally, the applicants spent only twenty-three days in the zone, a period which – as the Court found – did not exceed what was strictly necessary to verify whether the applicants’ wish to enter Hungary to seek asylum there could be granted.\n234: The remaining question is whether the applicants could leave the transit zone in a direction other than the territory of Hungary.\n235: In this regard, the Court observes, in the first place, that during the relevant period many persons in the applicants’ situation returned from the Rӧszke transit zone to Serbia, at least some of them voluntarily, as confirmed, inter alia, by relevant accounts from non-governmental organisations (see paragraph 71 above). This fact does not appear to be disputed by the applicants.\n236: It is further significant that, in contrast to, for example, persons confined to an airport transit zone (see § 214 above), those placed in a land border transit zone, as the applicants in the present case, do not need to board an airplane in order to return to the country from which they came. The applicants came from Serbia, the territory of which was immediately adjacent to the transit zone area. In practical terms, therefore, the possibility for them to leave the Rӧszke land border transit zone was not only theoretical but realistic. Indeed, unlike the case of Amuur (cited above), where the French courts described the applicants’ confinement as an “arbitrary deprivation of liberty” (ibid., § 45), in the present case the Hungarian authorities were apparently convinced that the applicants could realistically leave in the direction of Serbia.\n237: It is probable that the applicants had no legal right to enter Serbia. The Court notes, however, that Serbia was bound at the relevant time by a readmission agreement concluded with the European Union (see paragraph 59 above). While it is not for the Court to interpret this agreement and decide whether or not the applicants’ case was covered by its provisions, it considers that the de facto possibility of them leaving the transit zone for Serbia existed, not only in theory but also in practice. This is confirmed by the fact that the applicants and, during the same period, many other persons in a similar situation, did eventually leave the zone and entered Serbia.\n238: The applicants argued, in addition, that they were unable to return to the country they came from, in this case Serbia, because of a real risk of grave consequences. The respondent Government disputed this claim, emphasising that Serbia was a safe country and in any event the applicants were not persecuted in their country of origin, Bangladesh.\n239: The Court recalls its reasoning in the case of Amuur (cited above), where it stated that “the mere fact that it is possible for asylum-seekers to leave voluntarily the country where they wish to take refuge cannot exclude a restriction on liberty” and noted that the possibility to leave “becomes theoretical if no other country offering protection comparable to the protection they expect to find in the country where they are seeking asylum is inclined or prepared to take them in” (ibid., § 48).\n240: In the Court’s view this reasoning in Amuur must be read in close relation to the factual and legal context in that case, which concerned a situation where the applicants could not leave the airport zone, neither in theory nor in practice, without authorisation to board an airplane and without diplomatic assurances concerning their only possible destination, Syria, a country “not bound by the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees” (ibid). Overcoming these obstacles or mitigating the consequences related thereto was only possible, if at all, through actions of the authorities and did not depend on the applicants’ will. Similarly, in J.R. and Others v. Greece (cited above), the applicants could not leave to the direction of Turkey, the country from which they came, otherwise than by boarding a vessel.\n241: In the present case, in contrast, it was practically possible for the applicants to walk to the border and cross into Serbia, a country bound by the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (see paragraph 72 above).\n242: It is further of relevance that what the applicants feared in case of return to Serbia, as explained in their submissions to the Court regarding Article 3 (see paragraphs 100-107 above), was not a direct threat to their life or health but deficiencies in the functioning of Serbia’s asylum system and the ensuing risk of their removal from Serbia to two other Contracting States, the Republic of North Macedonia or Greece, without a proper examination of their asylum claims.\n243: The Court cannot accept that these fears alone, despite all other circumstances in the present case (which, as explained above, are different from those obtaining in the cases concerning airport transit zones), were sufficient to bring Article 5 into application. Such an interpretation of the applicability of Article 5 would stretch the concept of deprivation of liberty beyond its meaning intended by the Convention.\n244: The prohibition of ill-treatment in case of removal of an asylum seeker is an issue under Article 3 of the Convention which imposes on the Contracting States stringent substantive and procedural duties, some of which form part of the subject-matter of the present case (see paragraphs 100-165 above). In particular, asylum seekers cannot be removed to a country where they run a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. Failing to abide by this provision, including by the procedural obligation to examine thoroughly all potential risks, entails the responsibility of the relevant Contracting State for its violation.\n245: It is true that there is a link between the rights under Article 3 and those under Article 5 of the Convention, in that, in particular, independent judicial scrutiny of deprivation of liberty, required by Article 5 §§ 3 and 4, is essential to the prevention of life-threatening acts or serious ill-treatment in detention (see, Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, § 123, Reports 1998III). This link concerns, however, a very different context.\n246: In the Court’s view, where – as in the present case – the sum of all other relevant factors did not point to a situation of de facto deprivation of liberty and it was possible for the asylum seekers, without a direct threat for their life or health, known by or brought to the attention of the authorities at the relevant time, to return to the third intermediary country they had come from, Article 5 could not be seen as applicable to their situation in a land border transit zone where they awaited the examination of their asylum claims, on the ground that the authorities had not complied with their separate duties under Article 3. The Convention cannot be read as linking in such a manner the applicability of Article 5 to a separate issue concerning the authorities’ compliance with Article 3.\n247: It is true that, pursuant to section 66 (2) d) of the Asylum Act (see paragraph 41 above), the applicants would have forfeited the examination of their asylum claims in Hungary if they left prior to the final decision on their asylum requests. In this regard the Court finds unconvincing the Government’s argument, based on section 66(6) of the same law, that the applicants were free to spend time in Serbia and then have the asylum proceedings in Hungary resumed if they came back to the transit zone within nine months. No such example has been cited by the respondent Government and there is nothing to indicate that the applicants were informed of such a possibility when they were at the Röszke transit zone. To the contrary, as confirmed by the respondent Government in their written observations to the Grand Chamber, the applicants had to remain at the disposal of the Hungarian asylum authorities and, therefore, in the transit zone, pending examination of the admissibility of their asylum requests, which, moreover, depended on an assessment of whether they could safely be returned to Serbia.\n248: The Court reiterates however that, in the absence of a direct threat to the applicants’ life or health, known by or brought to the attention of the Hungarian authorities at the relevant time, the discontinuation of the applicants’ asylum proceedings in Hungary was a legal issue which did not affect their physical liberty to move out of the transit zone by walking into Serbian territory. In the circumstances of the present case and in contrast to the situation that obtained in some of the cases concerning airport transit zones, and notably in Amuur (cited above), the risk of the applicants’ forfeiting the examination of their asylum claims in Hungary and their fears about insufficient access to asylum procedures in Serbia, while relevant with regard to Article 3, did not render the applicants’ possibility of leaving the transit zone in the direction of Serbia merely theoretical. Therefore, it did not have the effect of making the applicants’ stay in the transit zone involuntary from the standpoint of Article 5 and, consequently, could not trigger, of itself, the applicability of that provision.\n249: The Court thus finds that, having regard to all the circumstances of the present case analysed above, the applicants were not deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article 5. Therefore, this provision did not apply.\n250: It follows that the applicants’ complaints under Article 5 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention are incompatible ratione materiae with its provisions. The Court also reiterates that under Article 35 § 4 of the Convention, it may dismiss applications which it considers inadmissible “at any stage of the proceedings” and that, therefore, subject to Rule 55 of the Rules of Court, the Grand Chamber may reconsider a decision to declare an application admissible (see the case-law cited in paragraph 80 above).\n251: The Court thus holds that this part of the application must be declared inadmissible in accordance with Article 35 § 3 (a) and 4.\n252: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n253: The Chamber awarded 10,000 euros (EUR) to each applicant on account of non-pecuniary damage.\n254: Before the Grand Chamber the applicants claimed, as they did before the Chamber, EUR 15,000 each in respect of non-pecuniary damage. The Government invited the Court to reject the applicants’ claim as being excessive.\n255: The Court considers that the applicants must have suffered nonpecuniary damage as a result of the procedural violation of Article 3 of the Convention found in the present case. Having regard to the relevant circumstances of the case, it awards EUR 5,000 to each applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n256: Before the Chamber the applicants claimed EUR 8,705 for 57.5 hours of legal work at the hourly rate of EUR 150 plus EUR 80 in clerical expenses. The Chamber awarded this claim in full.\n257: Before the Grand Chamber the applicants reiterated the above claim and also claimed, in respect of the Grand Chamber proceedings, an additional EUR 17,625 for 117.5 hours of legal work at the hourly rate of EUR 150. They submitted a time sheet indicating the sum of hours without further detail. The applicants’ claim in respect of cost and expenses thus amounted to EUR 26,330 in total.\n258: The Government submitted that the expenses claimed were neither necessarily incurred nor reasonable as to quantum having regard to the number of irrelevant submissions made by the applicants.\n259: According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria and taking into consideration that most of the applicants’ complaints have been rejected, the Court considers it reasonable to award EUR 18,000 in respect of all costs and expenses.\n260: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

                "CASE OF R.R. AND OTHERS v. HUNGARY; § 1: The case concerns the confinement of an Iranian-Afghan family, including three minor children, to the Röszke transit zone at the border of Hungary and Serbia between 19 April and 15 August 2017. The applicants relied on Article 3 (conditions in the transit zone), taken alone and in conjunction with Article 13, Article 5 (unlawful deprivation of liberty) and Article 34 (non-compliance with an interim measure).\n2: The applicants are an Iranian-Afghan family of five. Their details are set out in the appendix. They were represented before the Court by Ms B. Pohárnok, a lawyer practising in Budapest.\n3: The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z. Tallódi, of the Ministry of Justice.\n4: The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n5: S.H. (“the applicant mother”) claims that she was a victim of torture in Afghanistan; she was allegedly captured, burned and raped by the Taliban, who killed her first husband. On an unknown date between 2012 and 2014 she fled Afghanistan to Iran together with her two daughters from her first marriage, M.H. and R.H. She met R.R. (“the first applicant”) there, and entered into a religious marriage with him.\n6: R.R., S.H. and her two children left Iran in the beginning of 2016, allegedly escaping reprisals because R.R. had deserted the Iranian army. Having left Iran, they travelled together through Turkey to Greece, where they were separated. R.R. made it to Austria, but allegedly decided to join his family, who were returned to Greece after being arrested in North Macedonia. On 11 March 2016 R.R. was apprehended at Sopron railway station in Hungary. He applied for asylum. On 21 March 2016 he withdrew his asylum application and the asylum proceedings were terminated. Pending enforcement of his expulsion to Iran, the first applicant was held in immigrant detention, where he submitted his second asylum application. On 3 August 2016 he left for an unknown destination and the asylum proceedings were terminated.\n7: Subsequently, the applicant family were reunited in Serbia. They spent several months in different camps around the country. On 16 October 2016 A.R., the first biological child of R.R. and S.H., was born.\n8: On 19 April 2017 the applicants arrived in Hungary from Serbia and entered the Röszke transit zone, which is situated on Hungarian territory at the border between the two countries. They applied for asylum on the same date.\n9: On 19 April 2017 the Office for Immigration and Asylum (hereinafter “the IAO”) issued a ruling ordering that the applicants be accommodated in the Röszke transit zone under section 80/J(5) of the Asylum Act (see paragraph 24 below).\n10: Since 2015 the two transit zones located at the border with Serbia have been significantly enlarged (see Ilias and Ahmed v. Hungary [GC], no. 47287/15, § 15, 21 November 2019). According to data collected by the Government in July 2017, at the time in question the Röszke transit zone had an official capacity of 460 places and was accommodating 291 foreign nationals. The sections of the transit zone were rectangular in shape, with accommodation “containers” placed adjacent to each other on three sides and a wire mesh fence on the fourth. There was razor wire on the roofs of the containers. People staying in one section could only go to other parts of the zone to see a doctor, a lawyer or IAO staff, and were always escorted by guards.\n11: The applicants initially stayed in the section of the Röszke transit zone designated for families. They were placed together in a 13squaremetre living container, which had three bunk beds without child safety rails and five lockable cabinets. According to the Government, a cot bed was provided to families with small children. According to the applicants, the containers were extremely hot in summer and without air conditioning; for ventilation they had to open the window and door, which made the room draughty and allowed insects in. An awning over the front door (to offer shade) and fans were provided in August 2017.\n12: In the middle of the family section there was a communal courtyard with a small playground for children, ping-pong table, badminton net, basketball court and goals for football. According to the applicants, there was no shade or greenery in the outdoor area. The section also had a playroom, study room, room for religious worship and common room equipped with a television. The NGOs working within the zone organised activities for children, such as drawing and crafts, once or twice a week for one to two hours. From September 2017 an education programme for children in the transit zone was provided.\n13: On 29 June 2017 the applicants were moved to an isolation section within the transit zone because the applicant mother and children had hepatitis B. The isolation section consisted of approximately ten mobile containers placed in a row and a narrow (approximately 2.5 metres wide and 40 to 50 metres long) open-air area surrounded by fencing. Their living container, which was equipped with air conditioning, was furnished with one bunk bed, two single beds (no cot bed for A.R.) and a chest of drawers. There was no refrigerator, microwave or washing machine in the section. The applicants were given sand for the children to play with. There was no playground and no activities were organised for the children in the isolation section. The applicants had access to a television in the common area container and a ping-pong table.\n14: The police regularly carried out morning (6 a.m.) checks – headcounts. The applicants submitted that the police officers/guards had often raided their living containers to perform security checks.\n15: Free wireless Internet was available in the transit zone. According to the applicants, the connection was poor and could only be used for messaging.\n16: According to the Government, children were, in addition to the three meals provided to adult asylum-seekers, provided with two snacks each per day. Like pregnant women, they were also entitled to dairy products and fruit. Children under the age of one were provided infant nutrition and baby food. The applicants submitted that the children had been given chocolate bars for snacks and that fruit had only been provided occasionally. They submitted that the food provided to the children had been inadequate for their age.\n17: Upon their arrival at the transit zone, families were provided with a sanitary package, including essential baby hygiene products such as disposable nappies. An additional monthly sanitary package was provided to asylum-seekers and, in justified cases, additional items were provided on request. According to the Government, clothing was provided to asylumseekers who did not have appropriate clothing for the season. The applicants submitted that the applicant mother had not been provided with maternity clothes, so she had had to sew a dress for herself using bed linen.\n18: The applicants received medical treatment on several occasions during their stay in the transit zone. The Government submitted that asylum-seekers were entitled to basic and emergency medical care, including specialist medical treatment, according to their needs. If justified by their health condition, the resident medical staff could transfer them to hospitals or clinics to obtain urgent or specialist care. On 24 April 2017 the applicant mother was examined by a gynaecologist of a Szeged hospital. On 25 April 2017 she was referred to the emergency department of the hospital because of sickness. On 28 April 2017 she was taken to the hospital to have her pregnancy determined. She underwent blood and laboratory tests in relation to her hepatitis B and was prescribed medication for a urinary tract infection. On the same date she was taken to the emergency department of the hospital because of vomiting and cramps. She spent the night there. On 26 May 2017 she attended a prenatal checkup in the hospital and was found to have a high-risk pregnancy. On 13 and 14 June 2017 she was taken to the hospital and prescribed medication for epigastric (abdominal) pain. On 3 July 2017 she had another check-up in the hospital and a consultation took place in relation to her hepatitis B. On 9 August 2017 she attended an ultrasound appointment and was taken to the emergency department of the hospital. She was recommended a high fluid intake and adequate nutrition (fruit), and was prescribed medication for anaemia. Following the family’s release from the transit zone, the applicant mother attended two more medical check-ups. On 24 April and 6 July 2017 the two eldest applicant children were taken to the paediatrics department of the hospital in Szeged. Their hepatitis B was confirmed following blood tests taken during their second visit to the hospital and the doctor suggested a further examination at the hepatology department. On 29 June 2017 the eldest applicant child, M.H., was examined at the ear, nose and throat department of the hospital in Szeged because of frequent nosebleeds. On 16 August 2017 she was taken to the emergency department of a hospital in Győr by ambulance and was subsequently treated at the ear, nose and throat department. The applicants submitted that, although requested, the youngest applicant child had not been given the vaccines recommended at six months. It appears from the case file that she had received some vaccines in Serbia and that the next vaccination appointment was scheduled for 8 April 2017.\n19: The applicants submitted that no interpreter had been present in the course of S.H.’s medical examinations and that no anamnesis (medical history) could be collected from her due to the language constraints (she spoke only in her mother tongue). At her hospital visit of 9 August 2017 a “heteroanamnesis” was taken by questioning an interpreter using English and Dari at the doctor’s request. The applicants also submitted that they had always been taken to the hospital in an unsuitable police van and escorted by armed police officers, who had remained present during the medical examinations. In particular, (male) armed police officers had been present (standing by her side) during the second applicant’s gynaecological examination.\n20: As regards psychological assistance in the transit zone, the applicants submitted that there had been no assistance for traumatised asylum-seekers. They drew the Court’s attention to their lawyer’s submissions in the asylum procedure of 26 and 27 July 2017. With respect to the applicant mother, the lawyer submitted, inter alia, that she had been subjected to serious ill-treatment in Afghanistan, the consequences of which she was still suffering, and that she was in need of specialist treatment. In this connection, the lawyer also submitted that, given her mental health problems, the applicant mother had been under psychiatric treatment (medication and psychotherapy) during her stay in Serbia and requested that she be examined by a psychiatrist. In their application form, the applicants submitted that S.H. had had to stop taking that medication because of her pregnancy. The Government submitted that during the period in question the Hungarian Calvinist Charity Service and specialists from Sirius Help had provided psychosocial assistance in the transit zone, the latter specifically for children. On 24 August 2017, at the request of the applicants’ lawyer for the purposes of their legal (asylum) procedures, the applicant mother was examined by a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her with major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). The psychiatrist recommended that the applicant mother undergo medical, psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment, as otherwise suicidal urges and impulsive reactions were likely to occur. On the same date the two eldest applicant children were examined, at their lawyer’s request, by a psychologist, who observed that they showed signs of PTSD related to their experience in the transit zone and opined that psychological support should be made available to them.\n21: As R.R. had already applied for asylum in Hungary before entering the transit zone with his family (see paragraph 6 above), he was considered by the IAO not to be entitled to material reception conditions under the Asylum Act (see paragraph 24 below). He was assigned accommodation together with his family but was not given free meals. The hot meals provided to the other applicants could not be taken out of the canteen where they ate their lunch. The applicants submitted that the NGO Sirius Help, which had operated in the zone until the end of May 2017, had twice organised food shopping for R.R. from outside at the beginning of his stay. He had initially been able to get food by paying other asylum-seekers, who had bought the food in Serbia and delivered it to him upon their arrival at the zone. According to the applicants, such arrangements were difficult to achieve and R.R. was forced to eat his family’s leftovers, beg other asylumseekers for food and search for edible things in the rubbish bins. He could only recall two occasions when Charity Council organisations and the Hungarian Red Cross had provided him with non-perishable food packages. According to the Government, the other applicants were distributed sufficient amounts of long-life food which they could share with R.R. They also submitted that R.R. had several times bought food with the assistance of social workers and that members of the Charity Council had taken care of his needs, in terms of food, toiletries and clothing. According to the Government, R.R. refused to accept food several times, stating that the family had sufficient supplies. On 31 July 2017 the IAO sent an email to the applicants’ lawyer noting, in particular, that under the applicable Hungarian law the applicants were not entitled to food in the transit zone; they had the possibility to buy food for themselves, which they had done on multiple occasions, and charity organisations were handing out food. The IAO further noted that it did not appear that the first applicant had lost any weight during his stay in the zone.\n22: The applicants were represented by a lawyer of their choice in the asylum proceedings. The adult applicants were heard by the IAO on 19 April 2017 (both), on 8 June 2017 (only S.H.) and on 10 May and 6 June 2017 (only R.R.). In the course of the asylum proceedings, the IAO, inter alia, requested an expert opinion on their marriage certificate, which was delivered on 3 July 2017. On 20 June 2017 the IAO also requested a DNA test to verify that R.R. was the father of S.H.’s third child. The results of the test, which confirmed his paternity, were received on 14 August 2017.\n23: On 15 August 2017 the applicants were granted leave to enter and temporarily stay in the territory of Hungary (admitted alien status, befogadott). They were accommodated in the Vámosszabadi Reception Centre the same day. The IAO however refused to recognise them as refugees or persons in need of subsidiary protection. The applicants requested a judicial review of the part of the decision rejecting their applications. Subsequently, on 23 August 2017 the IAO issued a ruling withdrawing the decision on the merits. On 8 September 2017 it issued a new decision on the merits, recognising the applicants as persons in need of subsidiary protection. In the meantime, on 25 August 2017 the applicants left for Germany, where they were later granted international protection.\n24: The relevant provisions of Act no. LXXX of 2007 on Asylum (“the Asylum Act”) are outlined in the case of Ilias and Ahmed (cited above, §§ 41 and 45). For the purposes of the Asylum Act, persons deserving special treatment include vulnerable persons, in particular minors and pregnant women, who have been found to have special needs after an individual evaluation (section 2k)). According to section 4 of the Act, the best interests and rights of the child shall be a primary consideration when implementing the provisions. Moreover, provisions of the Asylum Act must be applied to persons requiring special treatment with due consideration of the specific needs arising from their situation (section 4(3)). When a crisis situation caused by mass immigration is declared, section 80/J of the Asylum Act, as amended on 28 March 2017, applies and provides as follows:\n25: All asylum applications submitted in the transit zones are processed either in an accelerated or standard procedure, depending on the circumstances of each case. Under the standard procedure, a decision on an asylum application must be taken by the IAO within sixty days; if the accelerated procedure is applied or if an application is to be declared inadmissible, the IAO must take a decision within fifteen days. Unless refugee status was granted, the decision of the IAO can be appealed against to a court. If the initial decision was taken in the standard asylum procedure, the court has sixty days to decide the appeal; if an appeal was lodged against a decision taken in the accelerated procedure, or in the event that the asylum application was rejected as inadmissible, the court decision must be taken within eight days.\n26: The relevant provisions of Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection (recast) (“the Asylum Procedures Directive”) are outlined in the case of Ilias and Ahmed (cited above, §§ 47-55).\n27: The relevant provisions of Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 laying down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection (recast) (“the Reception Conditions Directive”) provide as follows:\n28: In its judgment of 14 May 2020 in the case of FMS and Others v. Országos Idegenrendészeti Főigazgatóság Dél-alföldi Regionális Igazgatóság and Országos Idegenrendészeti Főigazgatóság (C-924/19 PPU and C-925/19 PPU) the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled inter alia that the conditions, in which asylum-seekers that had arrived in Hungary via Serbia had been kept in the Röszke transit zone, amounted to a deprivation of liberty:\n29: Article 22 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 (ratified by Hungary on 7 October 1991) reads as follows:\n30: The Report to the Hungarian Government on the visit to Hungary carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (“CPT”) from 20 to 26 October 2017 contains the following passages:\n31: The report on the fact-finding mission of June 2017 of the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on migration and refugees, Ambassador Tomáš Boček, concerning the Rӧszke transit zone (SG/Inf(2017)33) is summarised in the judgment of Ilias and Ahmed (cited above, § 67). As regards the conditions in the zone, the following observations are also relevant:\n32: The Court notes that at the time when notice of the application was given to the Government, the “Subject matter of the case” provided as follows:\n33: In their observations, the Government raised this issue and argued that, although the application had been lodged by five applicants, only the first applicant’s complaints had been communicated to them. They therefore focused their observations on his case and covered the situation of the family only to the extent that it was relevant to his complaints. The applicants, in their reply, maintained that all five of them were the applicants in the present case, which was clear from the “Subject matter of the case”, as well as from the application form and the authority forms which they had forwarded to the Court in August 2017.\n34: The Court notes that when the applicants lodged their application with the Court, they submitted a single application form with the first page of the form filled in only with respect to the first applicant. By contrast, in other parts of the application form, continuous reference was made to “applicants” in the plural, including each family member’s dates and places of birth and facts/complaints relevant to each of them. Furthermore, the “Subject matter of the case”, which was forwarded to the parties together with the above-mentioned questions and the application form, referred to the application as concerning “the confinement ... of an Iranian-Afghan family”. The Court also notes that the two Rule 39 requests submitted in the present case and the corresponding decisions indicating interim measures to the Government (see paragraphs 102 and 104 below) were made in respect of the whole family (five applicants).\n35: While the Court regrets the clerical error on its part as regards the formulation of the questions to the parties, it considers that all the references to the applicants as a family of five in documents forwarded to the Government (see paragraph 34 above) made it sufficiently evident that the application was lodged by all five applicants and that it was communicated to the parties as such.\n36: The applicants complained that the conditions of their confinement in the Röszke transit zone had been incompatible with the guarantees of Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n37: The Government argued that any discomfort allegedly suffered by the applicants in the transit zone did not attain the minimum level of severity prompting the applicability of Article 3 of the Convention. As regards the first applicant, they submitted that he had not been entitled to material conditions and that the arrangements in place in the transit zone had satisfied his basic needs. They invited the Court to declare this complaint inadmissible as incompatible ratione materiae with the Convention provisions or as manifestly ill-founded.\n38: The applicants maintained that the reception conditions in the transit zone had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.\n39: The Court considers that the applicants’ complaint under Article 3 of the Convention concerning their living conditions in the transit zone raises complex issues of law and fact, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits.\n40: It follows that this part of the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. Nor is it inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n41: In the applicants’ view, the substandard conditions of detention in the transit zone (as described in paragraphs 10-20 above) – given their specific circumstances as an asylum-seeking family with three minor children and a pregnant woman with serious health issues undergoing a protracted period of detention without a time-limit – had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. They relied on the Court’s case-law regarding administrative detention of migrant children, emphasising children’s extreme vulnerability and their specific needs related to their age, lack of independence and status.\n42: As regards the first applicant, they further submitted that he had been denied reception conditions automatically, without a duly reasoned decision being delivered by the IAO or judicial remedies, in violation of the Reception Conditions Directive (see paragraph 27 above). He had been wholly dependent on the support of the State, which had therefore had an obligation to provide for basic needs, including food, and should not have placed the burden on him or the charities, leaving him totally deprived of food during his stay in the transit zone. He had been forced to take food from his family, beg others or search for leftovers in dustbins in order to survive, while the authorities had remained indifferent and had, moreover, failed to comply with the Court’s interim measure (see paragraph 104 below).\n43: The Government submitted that asylum-seekers in the transit zones were able to have their most basic needs met, in terms of food, hygiene and shelter, and that nobody was left in a state of the most extreme poverty or a situation of serious deprivation or want. The applicants had only been accommodated in the transit zone for a short period of time, while the authorities had acted with appropriate speed and due diligence, deciding whether the applicants should be granted leave to enter Hungary.\n44: Moreover, they submitted that the applicants’ vulnerable status had not called for any special treatment which could not be provided to them in the transit zone: material reception conditions were properly adapted to pregnant women and families with minor children. In particular, the applicant mother had been provided with adequate medical care, including prenatal medical care, of a quality at least equal to that available to Hungarian nationals within the Hungarian healthcare system. The children had been generally of good health and had been able to access (specialist) medical services whenever required. Even if the whole range of social services aimed at long-term integration, such as formal schooling for children, had not been fully provided, in their opinion this should not be deemed contrary to the standards of humane treatment.\n45: As regards the first applicant, the Government maintained that the asylum authorities had been processing his third asylum application and that he had not been entitled to receive material reception conditions (see paragraph 27 above). Regardless of that fact, he had been assigned accommodation in the transit zone together with his family. Although he had not been provided with free food, he had not been left starving. His family members had been distributed a sufficient amount of long-life food which they could share with him. He could buy food with the assistance of social workers, which he had allegedly done several times. Moreover, charity organisations in the zone had regularly distributed food, which the applicant had refused to accept several times, stating that the family had sufficient supplies. He had also gone on hunger strike, so the resulting starvation and weight loss were not attributable to the Hungarian authorities.\n46: The UNHCR addressed the domestic legislative framework and practice applicable to the treatment of asylum-seekers with specific needs held in the transit zone in Hungary and provided an interpretation of the relevant principles regarding the reception of asylum-seekers. It noted that asylum-seekers in the zone did not receive psychological and psychiatric treatment by qualified practitioners. At the relevant time, no maternity nurse had visited the transit zone, although this service was now provided in the zone.\n47: The UNHCR submitted that subsequent/repeat asylum applicants held in the transit zone were allowed to receive food assistance in the form of cold food items (without fruits and vegetables) from authorised charity organisations, although such assistance was not delivered at all times or in every case.\n48: According to the Court’s well-established case-law, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of that level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, principally the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. With regard to the confinement and living conditions of asylum-seekers, the Court summarised the relevant general principles in the case of Khlaifia and Others v. Italy ([GC], no. 16483/12, §§ 158-69, 15 December 2016), and there is no need to repeat them here.\n49: It should, however, be noted that the confinement of minors raises particular issues in that regard, since children, whether accompanied or not, are considered extremely vulnerable and have specific needs related in particular to their age and lack of independence, but also to their asylumseeker status (see Popov v. France, nos. 39472/07 and 39474/07, § 91, 19 January 2012). Article 22 § 1 of the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (1577 UNTS 3) encourages States to take appropriate measures to ensure that children seeking refugee status, whether or not accompanied by their parents or others, receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance (ibid). Likewise, the European Union directives regulating the detention of migrants adopt the position that minors, whether or not they are accompanied, constitute a vulnerable category requiring the special attention of the authorities (see paragraph 27 above). In recent years, the Court has in several cases examined whether or not the conditions in which accompanied minors had been kept in migrant detention centres were in compliance with Article 3 (see S.F. and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 8138/16, §§ 80-83, 7 December 2017, and the cases referred to therein). It has found a violation of Article 3 in particular on account of a combination of three factors: the child’s young age, the length of the detention and the unsuitability of the premises for the accommodation of children (see A.B. and Others v. France, no. 11593/12, § 109, 12 July 2016).\n50: Finally, the Court reiterates that Article 3 cannot be interpreted as entailing any general obligation to give refugees financial assistance to enable them to maintain a certain standard of living (see Müslim v. Turkey, no. 53566/99, § 85, 26 April 2005, and M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, § 249, ECHR 2011). The Court nevertheless reiterates that State responsibility under Article 3 could arise for “treatment” where an applicant, in circumstances wholly dependent on State support, found him or herself faced with official indifference when in a situation of serious deprivation or want incompatible with human dignity (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, §§ 253, and Budina v. Russia (dec.), no. 45603/05, 18 June 2009).\n51: The Court has already analysed – in the case of Ilias and Ahmed ([GC], no. 47287/15, §§ 186-94, 21 November 2019) – the living conditions experienced by applicants as adult asylum-seekers in the Röszke transit zone. In that case, the Court – noting, in particular, the satisfactory material conditions in the zone, the relatively short length of the applicants’ stay there (23 days), and the possibility for human contact with other asylumseekers, UNHCR representatives, NGOs and a lawyer – concluded that the conditions in which the applicants had spent twenty-three days in the Röszke transit zone did not reach the Article 3 threshold.\n52: The Court considers that the living conditions in the transit zone, in terms of accommodation, hygiene and access to food and medical care, were generally acceptable for holding asylum-seekers for a limited period of time, as confirmed by the CPT in its 2017 Report (see paragraph 30 above). However, it finds that, unlike in the case of Ilias and Ahmed (cited above), who were both adult asylum-seekers whose basic needs were provided for by the Hungarian authorities, the applicants’ situation was characterised by the first applicant’s repeat asylum-seeker status, the applicant children’s young age and the applicant mother’s pregnancy and serious health condition (compare and contrast Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, § 192). It further notes that the applicants’ complaint as regards the living conditions experienced by them in the Röszke transit zone between 19 April and 15 August 2017 is twofold. The applicant children and the applicant mother complained that the conditions of their confinement had been inadequate in view of their vulnerabilities. The first applicant complained, in particular, that he had been deprived of food in the zone. Given the differences in the arguments advanced by the applicants, the Court finds it appropriate to examine their complaints separately.\n53: As regards the first applicant, the Court notes that, like the applicant in M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece (cited above), the applicant in the present case was at the material time an asylum-seeker (compare and contrast Hunde, cited above, § 55). It observes that the situation in which he found himself was particularly serious. Even though he had a place to live and did not report any difficulties in accessing medical care, he allegedly spent almost four months living in a state of the most extreme poverty, unable to cater for one of his most basic needs – food (compare M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 254). The case file does not disclose exactly how often and what food the first applicant could access in the Röszke transit zone. It is however undisputed that the Hungarian authorities refused to provide him with free meals throughout his stay in the zone (see paragraph 24 above).\n54: The Court observes that under the Reception Conditions Directive the authorities are in principle required to ensure that material reception conditions are provided to asylum-seekers (see paragraph 27 above). It takes note of the fact that at the relevant time the Hungarian authorities were processing the applicant’s third asylum application (see paragraph 6 above) and considered him to be a repeat asylum-seeker (see paragraphs 21 and 24 above). In this connection, the Court notes that Hungary was in principle allowed to decide to reduce or even withdraw material reception conditions from the first applicant as a repeat asylumseeker (Article 20(1)(c) of the Reception Conditions Directive, see paragraph 27 above). However, any such decision should in view of the obligations incumbent on the Hungarian authorities under the Directive have contained reasons for the withdrawal or reduction and should have taken into account the principle of proportionality (Article 20(5)). The Court was not informed of any such decision of the IAO concerning the withdrawal or reduction of material reception conditions, in particular food, in respect of the first applicant.\n55: The Court takes note of the Government’s statements that (i) his family members had been distributed sufficient amounts of long-life food which they could share with him, (ii) he had been able to buy food with the assistance of social workers in the zone, and (iii) charity organisations had taken care of his essential needs, including food (see paragraph 45 above). The first applicant challenged their arguments, submitting that he had been forced to eat other asylum-seekers’ leftovers and beg for food, while the other food arrangements mentioned by the Government had been difficult to achieve (see paragraph 42 above). The UNHCR in its third-party submissions confirmed that while repeat asylum applicants held in the transit zone were allowed to receive food assistance in the form of cold food items from certain charity organisations, such assistance was not always delivered (see paragraph 47 above). In this connection, while noting that essential needs of asylum-seekers in the transit zone may in fact be taken care of by NGOs, the Court is concerned by what seems to be a lack of any legal agreements or safeguards between the Government and the organisations allegedly supplying food assistance in the transit zone, which would ensure legal certainty of the current arrangements. Having regard to the general statements of the Government that the first applicant had had sufficient food supplies, without any information on the quality, frequency and manner in which the food had actually been provided to him, and the lack of documentation submitted in support of their arguments that the applicant had not been left starving, the Court considers that the applicant’s allegations concerning food availability in the transit zone must be regarded as sufficiently substantiated.\n56: Moreover, the Court cannot ignore the fact that the applicant could only leave the transit zone in the direction of Serbia, and would have therefore forfeited the examination of his asylum claim in Hungary (see Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, § 247). It reiterates that while at the Röszke transit zone, he was fully dependent on the Hungarian authorities for his most basic human needs and was under their control (ibid., § 186).\n57: Having regard to the above, the Court considers that the Government’s arguments (see paragraph 45 above) are unable to change the fact that the domestic authorities did not provide the first applicant with food during his four-months stay in the transit zone without duly assessing his circumstances and giving a reasoned decision in that regard. In short, they failed to have due regard to the state of dependency in which he lived there. The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that, as a result of the failings of the Hungarian authorities in securing his basic subsistence in the transit zone, the first applicant found himself for several months in a situation incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention.\n58: The Court observes at the outset that under Chapter IV of the Reception Conditions Directive, the authorities were in principle obliged to take into account the specific situation of minors and pregnant women, both categories considered vulnerable by the Directive, as well as assess and monitor any special reception needs linked to their status throughout the duration of their asylum procedures (see paragraph 27 above). Moreover, minors and pregnant women who had been found to have special needs after an individual evaluation were eligible for preferential treatment under the Asylum Act ((section 2k) of the Act, see paragraph 24 above). The Court cannot substitute its own assessment of the applicants’ condition under domestic law for that of the national authorities (see Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, § 150). It notes, however, that, in the present case, no individualised assessment of the special needs of the applicant children or the second applicant, all of whom were considered vulnerable under the European Union legislation, seems to have been carried out by the Hungarian authorities.\n59: The Court further observes that the applicant children, who were seven months, six years and seven years old respectively, were accompanied by their parents throughout their stay in the Röszke transit zone. It finds, however, that this fact is not capable of exempting the Hungarian State from its duty to protect them and take adequate measures as part of its positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention (see Muskhadzhiyeva and Others v. Belgium, no. 41442/07, §§ 57-8, 19 January 2010).\n60: As regards the physical conditions of the applicants’ stay in the transit zone, the Court observes that after their arrival on 19 April 2017, the applicants were assigned accommodation together as a family. They initially stayed in the section designated for receiving families only (see paragraph 11 above) and were later, namely on 29 June 2017, moved to the isolation section (see paragraph 13 above). The Court takes note of the fact that fans and awnings were only provided as of August 2017 (see paragraph 11 above). Even though the applicants had unrestricted access to the outdoor yard and an air-conditioned communal activity room (see paragraph 30 above), they were provided with an air-conditioned living container only in the isolation section (see paragraph 13 above). The Court is concerned by the applicants’ allegation that they were made to suffer the heat in the family section’s accommodation container and that there was no proper ventilation (see paragraph 11 above). It reiterates that suffering from heat cannot be underestimated, as such conditions may affect one’s well-being and in extreme circumstances affect health (see Aden Ahmed v. Malta, no. 55352/12, § 94, 23 July 2013). Accordingly, this is a factor which cannot be ignored in the overall assessment of the conditions in the transit zone.\n61: As regards the suitability of the facilities for children, the Court observes that the applicants’ living containers in both sections contained basic furniture and childcare equipment. However, the Government did not submit any evidence to disprove the applicants’ allegation that the beds had not been fit for use by children (see paragraph 11 above, and S.F. and Others v. Bulgaria, cited above, § 88). What is more, while the applicant children had access to facilities designated for playing and were able to participate in certain activities organised specifically for children in the family section, the situation changed once the family was moved to the isolation section – for a period of a month and a half no activities were organised and there was no playground accessible to the applicant children (see paragraph 13 above and Popov, cited above, §§ 95 and 102). The Court notes in this connection that, in the isolation section, the applicants, including the applicant children, had no contact with other asylum-seeking families or NGO representatives in the zone.\n62: As regards the provision of medical services, the Court notes that the applicant children and mother received medical (including specialist) treatment on several occasions during their stay in the transit zone (see paragraph 18 above). It does not find it established that the arrangements in place in the zone, such as the system of medical referrals to the local hospital and the transportation arrangement (see paragraph 19 above), were such as to raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention. As regards the lack of interpretation during the applicant mother’s medical examinations (see paragraph 19 above), the Court notes that the possibility for a patient to be treated by staff who speak his or her language is not an established ingredient of the right enshrined in Article 3 of the Convention (see Rooman v. Belgium [GC], no. 18052/11, § 151, 31 January 2019). It further notes that at her hospital visit of 9 August 2017 interpretation was provided at the doctor’s request. Although at her other hospital visits an anamnesis could not be collected from her due to the language constraints, the Court does not find any evidence of this language barrier limiting her effective access to treatment that was normally available. What it finds disconcerting, however, is the lack of medical documentation with respect to the youngest applicant child and the applicants’ undisputed allegation, confirmed also by the CPT report (see paragraph 30 above), that she had not been given the vaccines recommended at her age. It also accepts that outside medical treatment in the presence of (male) police officers, an allegation not disputed by the Government, must have caused a degree of discomfort to the applicants, particularly during the second applicant’s gynaecological examinations (see paragraph 19 above; see also Aden Ahmed, cited above, § 95).\n63: Of further concern to the Court is the fact that at the material time there was no professional psychological assistance available for traumatised asylum-seekers in the transit zone. It takes note of the applicants’ argument that the second applicant (the applicant mother) had had mental health problems for a long time because of trauma in Afghanistan and had been receiving help in Serbia, but had not received any psychological or psychiatric treatment in the transit zone. The Government did not explain why, in particular, the applicant mother, whose condition had been brought to the attention of the authorities, was not examined by a psychiatrist. The Court further finds, without having to rely on the medical certificate produced by the applicants (see paragraph 20 above), that the presence of elements resembling a prison environment even in the sections of the Röszke transit zone designated for families (see paragraph 30 above) and the constraints inherent during confinement, which are particularly arduous for a young child, must have caused the applicants’ children anxiety and psychological disturbance. The situation must have also created degradation of the parental image in the eyes of the children (see, mutatis mutandis, A.B. and Others v. France, § 113, and Popov, § 101, both cited above). For example, the applicants, including the applicant children, were accompanied by guards when moving between the sections even if only for the purpose of medical appointments, and armed police officers if they had to leave the zone (see paragraph 19 above). In addition, they were constantly subjected to security checks (see paragraph 14 above).\n64: Lastly, the Court takes note of the duration of the applicants’ stay; they were held for three months and twenty-seven days at the Röszke transit zone. The CPT in its report raised the issue of families with children in the transit zone, noting that the living conditions there were not adequate for holding them for prolonged periods and that their stay should be for the shortest possible period of time (see paragraph 30 above). The Court is of the view that the above-mentioned conditions, depending on the circumstances of the case, may not attain the threshold of severity required to engage Article 3, where the confinement is of a short duration. It considers that, in the case of a longer period, their repetition and accumulation would necessarily have harmful consequences for those exposed to them (compare and contrast Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, § 193). It reiterates the primary significance of the passage of time for the application of this Article (compare A.B. and Others v. France, cited above, § 114).\n65: Accordingly, in view of the applicant children’s young age, the applicant mother’s pregnancy and health situation and the length of the applicants’ stay in the transit zone in the conditions set out above, the Court finds that the situation complained of subjected the applicant children and the applicant mother to treatment which exceeded the threshold of severity required to engage Article 3 of the Convention (compare and contrast Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, § 194).\n66: The applicants alleged that there had been no effective remedy at their disposal to complain about the living conditions in the transit zone. They also claimed that the denial of reception conditions in the first applicant’s case had been automatic, without any decision being made in that regard or remedies to challenge the denial. They relied on Article 13 read in conjunction with Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n67: The Government submitted that the applicants had no arguable claim under Article 3 of the Convention and that their Article 13 complaint should therefore be declared inadmissible ratione materiae. Alternatively, they argued that this complaint was manifestly ill-founded as the applicants had had several remedies available to them in respect of the material conditions in the transit zone; they could, in particular, have lodged a complaint with the asylum authority, a request to be transferred to another pre-entry accommodation facility and a civil-law action for violation of personality rights.\n68: The Court has declared admissible the applicants’ complaint under Article 3 in respect of the conditions of detention and found a violation of that provision (see paragraphs 57 and 65 above). The complaints in question were therefore “arguable” for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, §§ 26869) and the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention must thus be declared admissible.\n69: Having found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraphs 57 and 65 and above), and in view of the fact that the alleged procedural shortcomings have been sufficiently examined under that Article (see paragraphs 54 and 58 above), the Court does not find it necessary to examine the complaint under Article 13 regarding those same alleged shortcomings.\n70: The applicants complained that they had been confined to the transit zone in violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which provide as follows:\n71: The Government emphasised that the applicants had entered the zone of their own will and had been free to leave in the direction of Serbia at any time. The restriction of their freedom of movement in the direction of Hungary pending determination of their right to enter the country had been a limitation inherent in the nature of the admission procedure. Their temporary accommodation in the transit zone had not amounted to deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention.\n72: The applicants submitted that their placement in the transit zone had amounted to a de facto deprivation of liberty for which no detention order had been issued. The fact that they had entered the transit zone of their own will did not mean that they had consented to the confinement. Had they left the zone in the direction of Serbia, this could have been used against their asylum claim and could have amounted to refoulement.\n73: The UNHCR provided, as a third-party intervener, an interpretation of the relevant principles of international and European refugee and human rights law regarding the detention of asylum-seekers.\n74: The Court reiterates the factors it has taken into consideration when determining the distinction between a restriction on liberty of movement and deprivation of liberty in the context of confinement of foreigners in transit zones and reception centres for the identification and registration of migrants: (i) the applicants’ individual situation and their choices, (ii) the applicable legal regime of the respective country and its purpose, (iii) the relevant duration, especially in the light of the purpose and the procedural protection enjoyed by applicants pending the events, and (iv) the nature and degree of the actual restrictions imposed on or experienced by the applicants (see Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, §§ 217-18, and Z.A. and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 61411/15 and 3 others, § 138, 21 November 2019). It further reiterates that in the case of Ilias and Ahmed (cited above, § 249), the Grand Chamber examined a comparable complaint and held that the applicants’ stay of twenty-three days in the Röszke transit zone did not constitute a de facto deprivation of liberty and, consequently, that Article 5 was not applicable. The Court must now examine whether the application of the factors outlined above to the applicants’ specific situation warrants a different conclusion in the present case.\n75: As regards the changes in the applicable legal regime related to the fact that the applicants could only submit an application for asylum while in the transit zone (see paragraph 24 above), the Court considers that the fact remains that the applicants entered the Röszke transit zone of their own initiative, with the aim of seeking asylum in Hungary. Having regard to the known facts about the applicants and their respective journeys, it notes in particular that they had waited in Serbia for several months before crossing the border of their own free will and not because of a direct and immediate threat to their life or health in that country. It is also clear that, in any event, the Hungarian authorities were entitled to carry out the necessary verifications and examine their claims before deciding whether or not to admit them (see Ilias and Ahmed, §§ 222-23, and Z.A. and Others v. Russia, §§ 140-42, both cited above).\n76: The purpose of the domestic legal regime applicable to the Röszke transit zone was to put in place a waiting area while the authorities decided whether to formally admit the asylum-seekers to Hungary (see Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, § 224). The applicants remained in the transit zone essentially because they were awaiting the outcome of their asylum proceedings (see paragraph 23 above).\n77: The Court reiterates that the right of States to control the entry of foreigners into their territory necessarily implies that admission authorisation may be conditional on compliance with relevant requirements. Therefore, absent other significant factors, the situation of an individual applying for entry and waiting for a short period for the verification of his or her right to enter cannot be described as deprivation of liberty imputable to the State, since in such cases the State authorities have undertaken visàvis the individual no other steps than reacting to his or her wish to enter by carrying out the necessary verifications (see Ilias and Ahmed, § 225, and Z.A. and Others v. Russia, § 144, both cited above).\n78: The Court further reiterates that, in principle, as long as the applicant’s stay in the transit zone does not exceed significantly the time needed for the examination of an asylum request and there are no exceptional circumstances, the duration in itself should not affect the Court’s analysis on the applicability of Article 5 in a decisive manner. That is particularly so where the individuals, while waiting for the processing of their asylum claims, benefitted from procedural rights and safeguards against excessive waiting periods. The presence of domestic legal regulation limiting the length of stay in the transit zone is of significant importance in this regard (see Ilias and Ahmed, § 227, and Z.A. and Others v. Russia, § 147, both cited above).\n79: The Court observes that unlike the situation in the case of Ilias and Ahmed (cited above, § 226), the provision limiting the maximum duration of an asylum-seeker’s stay in the transit zone to four weeks did not apply in the present case (see paragraph 24 above) and that the Government were unable to point to any other domestic provision fixing the maximum duration of the applicants’ stay in the transit zone. The Court notes, moreover, that the time-limits for processing asylum claims laid down in the asylum procedure (sixty days for the IAO to take a decision on an asylum application) were not respected in the present case (see paragraph 25 above).\n80: Furthermore, the Court observes that the processing of the applicants’ asylum claims was anything but speedy, as the applicants spent almost four months in the transit zone awaiting the outcome of their asylum proceedings (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above, and compare and contrast Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, § 228). It takes note, in particular, of the delays of more than two months related to the provision of an expert opinion on the first and second applicants’ marriage certificate and the DNA testing, which was only ordered two months after the applicants had been placed in the transit zone (see paragraph 22 above). Against this background, even though the IAO was entitled to take measures aimed at verifying the existence of family ties between the applicants, the Court cannot accept that the applicants’ situation was not influenced by any inaction or lack of diligence on the part of the Hungarian authorities. The Court would add that the case file contains no indication that the applicants themselves, who were last interviewed on 8 June 2017, failed to comply with the legal regulations in place or did not act in good faith at any time during their stay in the transit zone by, for instance, complicating the examination of their asylum cases (see Z.A. and Others v. Russia, cited above, § 149).\n81: While the applicants were not permitted to leave the Röszke transit zone in the direction of the remaining territory of Hungary, they could have left the transit zone in the direction of Serbia at any time (see paragraph 24 above). In this connection, the Court reiterates that the risk of the applicants’ forfeiting the examination of their asylum claims in Hungary and their fears about insufficient access to asylum procedures in Serbia (see paragraph 72 above) did not render the possibility of them leaving the transit zone in the direction of Serbia merely theoretical. Therefore, it did not have the effect of making the applicants’ stay in the transit zone involuntary from the standpoint of Article 5 and, consequently, could not have triggered, of itself, the applicability of that provision (see Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, § 248).\n82: As regards the conditions in which the applicants lived in the transit zone, the Court observes that, overall, as in the case of Ilias and Ahmed (cited above, § 232), the size of the applicants’ section in the transit zone and the manner in which it was controlled were such that the applicants’ freedom of movement was severely restricted, in a manner similar to that characteristic of a certain type of light-regime detention facility. In this connection, the Court cannot ignore the fact that the applicants spent a month and a half in the isolation section of the transit zone, under conditions which were, due to its nature, even more restrictive (see paragraph 13 above). The Court also refers to its finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention with respect to these conditions (see paragraphs 57 and 65 above).\n83: Having regard to the above considerations, in particular to the lack of any domestic legal provisions fixing the maximum duration of the applicants’ stay, the excessive duration of that stay and the considerable delays in the domestic examination of the applicants’ asylum claims, as well as the conditions in which the applicants were held during the relevant period, the Court finds that, in the circumstances of the present case, the applicants’ stay in the transit zone amounted to a de facto deprivation of liberty (compare and contrast Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, § 249). Article 5 § 1 is therefore applicable.\n84: It follows that this part of the application is not incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention. Moreover, it is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of the same provision. Nor is it inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n85: The applicants alleged that the impugned measure had lacked any basis in domestic law and that there had been no decision on deprivation of liberty issued in their case. They further submitted that Hungary, a Member State of the European Union, was under an obligation to act in accordance with Article 8 of Reception Conditions Directive (see paragraph 27 above) according to which Member States should not hold a person in detention for the sole reason that he or she was an asylum-seeker. The applicants stressed that detention should be subject to individual assessment and had to be necessary and proportionate. The IAO’s ruling on their placement in the transit zone had lacked any assessment of the best interests of the children and had not verified whether any non-coercive alternatives to detention could be applied.\n86: The Government submitted that, even if Article 5 of the Convention was applicable to the case, the deprivation of liberty had had legal basis in Hungarian law and had been justified under the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (f). In this connection, they relied on section 80/J of the Asylum Act (see paragraph 24 above), which provided that asylum-seekers were not entitled to a right of entry and stay in the territory of Hungary and that pending determination of their asylum applications they were accommodated in a transit zone. Pending asylum proceedings were therefore the sole condition for the lawfulness of detention in the transit zone, not requiring any judicial assessment or judicial review.\n87: The Court refers to the general principles on Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention as summarised in the case of Z.A. and Others v. Russia (cited above, §§ 159-63). It reiterates that any deprivation of liberty must be “in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law” that meets the “quality of law” criteria, as well as be free from arbitrariness. Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is essential that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied and therefore that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, § 92, with further references). Furthermore, the detention of a person constitutes a major interference with individual freedom and must always be subject to rigorous scrutiny (see, Z.A. and Others v. Russia, cited above, § 161).\n88: The Court is fully conscious of the difficulties that member States may face during periods of massive arrivals of asylum-seekers at their borders. Subject to the prohibition of arbitrariness, the lawfulness requirement of that provision may be considered generally satisfied by a domestic legal regime that provides, for example, for no more than the name of the authority competent to order deprivation of liberty in a transit zone, the form of the order, its possible grounds and limits, the maximum duration of the confinement and, as required by Article 5 § 4, the applicable avenue of judicial appeal (ibid, § 162).\n89: Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the applicants’ detention in the transit zone lasted from 19 April to 15 August 2017, that is, three months and twenty-seven days. According to the Government, section 80/J of the Asylum Act provided the legal basis for the measure (see paragraph 24 above). This provision states that asylum applications can only be submitted, with certain exceptions, in the transit zone, and that asylum seekers are required to wait in there until a final decision is taken on their asylum applications. The Court, for its part, cannot identify in the provision in question any reference to the possibility of detention in the transit zone nor any indication of the maximum duration of asylum seekers’ detention in the zone. Accordingly, it concludes that in the present case there was no strictly defined statutory basis for the applicants’ detention (see, mutatis mutandis, Z.A. and Others v. Russia, cited above, § 164).\n90: The Court further notes that the applicants’ detention occurred de facto, that is, as a matter of practical arrangement. The Hungarian authorities did not issue any formal decision of legal relevance complete with reasons for the detention, including an individual assessment and consideration of any alternative measures that would have been less coercive than detention for the applicant family (see, mutatis mutandis, A.B. and Others v. France, cited above, §§ 123-24; see also Article 8 of the Reception Conditions Directive in paragraph 27 above).\n91: The motives underlying the applicants’ detention may well be those referred to by the Government in the context of Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention. However, the fact remains that the applicants were deprived of their liberty without any formal decision of the authorities and solely by virtue of an overly broad interpretation of a general provision of the law – a procedure which in the Court’s view falls short of the requirements enounced in its case-law.\n92: It follows that the applicants’ detention cannot be considered “lawful” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. There has accordingly been a violation of that provision.\n93: The applicants further complained that the deprivation of their liberty in the transit zone could not be remedied by appropriate judicial review, in breach of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, which provides:\n94: The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n95: The applicants submitted that because they had not received a formal decision on their detention, they could not challenge the lawfulness of the measure in any kind of procedure and could not request their release before a judicial body.\n96: The Government submitted that there was an effective judicial remedy against the unlawful silence of the asylum authority and arbitrariness of “pre-entry detention” of asylum-seekers in the transit zone under section 20 of the Administrative Procedure Act (see Lokpo and Touré v. Hungary, no. 10816/10, § 13, 20 September 2011).\n97: The Court reiterates its above finding that the applicants’ detention consisted of a de facto measure, not supported by any decision specifically addressing the issue of deprivation of liberty (see paragraph 90 above). Moreover, the administrative remedy suggested by the Government concerned the applicants’ asylum applications rather than the question of personal liberty. In these circumstances, the Court does not find it established that the applicants could have sought a judicial review of their detention in the transit zone – which itself had not taken the form of a formal decision.\n98: The Court must therefore conclude that the applicants did not have at their disposal any proceedings by which the lawfulness of their detention could have been decided speedily by a court.\n99: It follows that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention.\n100: The applicants alleged under Article 34 of the Convention that the authorities had failed to comply with the interim measure indicated by the Court on 19 May 2017. The relevant provision reads as follows:\n101: The Court refers at the outset to the principles set out in its caselaw regarding the obligations laid down in Article 34 of the Convention and their relationship to the interim measures provided for by Rule 39 (see, for instance, Paladi v. Moldova [GC], no. 39806/05, §§ 84-92, 10 March 2009). According to those principles, the starting-point for verifying whether a respondent State has complied with an interim measure is the formulation of the interim measure itself (ibid., § 91).\n102: Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that on 19 May 2017 it decided to apply a first measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court in the case, indicating to the Hungarian Government:\n103: By a letter of 30 May 2017 the applicants informed the Court that they were still detained in the transit zone despite the interim measure. They drew the Court’s attention to an unanswered letter sent to the IAO by their legal representative requesting their release. In their letter of 7 June 2017 the Government did not dispute their obligation under Article 34 of the Convention to comply with the interim measure. Instead, they contended that the Court’s interim measure did not require the applicants’ transfer to another reception centre and that it could be complied with within the transit zone. They submitted that the conditions in the zone, where they provided adequate accommodation and care for the applicants and their specific needs, satisfied the requirements of Article 3. In the application form, in which the applicants raised the Article 34 complaint, they maintained that after the Court’s Rule 39 decision of 19 May 2017 the conditions of their placement in the transit zone had not improved and, in some ways, had even worsened.\n104: The Court notes that on 7 July 2017 the Court decided to apply a second interim measure in the case, reiterating the first Rule 39 measure and, additionally, indicating that the Hungarian Government should “ensure regular meals also for the first applicant and interpretation for the second applicant during her medical check-ups”.\n105: In so far as the applicants can be understood as stating that only placement in an open reception centre would have complied with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 103 above), the Court observes that the Rule 39 decision of 19 May 2017 did not refer to a specific facility for the applicants’ accommodation or request that the Government place the applicants in a reception centre outside the transit zone (see paragraph 101 above). It notes that the applicants’ allegation that the conditions in the transit zone worsened following the interim measure of 19 May 2017 (see paragraph 103 above) remained largely unsubstantiated.\n106: The Court further notes that the applicants’ complaint under Article 34 of the Convention concerns, in effect, the respondent State’s obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. The question whether the Government in fact complied with the interim measure at issue is thus closely related to the examination of the complaints raised by the applicants under the latter Convention provision.\n107: Given the nature of the interim measures applied in the present case, the parties’ submissions and the Court’s findings concerning the applicants’ complaint under Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraphs 57 and 65 above) – the Court takes the view that it has examined the main legal question raised in respect of their situation in the transit zone and that it does not need to give a separate ruling on the complaint under Article 34 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kamil Uzun v. Turkey, no. 37410/97, § 64, 10 May 2007).\n108: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n109: The applicants claimed 15,000 euros (EUR) each in respect of nonpecuniary damage.\n110: The Government argued that the claim was excessive.\n111: Having regard to the circumstances of the present case and the nature of the violations found, the Court considers it reasonable to award each of the adult applicants (the first and second applicants) the amount of EUR 4,500 and each of the applicant children the amount of EUR 6,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n112: With respect to the proceedings before the Court, the applicants claimed EUR 18,070 for 121 hours of legal work at the hourly rate of EUR 150 plus EUR 80 in clerical expenses. The lawyer indicated that she had agreed with the applicants that the latter would pay her if they won the case before the Court.\n113: The Government submitted that the expenses claimed had not been necessarily incurred and were not reasonable as to quantum, given the number of irrelevant submissions made by the applicants and their similarity to the submissions made in other cases.\n114: According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 5,000 for the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants.\n115: The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points."

Whereas the applicant’s husband had decided, in a will drawn up in accordance with civil law before a notary, to bequeath his whole estate to her, the Court of Cassation considered that the Islamic law of succession should be applied to her case. This had the consequence of depriving the applicant of her rights under the will made by her husband, which was rendered without any legal effect. The Court has decided (see paragraph 86 above) to consider the case solely under Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In assessing this complaint the Court will first of all address the question of the applicability of Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It will then seek to establish whether the applicant, as the beneficiary of a will made in accordance with the Civil Code by a testator of Muslim faith, in this case her husband, was in an analogous or relevantly similar situation to that of a beneficiary of a will made in accordance with the Civil Code by a non-Muslim testator, and whether she was treated differently.

                "CASE OF MOLLA SALI v. GREECE; § 1: The case originated in an application (no. 20452/14) against the Hellenic Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Greek national, Mrs Chatitze Molla Sali (“the applicant”), on 5 March 2014.\n2: The applicant was represented by Mr Y. Ktistakis and Mr K. Tsitselikis, lawyers practising in Athens and Thessaloniki respectively. The Greek Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent’s Delegates, Mr K. Georghiadis and Ms V. Pelekou, Advisers at the State Legal Council, and Ms A. Magrippi, Legal Assistant at the State Legal Council.\n3: The applicant alleged a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, taken alone and in conjunction with Article 14 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, in the context of a case concerning the inheritance rights to the property of her deceased husband.\n4: The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). On 23 August 2016 the President of the Section decided, in accordance with Rule 54 § 2 (b), to give notice of the aforementioned complaints to the respondent Government. On 6 June 2017 a Chamber of that Section, composed of Kristina Pardalos, President, Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos, Ledi Bianku, Aleš Pejchal, Armen Harutyunyan, Pauline Koskelo and Tim Eicke, judges, and Renata Degener, Deputy Section Registrar, relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, neither of the parties having objected (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).\n5: The composition of the Grand Chamber was decided in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 §§ 4 and 5 of the Convention and Rule 24. Judge Pardalos, whose term of office expired in the course of the proceedings, continued to deal with the case (Article 23 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 23 § 4).\n6: The applicant and the Government each filed written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case. Christian Concern, the Hellenic League for Human Rights and Greek Helsinki Monitor, which had all been given leave to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 3), also submitted comments.\n7: A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 6 December 201\n8: The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Komotini.\n9: The applicant’s husband, Moustafa Molla Sali, a member of the Muslim community of Thrace, died on 21 March 2008. On 7 February 2003 he had drawn up a notarised public will in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Civil Code. He had bequeathed his whole estate to his wife, namely: one-third of a 2,000 sq. m plot of farmland near Komotini; one-half of a 127 sq. m apartment, a parking space and a basement in a block of flats in Komotini; one-quarter of a shop in Komotini with a surface area of 24 sq. m, and another shop measuring 31 sq. m in Komotini, which was subsequently expropriated in return for compensation that has already been paid to the applicant; and four properties in Istanbul.\n10: By decision no. 12.785/2003 of 10 June 2008 the Komotini Court of First Instance, on the basis of a next-of-kin certificate submitted by the applicant, approved the will presented before it. On 6 April 2010 the applicant accepted her husband’s estate by notarised deed. The Treasury was notified and the applicant registered the property transferred to her with the Komotini Land Registry, paying the corresponding registration fees. It does not appear from the case file that the applicant had to pay any inheritance tax on the property transferred to her.\n11: On 12 December 2009, meanwhile, the deceased’s two sisters had challenged the validity of the will before the Rodopi Court of First Instance. They asserted a claim to three-quarters of the property bequeathed. They submitted that they and the deceased belonged to the Thrace Muslim community and that therefore any questions relating to his estate were subject to Islamic religious law (Sharia law) and the jurisdiction of the mufti, rather than to the provisions of the Civil Code. They contended that the application of Muslim customs and Sharia law to Greek nationals of Muslim faith was laid down in the provisions of Article 14 § 1 of the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres (ratified by decree of 29 September/ 30 October 1923) and Articles 42 and 45 of the Treaty of Lausanne (ratified by decree of 25 August 1923) (see paragraphs 65-68 below). They argued that the law of succession applicable to Muslims was based on intestacy rather than testacy. Under Islamic law, where the deceased was survived by close relatives, the will only served to complement the intestate succession. Those provisions had continued to apply after the adoption of the Greek Civil Code, pursuant to section 6 of the Introductory Law to the Code, solely in respect of Greek nationals of Muslim faith living in Thrace.\n12: By judgment no. 50/2010 of 1 June 2010, the Rodopi Court of First Instance dismissed the challenge brought by the deceased’s sisters. It held that applying the Islamic law of succession to Greek Muslims in such a way as to prevent them from disposing of their property in anticipation of their death gave rise to unacceptable discrimination on grounds of religious beliefs. It found that the consequent inability of such persons to draw up a public will was in breach of Article 4 (principle of equality), Article 5 § 1 (free development of personality), Article 5 § 2 (principle of non-discrimination) and Article 13 § 1 (freedom of religious conscience) of the Constitution, as well as Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The court emphasised that even if it should be inferred from section 5(2) of Law no. 1920/1991 (ratifying the Legislative Act of 24 December 1990 on Muslim ministers of religion) that inheritance matters for Muslims were governed by Sharia law, such law should be applied in a manner compatible with the Constitution and the Convention. The incompatibility in the present case had stemmed from interpreting the Islamic law of succession in such a way as to deprive the persons concerned of some of their civil rights, against their wishes. The court added that although the application of Sharia law was based, inter alia, on international law, and in particular on the combined effect of Articles 42 and 45 of the Treaty of Lausanne, it should not result in the Islamic law of succession being applied in such a way as to curtail the civil rights of Greek Muslims, because the aim of the treaty had not been to deprive the members of that minority of such rights, but to strengthen their protection.\n13: The court pointed out that a Greek Muslim contacting a notary in order to draw up a public will was exercising his right to dispose of his property, in anticipation of his death, under the same conditions as other Greek citizens. It was consequently impossible to annul the will or to override any of its legal effects on the grounds that a will of that kind was prohibited by Sharia law. Upholding the claimants’ arguments would thus amount to introducing an unacceptable difference in treatment among Greek nationals on the grounds of their religious beliefs.\n14: On 16 June 2010 the deceased’s sisters appealed against the aforementioned judgment.\n15: On 28 September 2011 the Thrace Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal (judgment no. 392/2011). It emphasised, firstly, that the legislative provisions enacted pursuant to the Treaties of Sèvres and Lausanne had been intended to protect Greek nationals of Muslim faith and were in conformity with the Constitution and the Convention. That applied both to Islamic wills and to intestate succession, and the mufti had no jurisdiction in relation to public wills. The court held that since the testator was free to choose the type of will he wished to draw up in the exercise of his rights and therefore to draw up a public will in accordance with Article 1724 of the Civil Code, he was not obliged to follow Islamic law, which did not cover matters relating to such wills. Furthermore, the mufti had no jurisdiction over the testator’s wishes, which could not be circumscribed. Otherwise, there would be discrimination on grounds of religion, which was unlawful under the general rules on prohibition of discrimination.\n16: More specifically, the Court of Appeal noted that the decision taken by the deceased, a Greek citizen of Muslim faith belonging to the Thrace Muslim religious minority, to ask a notary to draw up a public will, choosing personally to decide how and to whom he would bequeath his property, fell within his legal right to dispose of his property in anticipation of his death, under the same conditions as other Greek nationals.\n17: On 23 January 2012 the deceased’s sisters lodged an appeal on points of law.\n18: By judgment no. 1862/2013 of 7 October 2013 and on the basis of a provision of international law, namely Article 11 of the 1913 Treaty of Athens, and provisions of domestic law, namely section 4 of Law no. 147/1914, section 10 of Law no. 2345/1920 (enacted pursuant to the 1913 Treaty of Athens) and section 5(2) of Law no. 1920/1991 the Court of Cassation allowed the appeal. It noted that section 10 of Law no. 2345/1920 (on the provisional Arch-Mufti and muftis serving Muslims residing in the territory) reproduced the contents of Article 11 § 8.1 of the Treaty of Athens, pursuant to which muftis exercised their jurisdiction over Muslims in the spheres of marriage, divorce, maintenance payments, guardianship, trusteeship, capacity of minors, Islamic wills and intestate succession. It emphasised that the law governing interpersonal relations among Greek nationals of Muslim faith, as laid down in the above-mentioned treaty ratified by Greece, was, pursuant to Article 28 § 1 of the Constitution, an integral part of Greek domestic law and prevailed over any other legal provision to the contrary. Examining the reasoning of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, it concluded that that court’s determination of the case had breached the relevant legislative provisions, because the law applicable to the deceased person’s estate had been the Islamic law of succession, which formed part of domestic law and applied specifically to Greek nationals of Muslim faith. It noted that the estate in question belonged to the category of property held “in full ownership” (mulkia) – public land which had belonged to the Ottoman administration, the full ownership of which had been transferred to private individuals and which had been governed by Sharia law during the Ottoman occupation – and that, consequently, the impugned public will had to be deemed invalid and devoid of legal effect on the grounds that Sharia law recognised no such institution.\n19: The Court of Cassation remitted the case to the Thrace Court of Appeal.\n20: By judgment no. 183/2015 of 15 December 2015 the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment delivered by the Rodopi Court of First Instance on 1 June 2010. In line with the Court of Cassation’s judgment, it held that the relevant legislative provisions had been intended to protect Greek nationals of Muslim faith, constituted a special body of law and did not breach the principle of equality secured under Article 4 of the Constitution or the right of access to a court as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention. It pointed out that the law applicable to the deceased’s estate had been Sharia law, because the property bequeathed belonged to the “mulkia” category, and that consequently the public will at issue was devoid of legal effect because Sharia law did not recognise any such institution. It emphasised that the judgments of the Court of Cassation were binding on the courts to which cases were remitted as regards the legal issues determined by those judgments. It therefore considered itself bound by the Court of Cassation’s judgment of 7 October 2013 and could not overrule it, thus being unable to allow a request by the applicant to seek a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning the interpretation of section 5(2) of Law no. 1920/1991 and of Article 45 of the Treaty of Lausanne. Since an appeal on points of law was lodged against that judgment, it was not immediately enforceable.\n21: On 8 February 2016 the applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and the hearing in the Court of Cassation was scheduled for 11 January 2017. She put forward a number of grounds of appeal.\n22: In her first ground of appeal she submitted that the impugned judgment had been insufficiently reasoned as regards one specific point which she considered to have had a decisive influence on the outcome of the proceedings, namely that it had ignored the question whether her husband had been a “practising Muslim”, which was a precondition for the application of the special body of law.\n23: The applicant’s second ground of appeal was that section 5(2) of Law no. 1920/1991 and certain Articles of the Civil Code had been incorrectly interpreted and applied. She submitted that the impugned judgment had extended the scope of the provisions creating a separate body of law for Greek nationals of Muslim faith to members of the Muslim community who did not faithfully adhere to Islamic doctrine.\n24: The applicant argued in conclusion that those grounds of appeal had not been encompassed in the legal issue determined by judgment no. 1862/2013 of the Court of Cassation. She pointed out that that judgment had concerned Greek nationals of Muslim faith in general and had not addressed the matter of the law applicable to non-practising members of the Muslim community.\n25: In her additional observations, the applicant contended that the case, which concerned the drawing up of a public will, a possibility afforded to all Greek citizens regardless of religious considerations, fell outside the mufti’s jurisdiction. The specific provisions concerning the Muslim minority could not, in her submission, be applied without violating the individual rights of Muslims as guaranteed under the Greek Constitution, as well as by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n26: By judgment no. 556/2017 of 6 April 2017 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law. It did not refer to the Convention in its reasoning.\n27: As regards the applicant’s first ground of appeal, it declared it inadmissible, finding that it was based on the extent of the deceased’s religious sentiment as a Muslim, a criterion that had no legal effect. It added that the deceased’s Greek nationality did not preclude the application of Sharia law.\n28: As regards the second ground of appeal, the Court of Cassation held that the Court of Appeal’s judgment had contained sound reasons, in line with the Court of Cassation’s judgment no. 1862/2013. It emphasised that the Court of Appeal had assessed the facts of the case in the light of substantive law and had given sufficient reasons for its determination of the fundamental issue of recognising the invalidity of the will.\n29: That judgment marked the end of the proceedings in respect of the property located in Greece.\n30: As a result of the whole proceedings, the applicant was deprived of three-quarters of the property bequeathed.\n31: In 2011, meanwhile, the testator’s sisters had applied to the Istanbul Civil Court of First Instance for the annulment of the will, in accordance with the principles of private international law enshrined in the Turkish Civil Code. They submitted that the will was contrary to Turkish public policy. Hearings were held on 9 February and 26 May 2016, but the court adjourned its consideration of the case on the grounds that the applicant still had to appeal on points of law against judgment no. 183/2015 of the Thrace Court of Appeal. The new hearing in the case was scheduled for 28 September 2017, and then adjourned until 18 January 2018. By the date of the present judgment the Court had yet to be informed of the progress of those proceedings.\n32: The relevant Articles of the Constitution provide:\n33: The relevant Articles of the Civil Code provide as follows:\n34: Article 562 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows:\n35: Under the Islamic law of succession (Farâ’idh), intestate succession is the most common form of inheritance. Death results in the permanent cessation of legal relations between the deceased and third parties. Such third parties include the deceased’s heirs, who are treated as creditors. Any creditors other than the heirs are accorded a higher rank and must be prioritised, failing which any inheritance in favour of the heirs is null and void.\n36: Male heirs have double the share in the estate as compared with female heirs. They are treated as “autonomous” heirs and are entitled to the portion of the estate remaining after those entitled to fractional shares have received them. The widow and daughters of the deceased are deemed to be entitled to fractional shares in the estate. Six types of fractional shares are possible: one-half, one-quarter, one-eighth, one-third, two-thirds and one-sixth. Thus, the widow will receive one-eighth of the estate, if there are any children, and one-quarter if there are none. If the deceased’s only child is female, she is entitled to half of the estate. If the deceased also has brothers and a mother, his daughter will receive one-sixth.\n37: By judgment no. 152/1991, the Rodopi Court of First Instance ruled that the system of unequal shares in an estate under the intestate mode of succession was contrary to Article 4 § 2 of the Constitution, which guarantees gender equality.\n38: Sharia law also provides for an Islamic will, although this is more akin to a legacy. Such a will is drawn up by the mufti himself or is made orally before two witnesses. It enables the person concerned to bequeath up to one-third of his property to third parties (other than his heirs) for charitable purposes.\n39: A mufti is a Greek civil servant holding the rank of Director-General of Administration who is appointed by presidential decree on a proposal by the Minister of Education and Religious Affairs (regarding the role of the mufti, see also paragraphs 50 and 77 below).\n40: The protection of the religious specificity of Greek Muslims is based on a series of international instruments (see paragraphs 62-65 below), as well as on section 4 of Law no. 147/1914 of 5 January 1914 on legislation applicable in the ceded territories and their judicial organisation (enacted pursuant to the Treaty of Athens, to which section 4(2) of the Law refers), which provides:\n41: When the Greek Civil Code was adopted in 1946, section 6 of the Introductory Law to the Code repealed section 4 of Law no. 147/1914 in respect of Greek nationals of Jewish faith only. However, section 8 of the Introductory Law to the Code maintained section 10(1) of Law no. 2345/1920, which was later superseded by section 5(2) of Law no. 1920/1991 (see paragraph 45 below).\n42: Section 5(2) of Law no. 1920/1991 ratifying the Legislative Act of 24 December 1990 on Muslim ministers of religion provides:\n43: Section 5(3) of the same Law provides as follows:\n44: The highest Greek courts disagree as to whether the Treaty of Athens is still in force and as to its scope. The Supreme Administrative Court has ruled that the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne on protecting minorities are based on the principle of equal treatment of members of minorities and other citizens in the exercise of their civil and political rights. Consequently, in its view, Article 11 of the Treaty of Athens is not compatible with the aforementioned principle and is therefore no longer applicable (judgments nos. 1333/2001 and 466/2003). On the other hand, according to the settled case-law of the civil bench of the Court of Cassation, the Treaty of Athens is the legal basis for the protection of minorities in Greece, and the international obligation to apply Sharia law flows from that treaty (judgments nos. 231/1932, 105/1937, 14/1938, 322/1960, 738/1967, 1723/1980, 1041/2000, 1097/2007 and 2113/2009).\n45: The civil bench of the Court of Cassation has also held that the status granted to Greek Muslims under the Treaties of Sèvres and Lausanne did not lapse as a result of the adoption of the Civil Code in 1946 (see paragraph 41 above). It has noted that only the part of section 4 of Law no. 147/1914 concerning the Jewish community, and not that regarding the Muslim community, was repealed. It has also found that although Law no. 1920/1991 repealed section 10(1) of Law no. 2345/1920 (see paragraph 41 above), it incorporated the contents of that provision into its own section 5(2). The Court of Cassation has emphasised that the aforementioned legislative provisions, which had been introduced pursuant to the Treaties of Sèvres and Lausanne, were intended to protect Greek Muslims, amounted to a special law applicable to interpersonal relations and were not contrary to Article 4 § 1 of the Constitution (principle of equality), Article 20 § 1 of the Constitution (right to judicial protection), or Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, for example, judgment no. 2138/2013 of the Court of Cassation of 5 December 2013).\n46: The Civil bench of the Court of Cassation has accepted that Sharia law applies subject to its compatibility with the Constitution and with international law, a question that has to be decided by the domestic courts when assessing the enforceability of decisions given by the mufti. In its aforementioned judgment no. 2138/2013 it held:\n47: On the other hand, the criminal bench of the Court of Cassation has held that section 5(2) of Law no. 1920/1991 is a procedural provision which cannot create any substantive legal rule (judgment no. 1588/2011). It has ruled that the question of maintenance payments to a Muslim’s wife and children should be settled by the civil courts and not by the mufti.\n48: Studying the case-law of the courts of first instance on this subject, legal commentators have noted that those courts do not in fact perform a proper review of constitutionality, but in most cases formally ratify the mufti’s decision. Between 2007 and 2014, for example, the Xanthi and Rodopi courts declared enforceable 390 decisions by the Mufti of Xanthi and 476 decisions by the Mufti of Komotini respectively, and refused to do so in 34 and 17 cases respectively.\n49: In an opinion issued on 3 November 1953 the plenary State Legal Council held that section 4 of Law no. 147/1914 – in so far as it related to the law of succession applicable to Greek Muslims – and a number of other provisions were no longer based on the international treaties in force on the date of adoption of the Civil Code and should therefore be deemed to have lapsed. The State Legal Council held that Article 11 of the Treaty of Athens had been tacitly abrogated by the subsequent Treaties of Sèvres and Lausanne. It added that the repeal of section 4 of Law no. 147/1914 and of certain provisions of other laws (governing matters pertaining to respect for the customs of the Muslim minority) as a result of the adoption of the Civil Code, which was applicable to all Greek nationals and all family-law matters, should not be considered contrary to the Treaty of Lausanne. Lastly, it noted that Turkey’s repeal of the provisions applicable to its own minorities and Greece’s acceptance of that situation supported the conclusion that the entry into force of a single Civil Code compatible with prevailing conceptions in western European civilisation was not in breach of the Treaty of Lausanne. Accordingly, when imposing inheritance tax, the tax authorities should take the view that Greek Muslims inherited in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code.\n50: It also appears from the case-law of the Greek lower courts that the jurisdiction of the mufti and the application of Sharia law are limited by the constitutional and international obligations in force in the national legal system, requiring the State, in the event of a conflict between that law and civil rights, to secure the latter to Muslim Greek citizens by applying the Greek Civil Code (judgment no. 9/2008 of the Rodopi Court of First Instance).\n51: By judgment no. 7/2001 the Thrace Court of Appeal ruled that matters of family law and inheritance law falling within the mufti’s jurisdiction were strictly defined and circumscribed because they had given rise to an exceptional body of law an extensive interpretation of which could not be tolerated.\n52: By decision no. 1623/2003 ordering interim measures, the Xanthi Court of First Instance held that where Greek nationals of Muslim faith opted to contract a civil marriage, all matters coming under family law, including those listed in section 5(2), were governed not by Sharia law but by the rules of ordinary law and fell under the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. The Xanthi Court of First Instance also ruled that freedom of religion and the principle of equality afford all Greek citizens the right to choose whatever type of marriage they wish and, if they opt for civil marriage, the right to have the corresponding law applied to their situation.\n53: By judgment no. 102/2012, the Xanthi Court of First Instance also ruled that the deprivation of the rights of Greek Muslim women or their unequal treatment could not be found to be justified by special circumstances or necessary on public-interest grounds overriding fundamental rights, gender equality and equality before the law. However, that judgment was overturned by the Thrace Court of Appeal (judgment no. 178/2015).\n54: Moreover, in the instant case (see paragraph 15 above), the Thrace Court of Appeal has ruled that the mufti has no jurisdiction regarding inheritance by public will, and that the deceased’s wishes cannot be restricted by the mufti’s jurisdiction, as that would amount to discrimination on grounds of religion. It has also noted that Sharia law is a special body of law whose interpretation has the effect of depriving Muslims of their rights against their wishes (judgment no. 392/2011).\n55: Since 1960, the established case-law of the civil bench of the Court of Cassation, for its part, has tended to apply Sharia law to intestate succession concerning property held “in full ownership” (judgments nos. 321/1960, 1041/2000, 1097/2007, 2113/2009, 1497/2013 and 1370/2014). By judgment no. 1097/2007 of 16 May 2007, the Court of Cassation held that the estate of Greek Muslims concerning unencumbered property was strictly governed by “Islamic holy law” and not by the Civil Code. Furthermore, on 7 February 2017 it reiterated that Sharia law was the only law applicable to Greek Muslims in the sphere of intestate succession.\n56: In a “written contribution” on the implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in Greece, submitted in July 2016 to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the National Commission for Human Rights pointed out that the authorities were continuing not to apply Greek civil law relating to marriage and inheritance to the Thrace Muslim minority, and that the application of Sharia law was incompatible with the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It expressed its concern as regards the Court of Cassation’s judgment no. 1862/2013 in the present case (see paragraph 18 above), which it said had set a precedent liable to affect judicial practice in Greece and breached the right of members of the Thrace Muslim minority to make a will in accordance with civil law, a right which they had been able to exercise since 1946 (Annual Report of the National Commission for Human Rights, 2016, p. 239).\n57: The relevant provisions of Law no. 4511/2018, which came into force on 15 January 2018, read as follows:\n58: The explanatory report on Law no. 4511/2018 pointed out that case-law and legal opinion had dealt with various aspects of the application of Sharia law and the issue of the hierarchy of certain provisions and their ranking in the domestic legal order, as well as their conformity with the Constitution and European human rights standards. This issue is still relevant, bearing in mind the developments in legal opinion and case-law on such matters and the interaction between the case-law of the Greek courts and that of the international courts.\n59: The report acknowledged that the State had not acted on this matter for ninety-seven years, during which time conceptions, practices and traditions had evolved at both international and national levels.\n60: The report pointed out that the State should not be a mere onlooker during a legal debate and should no longer leave it to the judiciary to resolve important issues that affected Greek citizens.\n61: By the date of adoption of the present judgment the decree mentioned in section 1(4)(b) of the Law had apparently not yet been issued.\n62: The protection of the religious distinctiveness of Greek Muslims is based on three international treaties: the Treaty of Athens of 14 November 1913, which was intended to strengthen peace and friendship between Greece and Turkey, the Treaty of Sèvres of 10 August 1920 concerning the protection of minorities (concluded between, on the one hand, Greece, and on the other, the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan), and the Lausanne Peace Treaty of 24 July 1923 (concluded between, on the one hand, the British Empire, France, Italy, Japan, Greece, Romania and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State and, on the other, Turkey).\n63: Article 11 of the Treaty of Athens provides:\n64: Article 14 § 1 of the Treaty of Sèvres provided as follows:\n65: The Treaty of Lausanne provides, in particular:\n66: Article 30 (application of successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 provides:\n67: Article 3 § 1 of this Convention, which was adopted in 1995 and came into force on 1 February 1998 (and has been signed but not ratified by Greece), provides:\n68: The explanatory report on the Framework Convention emphasises that Article 3 § 1 “firstly guarantees to every person belonging to a national minority the freedom to choose to be treated or not to be treated as such. This provision leaves it to every such person to decide whether or not he or she wishes to come under the protection flowing from the principles of the framework Convention” (§ 34). The report specifies that that paragraph “does not imply a right for an individual to choose arbitrarily to belong to any national minority. The individual’s subjective choice is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to the person’s identity” (§ 35). It adds that paragraph 1 “further provides that no disadvantage shall arise from the free choice it guarantees, or from the exercise of the rights which are connected to that choice [and that t]his ... provision aims to secure that the enjoyment of the freedom to choose shall also not be impaired indirectly” (§ 36).\n69: In its 2018 General comment No. 6 on equality and non-discrimination, adopted on 26 April 2018, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities reaffirmed its view that the concept of “discrimination” includes discrimination against:\n70: In its concluding comments of 2 February 2007 on Greece the Committee voiced its concern about the non-application of Greek legislation on marriage and inheritance to the Muslim minority, fearing that that situation amounted to discrimination against Muslim women in breach of the Greek Constitution and Article 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.\n71: In its concluding observations on the seventh periodic report by Greece, adopted at its fifty-fourth session (11 February – 1 March 2013), the Committee noted the following:\n72: In a document of 25 April 2005 entitled “Consideration of reports submitted by States Parties under Article 40 of the Covenant”, the Human Rights Committee noted the following as regards Greece:\n73: In a subsequent follow-up document dated 23 January 2014, the Human Rights Committee reproduced the Greek Government’s reply, as follows:\n74: Commissioner Thomas Hammarberg and his delegation visited Greece, including the Evros region, from 8 to 10 December 2008. In the course of this visit the Commissioner held discussions with State authorities and non-governmental, national and international organisations on certain human rights issues, including the rights of minorities. The Commissioner also met members of minority groups.\n75: In his report the Commissioner highlighted the following points:\n76: In a report issued on 21 April 2009 entitled “Freedom of religion and other human rights of non-Muslim minorities in Turkey and of the Muslim minority in Thrace (eastern Greece)”, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly noted the following:\n77: On 27 January 2016 a motion for a resolution entitled “Compatibility of Sharia law with the European Convention on Human Rights: can States Parties to the Convention be signatories of the ‘Cairo Declaration’ was transmitted to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights for report. At its meeting in Strasbourg on 19 April 2016 the Committee accordingly appointed a rapporteur. In an introductory memorandum of 7 October 2016 the rapporteur noted the following:\n78: The relevant provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000/C 364/01) read as follows:\n79: Furthermore, Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation provides that:\n80: On 17 July 2008, in case no. C-303/06, S. Coleman v Attridge Law and Steve Law (ECLI:EU:C:2008:415), the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union addressed the question whether Directive 2000/78 of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, should be interpreted as prohibiting direct discrimination, in that case on grounds of disability, only in respect of an employee who himself has the protected characteristic, or whether the principle of equal treatment and the prohibition of direct discrimination applied equally to an employee who is treated less favourably by reason of the disability of his child, for whom he is the primary provider of the care required by virtue of the child’s condition. In this connection, the CJEU concluded:\n81: On 16 July 2015, in case no. C83/14, CHEZ Razpredelenie Bulgaria AD, ECLI:EU:C:2015:480, the Grand Chamber of the CJEU addressed the question of discrimination by association on the grounds of ethnic origin relating to the interpretation of the Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000, implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular whether the principle of equal treatment should benefit only persons who actually possess the racial or ethnic origin concerned or also persons who, although not being of the racial or ethnic origin in question, nevertheless suffer less favorable treatment on those grounds. The relevant part of the judgment reads:\n82: It appears from the documents available to the Court concerning the legislation of Council of Europe member States that Sharia law can be applied in all those States as a source of foreign law in the event of a conflict of laws in the context of private international law. In such cases, however, Islamic law is not applied as such but as the law of a (non-European) sovereign State, subject to the requirements of public-policy. Outside the sphere of private international law, only one State (France) has officially applied some provisions of Sharia law to citizens of one of its overseas territories (Mayotte). However, the application of those provisions was limited and ended in 2011.\n83: In another State (the United Kingdom), in May 2016 the government commissioned an independent review into the application of Sharia law (in England and Wales) in order to consider “whether Sharia law is being misused or applied in a way that is incompatible with the domestic law in England and Wales, and in particular whether there were discriminatory practices against women who use sharia councils”. In its report of February 2018, that independent review explained that “Sharia councils have no legal status and no legal binding authority under civil law. Whilst sharia is a source of guidance for many Muslims, sharia councils have no legal jurisdiction in England and Wales. Thus if any decisions or recommendations are made by a sharia council that are inconsistent with domestic law (including equality policies such as the Equality Act 2010) domestic law will prevail. Sharia councils will be acting illegally should they seek to exclude domestic law. Although they claim no binding legal authority, they do in fact act in a decision-making capacity when dealing with Islamic divorce.”\n84: The applicant alleged a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention taken alone and in conjunction with Article 14 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, she submitted that by applying Sharia law to her husband’s will instead of Greek civil law, the Court of Cassation had deprived her of three-quarters of her inheritance. Under Article 6 § 1, she complained that the Court of Cassation had refused in her case to apply the ordinary law applicable to all Greek citizens and had adjudicated the dispute on the basis of Sharia law, even though her husband’s will had been drawn up under the provisions of the Greek Civil Code. Relying on Article 6 § 1 read in conjunction with Article 14, she also claimed to have suffered a difference in treatment on grounds of religion.\n85: Being the master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of a case, the Court is not bound by the characterisation given by an applicant or a Government. By virtue of the jura novit curia principle, it has, for example, considered of its own motion complaints under Articles or paragraphs not relied on by the parties. A complaint is characterised by the facts alleged in it and not merely by the legal grounds or arguments relied on (see Şerife Yiğit v. Turkey [GC], no. 3976/05, § 52, 2 November 2010, and Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/10, §§ 123-26, 20 March 2018, and the references therein).\n86: The Court considers that since the main focus of the present case is the Court of Cassation’s refusal to apply the law of succession as laid down in the Civil Code for reasons linked to the Muslim faith of the testator, the applicant’s husband, the primary issue arising is whether there was a difference in treatment potentially amounting to discrimination as compared with the application of the law of succession, as laid down in the Civil Code, to those seeking to benefit from a will as drawn up by a testator who was not of Muslim faith. It will therefore consider the case solely under Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n87: First of all, the Government objected that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies. They emphasised that in her appeal on points of law against the Thrace Court of Appeal’s judgment no. 183/2015 of 15 December 2015 following the remittal of the case (see paragraph 21 above), the applicant had made new submissions which had not been dealt with either by the Court of Cassation’s judgment no. 1862/2013 or by its case-law on the matter in question. The applicant had asked the Court of Cassation to decide whether there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 and Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on the basis of those new submissions. Accordingly, she ought to have waited for the Court of Cassation’s judgment on her appeal on points of law, and should only have applied to the Court if that judgment, which was eventually delivered on 6 April 2017, had been unfavourable to her.\n88: The applicant submitted that the Court of Cassation’s judgment of 7 October 2013 (see paragraph 18 above) had been final inasmuch as, under Article 562 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 34 above), that court could not go back and re-examine the same grounds of appeal that she had already raised before it. Furthermore, she affirmed that she had been obliged to submit a fresh appeal on points of law in order to prepare her defence before the Turkish courts: the proceedings in Turkey had concerned the irrevocability (τελεσιδικία) of judgment no. 183/2015 of the Thrace Court of Appeal, and the deceased’s sisters had argued that the applicant had to lodge a fresh appeal with the Court of Cassation, a view shared by the Istanbul Civil Court of First Instance, which for that reason had adjourned its consideration of the case (see paragraph 31 above).\n89: The Court reiterates that under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, it may only deal with an application after the exhaustion of those domestic remedies that relate to the breaches alleged and are also available and sufficient. The Court also reiterates that it is incumbent on the Government pleading non-exhaustion to satisfy it that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see, in particular, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 76, ECHR 1999V; Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 46, ECHR 2006-II; Vučković and Others v. Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], no. 17153/11 and 29 others, § 74, 25 March 2014, and Gherghina v. Romania [GC] (dec.), no. 42219/07, § 85, 9 July 2015). Once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV, and Prencipe v. Monaco, no. 43376/06, § 93, 16 July 2009).\n90: The Court notes that in the present case the applicant lodged her application with it on 5 March 2014. The judgment of the Court of Cassation allowing the action brought by the applicant’s husband’s sisters and remitting the case to the Thrace Court of Appeal was delivered on 7 October 2013. On 15 December 2015 the latter court came to the same conclusion as the Court of Cassation. Following an appeal on points of law by the applicant on 8 February 2016, the Court of Cassation dismissed her appeal on 6 April 2017. The Court considers that the objection as to non-exhaustion has in any case lost its relevance, because in any event it accepts that the last stage of domestic remedies may be reached after the application has been lodged but before its admissibility has been determined (see Karoussiotis v. Portugal, no. 23205/08, § 57, 1 February 2011).\n91: The Government’s objection of non-exhaustion should therefore be dismissed.\n92: Secondly, the Government invited the Court to reject the application on the grounds that the applicant lacked victim status. They submitted that the judicial decisions given in her case contained no indication that she had been subjected to a difference in treatment on the grounds of sex or religion. The decision to apply Sharia law rather than the relevant Articles of the Civil Code had not been based on any reason connected with her personal status or her “different” religion, but on the nature of the property bequeathed (“property held in full ownership”) and the fact that the testator had been a Muslim. Furthermore, the Government submitted that the applicant had not been entitled to inherit the property in question and had had no legitimate expectation of acquiring it under a will: she had not proved her status as a legitimate heir because she had failed to produce an inheritance certificate.\n93: The applicant argued that she and her deceased husband had fulfilled all the conditions set out in the Civil Code regarding the drawing up of a public will. She added that both the Rodopi Court of First Instance, in its judgment of 1 June 2010 (see paragraph 12 above), and the Thrace Court of Appeal, in its judgment of 28 September 2011 (see paragraph 15 above), had ruled that the impugned will was valid and that the applicant had inherited her deceased husband’s property. She had not only had an expectation of becoming an heir in the future, but also a real and legitimate expectation of fully enjoying her right of ownership of the bequeathed property.\n94: Since the Court of Cassation delivered its judgment on 7 October 2013 (see paragraphs 18-19 above), the applicant has been unable to inherit three-quarters of the property bequeathed to her by her husband, even though the Komotini Court of First Instance approved the will and she accepted her husband’s estate by notarised deed and registered the property transferred to her with the Komotini Land Registry, paying the corresponding registration fees (see paragraph 10 above).\n95: The Court considers that in the particular circumstances of the case, the Government’s objection is so closely linked to the substance of the applicant’s complaint under Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that it should be joined to the merits.\n96: Noting that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds, the Court declares it admissible.\n97: The applicant noted that the annulment of her husband’s will by the Court of Cassation had radically altered the apportionment of the estate between herself and the deceased’s sisters, since she had lost three-quarters of the property bequeathed, even though the Komotini Court of First Instance had approved the will and she had accepted her husband’s estate. Accordingly, she had had a legitimate expectation that the civil courts would adjudicate on the basis of the Civil Code and that she would enjoy her property rights in respect of her entire inheritance.\n98: She further submitted that neither the Court of First Instance nor the Court of Appeal had called into question her entitlement to the estate. Those courts had adjudicated on the basis of the will and the next-of-kin certificate which she had presented, and had not considered an inheritance certificate necessary, whereas according to the Government, this was a fundamental requirement and the Court of Cassation had immediately noted her failure to comply with it. Moreover, a few years before her husband’s death his sisters had accepted their parents’ inheritance arrangements, which had been made in accordance with civil law.\n99: The applicant added that the term “property held in full ownership” used by the Court of Cassation to describe the impugned estate had legal effect only in cases where Sharia law was being applied by a mufti, and was not recognised under civil law.\n100: She contended that the fact that a judicial practice contrary to the fundamental rights of members of the Muslim minority not opting for the application of Sharia law had continued for decades did not justify depriving her of the legitimate expectation that the rules of a law-based State would be applied to her situation.\n101: The applicant submitted that no law in the Greek legal system denied Greek citizens of Muslim faith access to the civil courts, and that only a series of Court of Cassation judgments had deemed the jurisdiction of the muftis compulsory. However, those judgments were based on non-legal considerations treating the Muslim minority as a population to which Sharia law was mandatorily and exclusively applicable. In her submission, imposing on someone, against his or her wishes, a right protecting the religious minority to which he or she belonged encompassed an element of discrimination on grounds of religion and did not pursue a legitimate aim.\n102: With reference to the Thlimmenos v. Greece judgment (no. 34349/97, ECHR 2000-IV), the applicant submitted that the system of protection for Muslims laid down in a special law could only be applied to them if it was optional. The law had to apply the same means to the same types of situation, and the Civil Code afforded everyone, without exception, the right to draw up a public will. In the present case the testator had also enjoyed that right, and so too had she as his heir.\n103: The applicant submitted that religion could only be used as a criterion if a special right was granted on that basis and activated in accordance with the wishes of the person enjoying that right, and not the reverse, that is to say at the discretion of the State. In her view, the automatic application of the special right by the courts according to religious criteria gave rise to a discriminatory difference in treatment.\n104: Lastly, the applicant submitted that making access to the civil courts by members of the Muslim minority conditional upon forfeiting their status as members of that minority would amount to creating a segregationist system in which Sharia law would apply by default to all members of the Muslim minority. Such an approach would contradict the fundamental principle of the law of minorities allowing freedom of choice to accept or refuse the use of a special right intended to protect the minority. In her opinion, such a right could only be “activated” in accordance with the wishes of the person enjoying it and not at the State’s discretion.\n105: The applicant stated that if Sharia law was to retain its place within the Greek legal order as a body of law protecting the Muslim minority, it should not be imposed against the wishes of the person concerned, as had happened in the case of her husband’s estate.\n106: The Government submitted that the applicant could not have harboured any “legitimate expectation” of being recognised as inheriting all the property bequeathed in the will or, consequently, any right of ownership over her deceased husband’s property. They pointed out that she had not presented any deed forming a basis for such a right, instead relying solely on her husband’s will as published by the Rodopi Court of First Instance. However, such publication did not constitute official validation of the will, which had been voidable and had in fact been deprived of legal effect by judgment no. 183/2015 of the Thrace Court of Appeal. Nor had she received from the court the inheritance certificate provided for in Article 1956 of the Civil Code because the existence of her right of inheritance had manifestly been in dispute. The only justification which she had put forward for her right of ownership had been the disputed will. She had therefore lawfully inherited only one-quarter of the property in issue, and not the whole estate.\n107: The Government contended that the conditions laid down in the Court’s relevant case-law, in particular those relating to the lawfulness and foreseeability of the legal basis in domestic law underpinning such an expectation, had not been fulfilled in the instant case. In their view the Court of Cassation’s decision depriving the will of legal effect on the basis of section 4 of Law no. 147/1914 and section 5 of Law no. 1920/1991 and the relevant international treaties had been in line with its settled case-law and had been entirely foreseeable both when the will had been drawn up and at the time of the testator’s death.\n108: The Government submitted that the existence or non-existence of a “legitimate expectation” for the applicant to be recognised as the sole heir was inversely proportional to that of the deceased’s sisters to be recognised as joint heirs by intestate succession under Sharia law. Just as the sisters could not be expected to have anticipated the Court of Cassation reversing its previous position by applying the Civil Code, it was impossible to accept that the applicant could not have foreseen the application of Sharia law in her case.\n109: The Government submitted that the applicant had not been discriminated against in the instant case. The Court of Cassation had confirmed its established case-law and pursued the aim of protecting the Muslim minority in Greece by applying the special law of succession uniformly applicable to a specific category of property belonging to Greek Muslims. In doing so it had protected the specific nature of such property and of its owners, avoiding any infringement of the principle of equality. The settled case-law of the Court of Cassation pursued an aim of overriding public interest in a complex multidimensional area entailing, in particular, respect for and protection of the Thrace Muslim minority, a legitimate aim which was also connected with Greece’s fulfilment of its obligations under international law. It was unthinkable that that aim could be achieved in any other way, in view of the complexity of the many parameters involved, which transcended the individual case.\n110: The Government noted that the applicant had not personally suffered any discrimination on grounds of religion. None of the judicial decisions had referred to her religion as grounds for applying Sharia law to her situation or refusing to recognise her as inheriting all the bequeathed property. The application of Sharia law to the applicant’s case had been based not on her own situation, but on the specific category of property concerned. The decision not to apply Article 1724 of the Civil Code had been based on the nature of the estate, which consisted of property “held in full ownership”.\n111: The Government invited the Court to draw a distinction between the present case and the case of Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey ([GC], nos. 41340/98 and 3 others, ECHR 2003-II). They submitted that in the instant case the Court was not called upon to consider in abstracto the application of a plurality of legal systems based on Sharia law, or its compatibility with fundamental rights. The present case had to be examined in concreto, having regard to such criteria as respect for multiculturalism in today’s Europe and the difficulty of formulating policies applicable to religious communities. In view of the complexity of the “modern identity” of the inhabitants of Europe, the Court should conduct a case-by-case examination of each rule of Sharia law applying to actual cases concerning Muslims residing in non-Muslim States. The complexity criterion should be especially decisive in a case such as the present one, since the domestic courts had referred to international treaties as being the basis of Sharia law.\n112: The Government argued that the lower courts’ decisions had not indicated whether the applicant had entered into a civil marriage with her deceased husband or whether her husband had been aware or had accepted that his will was indisputably null and void in the light of the case-law of the Court of Cassation. Nor had the deceased explicitly declared, regardless of the courts’ assessment of any such declaration, that he wished to waive the implementation of Sharia law in his case. The Government inferred from this that in the five years prior to the applicant’s husband’s death, the persons concerned had taken no action to validly transfer his entire property to his wife. All those factors would have allowed the domestic courts to consider whether they were such as to differentiate the present case from those adjudicated over the past few decades. Although Sharia law did not recognise wills as a mode of inheritance, the Court of Cassation agreed that a will was valid if it was accepted by all those holding the status of heirs under Sharia law. However, in the instant case the consent of the deceased’s sisters to the impugned will had been lacking.\n113: Finally, at the hearing before the Court, the Government maintained that the provisions of the Treaty of Athens, which had been concluded before the incorporation of the Thrace region into Greece, had not applied, at the time of its conclusion, to the Muslim population of Western Thrace. They stated that the provisions on minorities set out in that treaty had lapsed, for two separate reasons: firstly, following the conclusion of the Convention concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations of 30 January 1923 and the transfer to Turkey of all the Muslims settled in Greece, apart from those living in Western Thrace, the aforementioned provisions, which had applied in the regions ceded to Greece in 1913, had been rendered devoid of purpose; and secondly, those provisions had been abrogated by the Treaty of Lausanne of 24 July 1923.\n114: First of all, Christian Concern outlined the increasing influence of Sharia law in the United Kingdom by virtue of its application by the Islamic arbitration tribunals (Sharia Councils), of which there were now more than eighty-five. The operation of these tribunals had raised many problems, because it had allowed Sharia law to become a parallel legal system. The House of Lords had drawn attention to the conflict between Sharia law and United Kingdom law and had described the Islamic Code as “wholly incompatible” with human rights.\n115: Secondly, Christian Concern emphasised that Sharia councils could not, in the civil-law sphere, be treated as an alternative to the ordinary courts, allowing the application of a different set of norms to juridical acts concerning the private lives of a given minority. Sharia law was more than a normative regime, constituting an ethos which prescribed a global vision of the relationship between religion, society and the individual. The inherently discriminatory nature of Sharia law could not be ignored, particularly in so far as it related to women and non-Muslims. In conclusion, Sharia law was often incompatible with the rights guaranteed by the Convention, and individuals should therefore always have a right of appeal to the ordinary courts in order to benefit from the protection of domestic law.\n116: The Hellenic League for Human Rights stated that there was serious confusion within the Court of Cassation concerning the provisions defining the scope of Sharia law. It also noted divergences between the Court of Cassation and the ordinary civil courts, on the one hand, and between the Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court, on the other. The contradictions in the national courts’ approaches to the interpretation of the relevant domestic legislation undermined the requirement of legal certainty, a basic element of the rule of law.\n117: The Hellenic League submitted that the obligatory implementation of religious law did not constitute differential treatment that was justified by the protection of the religious autonomy of the minority. The State’s wish to preserve a given minority’s autonomy and to enhance cultural pluralism could not justify, for the sake of protecting that minority, restricting the fundamental rights of those members of the minority who had decided not to follow its rules and practices.\n118: The Hellenic League stated that European and international practice did not justify granting the Greek authorities a margin of appreciation tending towards the compulsory application of Sharia law. Recourse to Sharia Councils, which was provided for by law in some States (the United Kingdom and the United States) and some infra-State entities (Ontario Province in Canada and the territory of Mayotte), was an option and not an obligation for Muslims living there. Such councils operated as arbitration tribunals, whose decisions enabled the civil courts to take Sharia law into consideration in their own decisions, but recourse to them was not compulsory and did not undermine the application of civil law and the jurisdiction of the civil courts.\n119: First of all, Greek Helsinki Monitor provided an overview of the Court’s case-law on conflicts between provisions originating in different legal orders (citing Pellegrini v. Italy, no. 30882/96, ECHR 2001-VIII; Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, §§ 108-10, ECHR 2005XI; Lombardi Vallauri v. Italy, no. 39128/02, 20 October 2009; and Negrepontis-Giannisis v. Greece, no. 56759/08, 3 May 2011). It submitted that respect for religious autonomy should not lead to uncritical deference to the decisions of religious bodies, particularly when those decisions clashed with fundamental legal principles protected by the Convention.\n120: Secondly, Greek Helsinki Monitor outlined the position of the domestic courts and legal opinion regarding the application of Sharia law and the Islamic law of succession. Thus, although the Court of Cassation had always referred to the State’s international obligations when overturning lower courts’ findings that the application of Sharia law was contrary to the Constitution and the Convention, it had never set out any meaningful counter-arguments to those courts’ findings in its decisions.\n121: Thirdly, Greek Helsinki Monitor referred to the concerns of certain international bodies such as the UN Human Rights Committee (see paragraphs 72-73 above) and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see paragraphs 76-77 above).\n122: The present case concerns the applicant’s right to inherit under a will made in her favour, in accordance with the Civil Code, by a Greek testator of Muslim faith. Whereas the applicant’s husband had decided, in a will drawn up in accordance with civil law before a notary, to bequeath his whole estate to her, the Court of Cassation considered that the Islamic law of succession should be applied to her case. This had the consequence of depriving the applicant of her rights under the will made by her husband, which was rendered without any legal effect. The Court has decided (see paragraph 86 above) to consider the case solely under Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In assessing this complaint the Court will first of all address the question of the applicability of Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It will then seek to establish whether the applicant, as the beneficiary of a will made in accordance with the Civil Code by a testator of Muslim faith, in this case her husband, was in an analogous or relevantly similar situation to that of a beneficiary of a will made in accordance with the Civil Code by a non-Muslim testator, and whether she was treated differently. Finally, should both those questions be answered in the affirmative, the Court will have to determine whether there was any objective and reasonable justification for the difference in treatment.\n123: The Court has consistently held that Article 14 of the Convention complements the other substantive provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto. Article 14 has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded thereby. Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous – there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of them. The prohibition of discrimination enshrined in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and the Protocols thereto require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see, among many other authorities, E.B. v. France [GC], no. 43546/02, §§ 47-48, 22 January 2008; Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 63, ECHR 2010; İzzettin Doğan and Others v. Turkey [GC], no. 62649/10, § 158, 26 April 2016; Biao v. Denmark [GC], no. 38590/10, § 88, 24 May 2016, and Fábián v. Hungary [GC], no. 78117/13, § 112, 5 September 2017).\n124: Furthermore, the concept of “possession” in the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 has an autonomous meaning which is not limited to ownership of material goods and is independent from the formal classification in domestic law: certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as “property rights”, and thus as “possessions” for the purposes of this provision (see Parrillo v. Italy [GC], no. 46470/11, § 211, CEDH 2015 and the references therein).\n125: In each case the issue that needs to be examined is whether the circumstances of the case, considered as a whole, conferred on the applicant title to a substantive interest protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (ibid., § 211; see also Brosset-Triboulet v. France [GC] no. 34078/02, § 65, 29 March 2010 and Fabris v. France [GC], no. 16574/08, § 51, ECHR 2013).\n126: The fact that the domestic laws of a State do not recognise a particular interest as a “right” or even a “property right” does not necessarily prevent the interest in question, in some circumstances, from being regarded as a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Brosset-Triboulet, cited above, § 71). A proprietary interest recognised by domestic law – even if it is revocable in certain circumstances – can constitute a “possession” for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 105, ECHR 2000I).\n127: Finally, the Court reiterates that in cases concerning a complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that the applicant has been denied all or part of a particular asset on a discriminatory ground covered by Article 14, the relevant test is whether, but for the alleged discrimination, the applicant would have had a right, enforceable under domestic law, in respect of the asset in question (see Fabris, cited above, § 52; see also, mutatis mutandis, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 55, ECHR 2005-X).\n128: In the present case, it should be established whether the facts of the case, that is to say the applicant’s inability to inherit under a will made in her favour, in accordance with the Civil Code, fall within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n129: The Court has already dealt with cases where, following a death in a family, close relatives had automatically acquired inheritance rights over the estate, pursuant to the relevant law (see Mazurek v. France, no. 34406/97, § 42, ECHR 2000-II, and Merger and Cros v. France, no. 68864/01, § 32, 22 November 2004). The present case, however, concerns the acquisition of inheritance rights as a result of a will drawn up in accordance with the Civil Code.\n130: In the instant case, it should be noted that by a decision of 10 June 2008 (see paragraph 10 above) the Komotini Court of First Instance approved the will and that on 6 April 2010 the applicant accepted her husband’s estate by notarised deed. The Treasury was notified of that deed. The applicant then registered the property transferred to her with the Komotini Land Registry, paying the corresponding registration fees. The Rodopi Court of First Instance and the Thrace Court of Appeal adjudicated the challenge brought by the deceased’s sisters by validating the will, which the testator had freely chosen to draw up in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Civil Code. The only reason why the applicant did not have the inheritance certificate provided for in Article 1956 of the Civil Code was that the deceased’s sisters had challenged the validity of the will as soon as it had been approved by the Komotini Court of First Instance (see paragraph 11 above). Thus, the applicant would have inherited her husband’s whole estate had the testator not been of the Muslim faith.\n131: In those circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant’s proprietary interest in inheriting from her husband was of a sufficient nature and sufficiently recognised to constitute a “possession” within the meaning of the rule laid down in the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see mutatis mutandis, Fabris, cited above, § 54).\n132: Consequently, the applicant’s proprietary interest falls within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and of the right to respect for property guaranteed therein, which is sufficient to render Article 14 of the Convention applicable.\n133: In order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous or relevantly similar situations (see, among many other authorities, Konstantin Markin v. Russia [GC], no. 30078/06, § 125, ECHR 2012; X and Others v. Austria [GC], no. 19010/07, § 98, ECHR 2013; Khamtokhu and Aksenchik v. Russia [GC], nos. 60367/08 and 961/11, § 64, 24 January 2017, and Fábián, cited above, § 113). In other words, the requirement to demonstrate an analogous position does not require that the comparator groups be identical.\n134: However, not every difference in treatment will amount to a violation of Article 14. Only differences in treatment based on an identifiable characteristic, or “status”, are capable of amounting to discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 (see Fábián, cited above, § 113 and the references therein). In this context, the Court reiterates that the words “other status” have generally been given a wide meaning in its case-law (see Carson and Others, cited above, § 70) and their interpretation has not been limited to characteristics which are personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent (see Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, §§ 56-59, 13 July 2010). For example, a discrimination issue arose in cases where the applicants’ status, which served as the alleged basis for discriminatory treatment, was determined in relation to their family situation, such as their children’s place of residence (see Efe v. Austria, no. 9134/06, § 48, 8 January 2013). It thus follows, in the light of its objective and nature of the rights which it seeks to safeguard, that Article 14 of the Convention also covers instances in which an individual is treated less favorably on the basis of another person’s status or protected characteristics (see Guberina v. Croatia, no. 23682/13, § 78, ECHR 2016 and Škorjanec v. Croatia, no. 25536/14, § 55, 28 March 2017 and also Weller v. Hungary, no. 44399/05, § 37, 31 March 2009).\n135: The Court also reiterates that in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, Article 14 affords protection against different treatment, without an objective and reasonable justification, of persons in similar situations. For the purposes of Article 14, a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it “has no objective and reasonable justification”, that is, if it does not pursue a “legitimate aim” or if there is not a “reasonable relationship of proportionality” between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see Fabris, cited above, § 56).\n136: The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment. The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background (see Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 88, ECHR 2011).\n137: As to the burden of proof in relation to Article 14 of the Convention, the Court has held that once the applicant has demonstrated a difference in treatment, it is for the Government to show that the latter was justified (see Khamtokhu and Aksenchik, cited above, § 65; Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, § 85, ECHR 2013 (extracts); and D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 177).\n138: The first task is to ascertain whether the applicant, a married woman who was a beneficiary of her Muslim husband’s will, was in an analogous or relevantly similar situation to that of a married female beneficiary of a non-Muslim husband’s will.\n139: The Court notes that during his lifetime the applicant’s husband, who was likewise a member of the Thrace Muslim community, had drawn up a notarised public will in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code, bequeathing his entire estate to his wife. It is beyond doubt that she expected, as any other Greek citizen would have done, that on her husband’s death his estate would be settled in accordance with the will thus drawn up.\n140: However, by a judgment of 7 October 2013 the Court of Cassation overturned the Thrace Court of Appeal’s judgment of 28 September 2011 upholding the judgment of the Rodopi Court of First Instance. The Court of Appeal had held that since the testator was free to choose the type of will he wished to draw up in the exercise of his rights, and therefore to draw up a public will in accordance with Article 1724 of the Civil Code, he was not obliged to follow Islamic law, which did not cover matters relating to such wills (see paragraph 15 above). The Court of Cassation, however, found that the Court of Appeal had infringed the law on the grounds that the law applicable to the deceased’s estate had been the Islamic law of succession, which was part of domestic law and which, in Greece, applied specifically to Greek Muslims. More particularly, it held that the estate in question belonged to the mulkia category, as a result of which the public will in issue was voided of all legal effect. In so ruling, the Court of Cassation placed the applicant in a different position from that of a married female beneficiary of the will of a non-Muslim husband. In that connection, the Court also notes that several international bodies have highlighted this issue (see paragraphs 71-77 above).\n141: In conclusion, the applicant, as the beneficiary of a will made in accordance with the Civil Code by a testator of Muslim faith, was in a relevantly similar situation to that of a beneficiary of a will made in accordance with the Civil Code by a non-Muslim testator, and was treated differently on the basis of “other status”, namely the testator’s religion.\n142: The Court reiterates that its role is not to rule on which interpretation of the domestic legislation is the most correct, but to determine whether the manner in which that legislation has been applied has infringed the rights secured to the applicant under Article 14 of the Convention. In the instant case its task is thus to decide whether there was objective and reasonable justification for the difference in treatment in question, which had its basis in the application of domestic law (see, among many other authorities and mutatis mutandis, Fabris, cited above, § 63, and Pla and Puncernau v. Andorra, ECHR 2004-VIII, § 46).\n143: The Government submitted that the settled case-law of the Court of Cassation pursued an aim in the public interest, that is to say the protection of the Thrace Muslim minority. Although the Court understands that Greece is bound by its international obligations concerning the protection of the Thrace Muslim minority, in the particular circumstances of the case, it doubts whether the impugned measure regarding the applicant’s inheritance rights was suited to achieve that aim. Be that as it may, it is not necessary for the Court to adopt a firm view on this issue because in any event the impugned measure was in any event not proportionate to the aim pursued.\n144: It remains to examine the question of the proportionality of the difference in treatment complained of to that aim.\n145: The Court notes first of all that the application of Sharia law to the estate in issue had serious consequences for the applicant, depriving her of three-quarters of the inheritance.\n146: The Court of Cassation and the Government justified that measure primarily on the basis of Greece’s duty to honour its international obligations and the specific situation of the Thrace Muslim minority. The Court notes at the outset that the Court of Cassation applied Islamic inheritance law in the circumstances of the present case on the basis of a provision of international law, namely Article 11 of the 1913 Treaty of Athens, and provisions of domestic law, namely section 4 of Law no. 147/1914, section 10 of Law no. 2345/1920 (enacted pursuant to the 1913 Treaty of Athens) and section 5(2) of Law no. 1920/1991 (see paragraph 18 above).\n147: In its case-law, the civil bench of the Court of Cassation held that the status established for Greek Muslims had not been revoked by the enactment of the Civil Code in 1946, and that section 4 of Law no. 147/1994 had been repealed only in so far as it concerned the Jewish community, and not the Muslim community. It added that although Law no. 1920/1991 had repealed section 10(1) of Law no. 2345/1920, it had incorporated the contents of that provision in its own section 5(2). It held that the aforementioned legislative provisions had been intended to protect Greek Muslims, constituted a special law applicable to interpersonal relations and were not contrary to Article 4 § 1 (principle of equality) and Article 20 § 1 (right to judicial protection) of the Constitution or to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 45 above).\n148: The main consequence of the approach adopted by the Court of Cassation in inheritance cases since 1960 and followed by certain lower courts, to the effect that inheritance matters involving members of the Muslim minority should be governed by Sharia law, is that notarised wills drawn up by Greek nationals of Muslim faith are devoid of legal effect because Sharia law only recognises intestate succession, except in the case of Islamic wills.\n149: The Court reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. Unless the interpretation is arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable, the Court’s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of the interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Radomilja, cited above, § 149). This also applies where domestic law refers to rules of general international law or international agreements (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, § 54, ECHR 1999-I and Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, § 72, ECHR 2008).\n150: At the outset, the Court notes that in the instant case the Court of Cassation based the application of the Sharia law on the nature of the estate, that is to say property “held in full ownership”. However, as the Court understands it, the concept of mulkia is a concept of Islamic law which is only relevant where the deceased’s estate is being settled by a mufti under Sharia law (see paragraph 18 above). In the Court’s view, the justification which Greece derives from Sharia law or from its international obligations is not persuasive, for the following reasons.\n151: The Court notes that there can be no doubt that in signing and ratifying the Treaties of Sèvres and Lausanne Greece undertook to respect the customs of the Muslim minority. However, in view of the wording of the provisions in question (see paragraphs 64-65 above), those treaties do not require Greece to apply Sharia law. Indeed, the Government and the applicant agreed on that point. More specifically, the Treaty of Lausanne does not explicitly mention the jurisdiction of the mufti, but guarantees the religious distinctiveness of the Greek Muslim community, which was excluded from the population exchange provided for in that treaty and was expected to remain in Greece, where the large majority of the population was Christian. Nor did the treaty confer any kind of jurisdiction on a special body in relation to such religious practices. It cannot be overlooked, moreover, that during the hearing the Government stated that the provisions of the Treaty of Athens concerning the protection of the rights of minorities and those of the Treaty of Sèvres were no longer in force, as indeed they had already accepted in the case of Serif v. Greece (no. 38178/97, § 40, ECHR 1999-IX).\n152: The Court also notes that section 5(2) of Law no. 1920/1991, which lists, inter alia, the mufti’s area of competence in inheritance matters, refers solely to Islamic wills and intestate succession, and not to the jurisdiction of muftis over other types of inheritance. As is common in Greece, the notary whose services were called upon by the applicant’s husband agreed to draw up the will as requested by the latter (see paragraph 9 above).\n153: The Court further notes that – as was the situation in the present case – there are divergences in the case-law of the courts as regards, in particular, the question whether the application of Sharia law is compatible with the principle of equal treatment and with international human rights standards. Such divergences exist among courts of the same judicial branch, as well as between the Court of Cassation and the civil courts (see paragraphs 51-53 above) and between the Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 44 above), but also within the Court of Cassation itself (see paragraph 47 above). The divergences create legal uncertainty, which is incompatible with the requirements of the rule of law (see, mutatis mutandis, Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, § 56, ECHR 2000III, and Beian v. Romania (no. 1), no. 30658/05, § 39, ECHR 2007-V (extracts), thus undermining the Government’s main argument as set out above (see paragraph 146 above).\n154: Moreover, the Court can but note that several international bodies have expressed their concern about the application of Sharia law to Greek Muslims in Western Thrace and the discrimination thus created, in particular against women and children, not only within that minority as compared with men, but also in relation to non-Muslim Greeks. Thus, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, in his report on the rights of minorities in Greece, noted that the application of Sharia law to matters concerning family law and inheritance was incompatible with the international undertakings entered into by Greece, particularly after its ratification of the post-1948 international and European human rights treaties, including those relating to the rights of the child and women’s rights. He recommended that the Greek authorities interpret the Treaty of Lausanne and any other early twentieth-century treaty in compliance with the obligations flowing from the international and European human rights instruments (see paragraph 75 above). Other international bodies have made similar findings (see paragraphs 70-73 and 76-77 above).\n155: The Court reiterates that according to its case-law, freedom of religion does not require the Contracting States to create a particular legal framework in order to grant religious communities a special status entailing specific privileges. Nevertheless, a State which has created such a status must ensure that the criteria established for a group’s entitlement to it are applied in a non-discriminatory manner (see İzzettin Doğan and Others, cited above, § 164).\n156: Moreover, it cannot be assumed that a testator of Muslim faith, having drawn up a will in accordance with the Civil Code, has automatically waived his right, or that of his beneficiaries, not to be discriminated against on the basis of his religion. A person’s religious beliefs cannot validly be deemed to entail waiving certain rights if that would run counter to an important public interest (see Konstantin Markin, cited above, § 150). Nor can the State take on the role of guarantor of the minority identity of a specific population group to the detriment of the right of that group’s members to choose not to belong to it or not to follow its practices and rules.\n157: Refusing members of a religious minority the right to voluntarily opt for and benefit from ordinary law amounts not only to discriminatory treatment but also to a breach of a right of cardinal importance in the field of protection of minorities, that is to say the right to free self-identification. The negative aspect of this right, namely the right to choose not to be treated as a member of a minority, is not limited in the same way as the positive aspect of that right (see paragraphs 67-68 above). The choice in question is completely free, provided it is informed. It must be respected both by the other members of the minority and by the State itself. That is supported by Article 3 § 1 of the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities which provides as follows: “no disadvantage shall result from this choice or from the exercise of the rights which are connected to that choice”. The right to free self-identification is not a right specific to the Framework Convention. It is the “cornerstone” of international law on the protection of minorities in general. This applies especially to the negative aspect of the right: no bilateral or multilateral treaty or other instrument requires anyone to submit against his or her wishes to a special regime in terms of protection of minorities.\n158: Lastly, the Court notes that the present case highlights the fact that Greece is the only country in Europe which, up until the material time, applied Sharia law to a section of its citizens against their wishes. This is particularly problematic in the present case because the application of Sharia law caused a situation that was detrimental to the individual rights of a widow who had inherited her husband’s estate in accordance with the rules of civil law but who then found herself in a legal situation which neither she nor her husband had intended.\n159: In that regard, the Court notes that in the member States of the Council of Europe, Sharia law is in general applied as a foreign law within the framework of private international law. Outside that framework, only France has applied Sharia law, to the population of the territory of Mayotte, but that practice ended in 2011. As regards the United Kingdom, the application of Sharia law by the Sharia councils is accepted only in so far as recourse to it remains voluntary (see paragraph 83 above).\n160: The Court notes with satisfaction that on 15 January 2018 the law abolishing the special regulations imposing recourse to Sharia law for the settlement of family-law cases within the Muslim minority came into force. Recourse to a mufti in matters of marriage, divorce or inheritance is now only possible with the agreement of all those concerned (see paragraph 57 above). Nonetheless, the provisions of the new law have no impact on the situation of the applicant, whose case was decided with final effect under the old system in place prior to the enactment of that law (see, mutatis mutandis, Söderman v. Sweden [GC], no. 5786/08, § 107, ECHR 2013).\n161: In conclusion, having regard to the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the difference of treatment suffered by the applicant, as a beneficiary of a will drawn up in accordance with the Civil Code by a testator of Muslim faith, as compared to a beneficiary of a will drawn up in accordance with the Civil Code by a non-Muslim testator, had no objective and reasonable justification.\n162: In the light of the foregoing, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection as to the applicant’s lack of victim status, and finds that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\n163: Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n164: The applicant claimed 967,686.75 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage resulting from the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In support of her claim she produced documents from the Greek tax authorities for the property located in Greece and expert reports drawn up in Turkey for the relevant property there. She also claimed EUR 30,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage resulting from the violation of Articles 6 and 14 of the Convention. She claimed EUR 8,500 in respect of costs and expenses.\n165: The Government contended that the applicant’s claims in respect of pecuniary damage were vague, unsubstantiated and excessive. They submitted that the expert reports presented by the applicant had been drawn up by a firm of foreign experts and concerned property which was not located in Greek territory and had not formed the subject of the proceedings in the Greek courts. Those proceedings had concerned a total of six properties, all located in Komotini, but the applicant had not demonstrated that she had sustained any pecuniary damage: she had simply referred to the property tax (ΕΝΦΙΑ) which she had paid (totalling EUR 373.76). Moreover, the amount on the basis of which the tax authorities had calculated the tax payable had been EUR 42,000, corresponding to the applicant’s share of the estate. As regards the sum claimed in respect of non-pecuniary damage, the Government argued that it was not in conformity with the relevant case-law of the Court. Lastly, they submitted that the applicant’s claim in respect of costs and expenses was likewise vague, unsubstantiated and excessive.\n166: In the circumstances of the case, the Court finds that the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention is not ready for decision. That question must accordingly be reserved in whole and the subsequent procedure fixed, having due regard to any agreement which might be reached between the respondent State and the applicant (Rule 75 § 1 of the Rules of Court). The Court gives the parties three months for that purpose."

            "001-188985\n122: The present case concerns the applicant’s right to inherit under a will made in her favour, in accordance with the Civil Code, by a Greek testator of Muslim faith. Whereas the applicant’s husband had decided, in a will drawn up in accordance with civil law before a notary, to bequeath his whole estate to her, the Court of Cassation considered that the Islamic law of succession should be applied to her case. This had the consequence of depriving the applicant of her rights under the will made by her husband, which was rendered without any legal effect. The Court has decided (see paragraph 86 above) to consider the case solely under Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In assessing this complaint the Court will first of all address the question of the applicability of Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It will then seek to establish whether the applicant, as the beneficiary of a will made in accordance with the Civil Code by a testator of Muslim faith, in this case her husband, was in an analogous or relevantly similar situation to that of a beneficiary of a will made in accordance with the Civil Code by a non-Muslim testator, and whether she was treated differently. Finally, should both those questions be answered in the affirmative, the Court will have to determine whether there was any objective and reasonable justification for the difference in treatment.",
            "001-188985\n161: In conclusion, having regard to the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the difference of treatment suffered by the applicant, as a beneficiary of a will drawn up in accordance with the Civil Code by a testator of Muslim faith, as compared to a beneficiary of a will drawn up in accordance with the Civil Code by a non-Muslim testator, had no objective and reasonable justification.",

            "001-188985\n86: The Court considers that since the main focus of the present case is the Court of Cassation’s refusal to apply the law of succession as laid down in the Civil Code for reasons linked to the Muslim faith of the testator, the applicant’s husband, the primary issue arising is whether there was a difference in treatment potentially amounting to discrimination as compared with the application of the law of succession, as laid down in the Civil Code, to those seeking to benefit from a will as drawn up by a testator who was not of Muslim faith. It will therefore consider the case solely under Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",
            "001-188985\n140: However, by a judgment of 7 October 2013 the Court of Cassation overturned the Thrace Court of Appeal’s judgment of 28 September 2011 upholding the judgment of the Rodopi Court of First Instance. The Court of Appeal had held that since the testator was free to choose the type of will he wished to draw up in the exercise of his rights, and therefore to draw up a public will in accordance with Article 1724 of the Civil Code, he was not obliged to follow Islamic law, which did not cover matters relating to such wills (see paragraph 15 above). The Court of Cassation, however, found that the Court of Appeal had infringed the law on the grounds that the law applicable to the deceased’s estate had been the Islamic law of succession, which was part of domestic law and which, in Greece, applied specifically to Greek Muslims. More particularly, it held that the estate in question belonged to the mulkia category, as a result of which the public will in issue was voided of all legal effect. In so ruling, the Court of Cassation placed the applicant in a different position from that of a married female beneficiary of the will of a non-Muslim husband. In that connection, the Court also notes that several international bodies have highlighted this issue (see paragraphs 71-77 above).",

Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, she submitted that by applying Sharia law to her husband’s will instead of Greek civil law, the Court of Cassation had deprived her of three-quarters of her inheritance. Under Article 6 § 1, she complained that the Court of Cassation had refused in her case to apply the ordinary law applicable to all Greek citizens and had adjudicated the dispute on the basis of Sharia law, even though her husband’s will had been drawn up under the provisions of the Greek Civil Code. Relying on Article 6 § 1 read in conjunction with Article 14, she also claimed to have suffered a difference in treatment on grounds of religion.",

It is beyond doubt that she expected, as any other Greek citizen would have done, that on her husband’s death his estate would be settled in accordance with the will thus drawn up.",
